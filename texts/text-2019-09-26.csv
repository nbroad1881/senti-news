"The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the  2020 cycle  in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air.    But concerns over the trajectory of Vermont independent's second presidential bid as new evidence emerges that Sen.  Elizabeth Warren  is beginning to peel away at his base are becoming more pronounced, along with a realization that a failure to launch in Iowa and New Hampshire could spell the campaign's early doom.       Sanders began his 2020 run dedicated to hammering away at the argument that he, more than any other Democrat, was best positioned to deny President Donald Trump a second term. But Sanders is no longer running as the party's lone progressive populist, as he did in 2016. Warren's emergence in that space, and the sense among some Democrats that she is a better bet to successfully unite the party than Sanders or Biden has altered the shape of the race.  The new dynamic came into sharp relief last weekend, when a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey showed Warren surging into the top tier in Iowa with former Vice President Joe Biden. Sanders, who was well off the pace in third, trailed her in the state by more than 10 points, 22% to 11%.  Perhaps more worrying to some Sanders supporters, the Massachusetts progressive also overtook her colleague from Vermont with what has traditionally been his most reliable bloc of support: voters under 35, among whom Warren now leads in Iowa, 27% to Sanders' 22%.  Asked by a reporter on Sunday about the poll, Sanders said the campaign's internal numbers painted a different picture. But even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire   could be at risk of slipping away.  The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.  ""It can't be this national campaign anymore. He's got to go on TV in Iowa. He's got to park himself in Iowa. He's got to show that he's the underdog fighting back,"" one of the aides told CNN. The aide, who said that staff in Iowa has been ""screaming for Bernie to get on TV"" there, suggested that Sanders had overestimated his strength in Iowa and New Hampshire. ""I think there was initially this sense of, which candidates always want to do, they want to expand,"" the aide said. ""And so I think there was a sense in the campaign, probably a little bit wrongly, that he had an Iowa and New Hampshire base and was going to focus on South Carolina and Nevada and California and expanding. And I think what this is showing is he's got to just go back to basics."" In an interview, campaign manager Faiz Shakir brushed off criticism that Sanders has spent too much time building a national brand, along with the suggestion that it had cost him in those early states. He pointed to Sanders' recent travels in Oklahoma, North Carolina and Colorado as evidence that the campaign is prepared for the long haul. ""We have four fingers in the air,"" Shakir said, referencing the start of the fourth quarter of 2019. ""We are ready to finish strong and, with that, comes an adjustment in the time and attention we pay to certain parts of the map and that includes Iowa and New Hampshire."" But Shakir conceded that the shrinking calendar meant the campaign's margin for error was diminishing too.   ""The arguments that we have framed up for the public, they need to come through clearly in this next period of time,"" he said of Sanders' efforts in Iowa. ""I think delivering that message is absolutely critical here in the fourth quarter. We have put ourselves in a position to do very well."" A second senior aide also indicated that a move to focus more on Iowa and New Hampshire was imminent. That doesn't mean Sanders plans to eschew future trips to join striking union workers outside those states, as he did this week, but that Iowa, where he kicked off his ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour on Monday, is soon likely to serve as a de facto base of operations. Shakir also told CNN that Sanders, after parting ways earlier this year with the firm that made his ads in 2016, has personally decided to use the campaign's in-house team to produce his first round of television spots. The group, a fixture on the trail with the Sanders, began shooting elements for its first TV ad this week. Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have already begun to run ads in the state. Warren on Tuesday announced a planned eight-figure TV and digital ad buy in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. ""We have a major advantage over other campaigns in that we have a lot more cash on hand,"" Shakir said of the campaign's approach to ad expenditures. ""You can use it correctly, or you can squander it. We are trying to stick to our strategy and make sure we are using our resources wisely."" The back-and-forth over the campaign's media strategy has been pointed, but both of the senior aides who spoke to CNN touched on a more fundamental source of internal tension: the increasingly public disconnect between state level operations, most notably seen in New Hampshire, and the campaign's national leadership. Those conflicts have been stoked, the aides said, by mostly lower level staffers, many of them Sanders loyalists from 2016 who have bristled at the 2020 leadership's tone and more exacting standards. A progressive consultant familiar with the campaign's operation in New England told CNN that unsettled Sanders diehards pushed, successfully, for the ouster of former New Hampshire state director Joe Caiazzo, who was reassigned to Massachusetts. Caiazzo, who declined to comment, has been replaced by Shannon Jackson, a more familiar face who managed Sanders' 2018 Senate race. According to a new poll from  Monmouth  released Tuesday, the campaign is facing increased headwinds in New Hampshire, where Warren -- as she did in Iowa -- has surged into the top-tier with Biden. Sanders, again, sits third with 12% to Warren's 27%.    The progressive consultant also said the campaign's internal politics were complicating efforts to broaden its appeal and forge alliances with outside grassroots groups. ""It's very confusing,"" the progressive consultant said of communications with the campaign. ""I have talked to people that hear from all of them -- that hear from (senior adviser) Chuck Rocha, that hear from (senior adviser) Jeff Weaver and that hear from Faiz. But my understanding is that if you want to get to Bernie, it's not Faiz that you go through. It's Weaver or (deputy campaign manager) Ari Rabin-Havt."" For new groups only beginning to make sense of the progressive firmament, the process of sorting out the campaign hierarchy can be a turn-off -- especially when Warren's team has developed a reputation for proactively seeking out those less seasoned activists.  One of the senior Sanders aides conceded that the growing pains have been, at times, sharper than many expected. In 2016, the aide said, the absence at times of a coherent national operation meant that field staff had much more autonomy. The shakeup in New Hampshire, and lower level changes in Iowa, were largely instigated by internal arguments rooted in differing ideas about how to run a successful campaign without betraying the spirit of Sanders' first run. Shakir conceded that there is a level of angst between staff at the local level and the national office. But he insisted that the decisions being made are part of a desire to see the vision of the candidate executed. In the end, he argued, the campaign team -- from top to bottom -- needs to trust in Sanders' judgment. ""We all take our leadership and follow the direction of Bernie Sanders and he drives the strategy, and the argument of how we are going to win people over,"" Shakir said. ""I think to the extent that there's other people on campaign who have different views, I respect and appreciate that. ""But ultimately I believe strongly that we all take our guidance from the top -- and he is the one driving this train."""

"""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,"" Trump told Zelensky on the call, according to a rough  transcript  released by the White House. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.) On two more occasions during that conversation, Trump said he would have Barr (in addition to Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani) get in touch with Zelensky to look into the Biden thing.  Which is problematic, given that Trump is seemingly putting America's attorney general in charge of coordinating an investigation -- with a foreign power! -- into a possible 2020 rival. Knowing what that looks like, the Justice Department released a statement in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday's transcript release, denying that Barr had any contact with the Ukrainians. ""The Attorney General was first notified of the President's conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky several weeks after the call took place, when the Department of Justice learned of a potential referral,"" said Department of Justice Spokesperson Kerri Kupec. ""The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son."" Which, well OK.  What's most striking to me about this whole Ukrainian episode is how -- again -- Barr is somehow in the middle of it. It's the latest in a pattern of behavior by Trump -- and Barr -- that always seems to put the attorney general right at the center of the biggest controversies within the administration. (All of which is all the more remarkable when you consider that  Barr has only been at the head of the Justice Department since February .) Consider: *Barr's  summary of the Mueller report  downplayed, in the eyes of many people (including former special counsel Robert Mueller), the seriousness of the documented episodes of obstructive behavior by Trump. *Barr -- in consultation with then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- decided  not to charge Trump  with obstruction of justice after receiving Mueller's report. *Barr is leading the investigation into the actions of the Justice Department -- including then-FBI Director James Comey -- in advance of the 2016 election. *Barr refused to turn over the full, unredacted Mueller report --  for which Democrats held him in contempt. There are just a lot of roads that lead back to Barr. A LOT. That doesn't mean, of course, that Barr has done anything unethical or wrong. What it does mean, though, is that a) the Justice Department -- under his leadership -- is involved in a large number of things that Trump cares deeply about and b) Trump likes and trusts Barr, and likes to have him around or consult him on a wide variety of issues.   Barr is sort of like Trump's security blanket -- when he sees the AG involved, the President just feels better. Which speaks to how Barr -- in a very short period of time -- has become absolutely essential to Trump and the biggest (and highest-profile) fights of his administration. Everywhere there's controversy for Trump, Barr is there too. He's at the center of history, whether he means to be or not."
"Giuliani's comments came in a heated exchange on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" as Chris Cuomo pressed the former New York mayor over conversations he'd had  with a Ukrainian official  about Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who had investigated the former vice president's son, Hunter. Giuliani has repeatedly pointed to the event as a scandal, even as other Western governments also called for that prosecutor's dismissal and no evidence has indicated Biden's move was inappropriate. That prosecutor was replaced by Yuriy Lutsenko, who would later drop an investigation into a company in which Hunter Biden was involved. ""Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?"" Cuomo asked Giuliani. ""No, actually I didn't. I asked the Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016 by the Ukrainians for the benefit of Hillary Clinton, for which there is already a court finding,"" Giuliani responded.  ""You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden and his role with the prosecutor?"" Cuomo asked.  ""The only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that Lutsenko, who was appointed, dismissed the case,"" Giuliani said.  ""So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?"" Cuomo pressed. ""Of course I did,"" Giuliani said.  When asked about his contradicting answer, Giuliani said he ""didn't ask"" for Biden to be investigated specifically, but asked Ukraine ""to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme."" Giuliani's remarks come the same day  The Washington Post  and  The New York Times  reported that a recent whistleblower complaint about Trump making a ""promise"" to a foreign leader involves Ukraine.  As CNN previously reported , the complaint has led to a standoff between Congress and acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who has refused to turn over the complaint to the House Intelligence Committee."
"Dan Bongino said the Ukraine phone call scandal involving President Trump is the media's attempt to avenge their failed Russia collusion narrative. Fox News contributor  Dan Bongino  said the  Ukraine  phone call scandal involving  President Trump  is the media's attempt to avenge their failed  Russia collusion  narrative, and called their efforts a ""hoax,"" on "" Fox & Friends "" Monday. ""That is the collusion hoax part deux. This is the sequel ... the 'Empire Strikes Back' to the Star Wars collusion hoax,"" he said. ""This is another nonsense thing.

It's so ridiculous,"" Bongino added. ""I can't believe they're falling for this again."" SARAH SANDERS: MEDIA 'HAS EGG ON THEIR FACE' FROM FAILING TO MAKE RUSSIA COLLUSION NARRATIVE STICK Trump was accused of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy into investigating  Joe Biden  and his son, Hunter, for their ties to a natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, which was being investigated as part of a corruption case. This prompted Democratic lawmakers to call for the release of the entire transcript of the call. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bongino called  Rep.

"Democratic candidates hit the dance floor at Iowa event; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' With  Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , pulling ahead of the primary field in the most recent Iowa polling,  Greg Gutfeld  believes the presidential hopeful is just playing the waiting game and letting her competition -- including  former Vice President Joe Biden  -- ""drip"" away voters. ""She's like a bucket under a leak. She doesn't have to do anything, the leaks just fall into her bucket because Sanders is leaking people and Biden is leaking people,"" Gutfeld said on "" The Five "" Monday.

NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT The latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll  showed Warren as the first choice for 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was first choice of 20 percent of the voters. In June, the Register poll showed Biden leading with 24 percent support, nine percentage points clear of Warren and eight points clear of Sanders. While Biden continues to lead in national polls some are concerned about his current standing.

"Now Ukraine has become wrapped in the Trump presidency's many subplots: the role of Russia and President Vladimir Putin, the legacy of Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, Trump's reelection outlook and a loose network of advisers not always operating in concert. The result is renewed focus on a country Trump once sought to tune out but where he now sees a political opportunity. His approach to Ukraine melds political and national security concerns fanned by some of his closest advisers. Trump has raised the issue involving the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden repeatedly in private conversations and believes there is a political opportunity in further probing the matter, the people familiar with the matter said. He's been urged along by his private attorney,  Rudy Giuliani, who told CNN on Thursday evening  that he'd pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son. Giuliani has maintained that he has been acting on his own and not at the direction of the President as he meets with Ukrainian officials. But Giuliani is aware that the issue has gotten Trump's attention, according to the people familiar with the situation. And Trump has raised it multiple times, in person and on the phone.  A source close to the White House who is familiar with Trump's comments said the President has been seething for months about Ukraine and Biden. The source described Trump as ""angry"" about what he sees as a liability for the former vice president. The source also said Giuliani has been ""egging him on."" Trump told reporters on Friday that ""somebody ought to look into"" the Biden matter, and said that ""it doesn't matter what I discussed"" during a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. CNN reported on Friday that in that call,  Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden's son . Trump is due to meet next Wednesday with Zelensky in New York. Trump was not initially interested in meeting with Zelensky or engaging with him, viewing him as an extension of the country's previous leader, President Petro Poroshenko. Trump believed Ukraine was a corrupt country that wasn't committed to reform, according to people familiar with his thinking at the time. The phone call and meeting come after months of back and forth between Trump and his advisers, who have worked to convince him that engaging the new Ukrainian leader is worth his time and effort for national security reasons. The country's attacks on Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, with accusations of him laundering money with offshore accounts, were the ultimate foundation for the President's beliefs.  Trump also consistently cast Ukraine -- a portion of which was annexed by Russia in 2014 -- as a messy situation created by his predecessor that he was unenthusiastic about wading into himself. ""He had never been concerned or interested in Ukraine,"" one person familiar with Trump's thinking said.  ""Obama lost it,"" was Trump's view, the person said, adding that the President always seemed ""more interested in engaging Putin than Zelensky.""  Trump's ties to Putin have been heavily scrutinized, and he's been accused of showing deference to the Russian leader. He's also remained fixated on Obama, frequently seeking to unravel his legacy. That lack of interest in Ukraine appeared to shift over the summer, when some of Trump's national security advisers worked to convince him that engaging Ukraine's new leader would benefit US national security interests. Though Trump continued to remain skeptical, he told his advisers he was open to being convinced of further engagement.  Then-national security adviser John Bolton and other senior Trump administration officials invited Oleksandr Danylyuk, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, to Washington for meetings in early July. They went well, and the White House saw it as a ""sign of encouragement"" to nudge Trump toward working with Ukraine.  The renewed engagement happened to dovetail with Giuliani's efforts to convince Ukrainian officials to look into Biden and his son -- an effort Giuliani spoke about publicly and that quickly caught Trump's attention. Even before Zelensky took office, Giuliani made known he was looking to set up a meeting to discuss an investigation into Burisma, the natural gas company where Biden's son Hunter had served on the board of directors. Giuliani's meetings occurred over the summer, just as US administration officials were working to spark Trump's interest in Ukraine. The parallel efforts seemed to be the launchpad for convincing Trump to engage with Ukraine more robustly. Three weeks later, Trump spoke by phone with Zelensky for the first time, in a call that is now under intense scrutiny for its potential role in the  whistleblower's complaint . Later, aides worked to arrange a meeting in Poland, though Trump ultimately did not make the trip because of a hurricane in the United States. People familiar with the matter said Bolton and the other US officials who met with Danylyuk in early July did not discuss the Biden matter. But the issue was known, and colored the talks. ""That was a bizarre situation, but it all seemed to be dealt with in Giuliani track,"" a person familiar with the meetings said. ""It was out there, but it was being handled by Giuliani. We did not deal with that because he [Giuliani] was talking about it and saying he was a private citizen."" At the same time, the administration begin reviewing $250 million in foreign aid to Ukraine, initially placing a hold on the package that angered some in Congress. The issue provided another wedge between Bolton, who was an advocate for the aid, and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who pushed for the package to be reviewed.  The money was released last week . It's not known how, if at all, the foreign aid was related to the Biden matter. And a person familiar with the situation said Friday that Trump had not discussed the pending aid package during the July 25 call with Zelensky. But even before this week's revelations about the intelligence whistleblower, Democrats in Congress had accused the administration of engaging in a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government. Through it all, Trump's interactions and meetings on Ukraine have been treated with special sensitivity within the administration. The State Department never got extensive readouts of his calls. And few people within the administration learned precisely what was discussed. ""There was concern about leaks,"" one person said of the tight hold on information."
"'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on why President Trump's handling of the latest showdown with Iran is drawing increased media criticism, especially from the likes of John Bolton and neocons. John Bolton had to know he was sending a message to the man who pushed him out of the White House. And a strong message it was, disagreeing with the president on just about every foreign policy hot spot. The recently departed national security adviser was speaking to a Manhattan luncheon for the Gatestone Institute, a conservative think tank he once chaired. About 60 people were gathered at Le Bernadin, including such hotshots as Alan Dershowitz, former attorney general Michael Mukasey and Newsmax chief Chris Ruddy. So the leak, in this case to Politico, was inevitable. The former Fox News contributor certainly gets that any words uttered before such a large audience will soon find their way into print. SIZE MATTERS? MEDIA PRAISE ELIZABETH WARREN -- AND HER CROWDS What’s fascinating here is that the Bolton broadside comes as Trump’s handling of the latest showdown with Iran is drawing increasing media criticism, especially from the right. The president is essentially in a no-win situation, whether he chooses a military strike against Iran or sticks with diplomacy and sanctions. The neocon wing of the GOP wants him to retaliate for the attack on Saudi oil facilities that our intel agencies are blaming on Iran, and is casting his reluctance as a sign of weakness. Bolton told the luncheon that any negotiations were Iran (and North Korea) are “doomed to failure,”  according to Politico. “Bolton also said more than once that Trump’s failure to respond to the Iranian attack on an American drone earlier this summer set the stage for the Islamic Republic’s aggression in recent months…Bolton said the planned response had gone through the full process and everybody in the White House had agreed on the retaliatory strike. But ‘a high authority, at the very last minute,’ without telling anyone, decided not to do it.” Reporters quickly asked Trump for his response. “John was not able to work with anybody, and a lot of people disagreed with his ideas,” he said. “A lot of people were very critical that I brought him on in the first place because of the fact that he was so in favor of going into the Middle East, and he got stuck in quicksand and we became policemen for the Middle East. It’s ridiculous.” SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES The president was referring to the Iraq war and Bolton’s role in the Bush administration. Trump ran against that war, and endless wars, and obviously wants to get out of Afghanistan. The neocons are growing more critical of Trump’s reluctance to pull the trigger in these situations. He even got into a little spat with his pal Lindsey Graham, who said, like Bolton, that the president’s failure to strike back after Iran downed an American drone is what paved the way for the attack that cut Saudi oil production in half. The Beltway press, as part of an establishment whose kids are rarely sent off to fight, often reflects these pro-war instincts. Iraq, you’ll recall, was going to be a cakewalk. Bret Stephens, a conservative  New York Times  columnist who detests the president, wrote yesterday that Trump’s policy is “locked, half-cocked, and probably bluffing.” He said this president combines “the rhetorical impulses of Bob Dornan with the strategic instincts of Dennis Kucinich.” Trump does like to talk tough with foreign adversaries. And obviously he has ordered airstrikes before. But it’s no accident that he threatened to incinerate North Korea and wound up in a pen pal relationship with Kim Jong-un. And yet if he keeps turning to sanctions and diplomacy, does there come a point where he looks like Barack Obama and his Syrian red line? Trump is bound to disappoint the neocons by exercising restraint when it comes to military options, knowing full well that there are unintended consequences that could bog down U.S. troops for years to come. That means he’s likely to face continued criticism from John Bolton, but might be in tune with the war-weary portion of the country."

Tension between United States and Iran to boil over as world leaders prepare to meet at the United Nations. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: These are the highest sanctions ever imposed on a country. We've never done it to this level. ROBERTS: The United States continues its campaign of maximum pressure on the Islamic regime and -- MARK ESPER, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: The president has approved the deployment of U.S. forces, which will be defensive in nature. ROBERTS: Points the finger at Tehran for those Saudi oil attacks. MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We know precisely who conducted these attacks, it was Iran. ROBERTS: We'll ask Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the options on the table live only on ""FOX News Sunday"". Then, we'll get reaction from Democrat Ben Cardin, a key member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It's a ""FOX News Sunday"" exclusive. Plus, reports the president had an inappropriate phone call with the president of Ukraine. REPORTER: Did you discuss Joe Biden, his son, or his family? TRUMP: It doesn't matter what I discussed. It's a partisan whistle- blower. JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know I'm up against it. A serial abuser. That's what this guy is. He abuses power everywhere he can. ROBERTS: We'll discuss with President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Plus, ask or send a panel how the growing controversy is fueling impeachment talks. All right now on ""FOX News Sunday"". (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: And hello again from FOX News in Washington. The war of words over the Saudi oil attacks, which the United States blames on Iran, has turned into action, the Pentagon announcing it will send more troops to the region to boost security for allies and President Trump approving new sanctions on Iran's central bank. But the president also signaling he is not inclined to authorize an immediate military strike, which the Iranian regime has declared would mean all-out war. In a moment, we'll speak with the president's top diplomat, Mike Pompeo, who just returned from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. But first, Kevin Corke is traveling with the president, who has a rally today in Houston with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Kevin, good morning. KEVIN CORKE, CORRESPONDENT: John, good day to be with you. Right. We'll have more on that rally coming up in just a few moments, but by any measure, John, the Iranians are suffering greatly under this latest round of U.S. sanctions, just one of many weapons in the U.S. arsenal as it considers what to do next about Iran's Saudi attack. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: We have just sanction the Iranian national bank. It's going to be at the highest level of sanctions. CORKE: We'll see what happens, a familiar refrain from President Trump. When asked with the U.S. might do next to respond to Iran's attacks on Saudi oil fields. Iran denies it was behind those attacks. In addition to more sanctions, the president has authorized sending a battery of U.S. forces to the region at Saudi request. ESPER: As the president has made clear, the United States does not seek conflict with Iran. That said, we have many other military options available should they be necessary. CORKE: The strikes, which Washington says it can prove came from Iran, have pushed the regent to the brink. For its part, Tehran is threatening to escalate the violence should the U.S. or the Saudis attack even in limited form. MAJOR GENERAL HOSSEIN SALAMI, IRAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD COMMANDER: A limited invasion will not remain limited. We hand down and punish. We have proven it before. CORKE: That warning comes under day that saw the regime put its military capabilities on display, with a series of parades to mark the 39th anniversary of the start of the Iran-Iraq war and comes months after the Iranians downed and a American surveillance drone in international airspace. This in a week that will see a gathering of world leaders at United Nations General Assembly in New York where Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says he'll present a Gulf security plan. (END VIDEOTAPE) CORKE: All this as the U.S. welcomes another world leader. This time it's Narendra Modi, as you mentioned, the prime minister of India. He's here for a ""Howdy, Modi"" Texas rally with President Trump. It is set to be the largest American audience to see a foreign leader speak other than the pope. We'll bring it to you throughout the day. But for now, thank you. ROBERTS: OK, Kevin Corke, thanks very much. The president with an afternoon event with Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia as well. Kevin, we'll see you soon. Thanks. Joining me now from New York is the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday"". POMPEO: John, it's great to be with you. ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, earlier in the week, you said of the attack against the Saudi oil facilities that it was, quote, an act of war, and you said that Iran was definitely behind it. When you say something is an act of war, does that demand ultimately a military response? POMPEO: Well, John, our mission set has been very clear. President Trump would like to have a diplomatic solution, that's the task that's in front of us. That's what we've been aiming for for a little over two years now with the strongest sanctions that have ever been put in place against this revolutionary regime. And, John, you know the history. Forty years of terror from Iran. It's an anti-Semitic set of leaders that would like to wipe Israel and America from the face of the earth. Our mission set is to avoid war. You saw what Secretary Esper announced on Friday, we're putting additional forces in the region for the purpose of deterrence and defense, with our objective to be very clear, to support the Iranian people so that they can get this regime to cease behaving in a way that is so destructive not only to their own country, but to the entire Middle East. ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, there are reports this morning that Houthi militants in Yemen have warned both Saudi Arabia and the United States that Iran may be planning another attack in Saudi Arabia. Is that true? POMPEO: So, I've certainly seen that reporting and I won't talk about American intelligence and what we know. But suffice it to say, we are consistently concerned that Iran will continue to behave in the way that it has now for 40 years, it did so before the JCPOA, it did so during the JCPOA, and they continue to act in ways that are inconsistent with our obligations. I'm here this week at the United Nations. I traveled to Jeddah and to Abu Dhabi this week. The whole world understands that Iran is the bad actor. They are the evil force in the region. They are destabilizing in the Middle East, and I hope this week here in New York, the whole world will come together to push back against this and convince the Iranian leadership that this behavior is simply unacceptable. ROBERTS: That may be a tough hill to climb though, yes? POMPEO: I think there's a handful of countries that are actually supportive of Iran and what Iran is doing are certainly unwilling to push back. But it's the case; this is the world's responsibility to respond from these state-on-state acts of war that took place in Saudi Arabia this past week. ROBERTS: If Iran were to launch, in the middle of all of this, another attack against Saudi Arabia, would the United States have any other option but to respond militarily? POMPEO: John, unlike the previous administration, we try -- we do our best to avoid talking about what we will do, but the American people should know, just like the Iranian people should know, America is prepared to respond in ways that are consistent with America's national security interests. Our first aim, of course, is to keep the American people safe and secure, and part of that is to make sure that we have all the things in place so that we can do that. ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, many military and foreign policy experts, even members of the president's own support group, believe that in calling off the retaliatory strike in response to that drone shoot-down at the last minute, the president signaled to Iran that there are no consequences for its malign activities. What do you say to that criticism? POMPEO: Well, first of all, there have been consequences, real consequences. The Iranian economy will shrink by between 10 and 15 percent in the year in front of us, and we took a handful of actions, some of which I can't talk about here. So there were certainly consequences. The Iranians aren't looking for a green light. The Iranians have behaved poorly for 40 years. And so, it's not the case that any particular response has allowed the Iranians to think they have freedom to move about the cabin (ph). I assure you of this: the Iranian leadership understands four-square that President Trump will take appropriate action and impose appropriate costs on Iran if they continue to act in the way that they've done over these past now 40 years. ROBERTS: You mentioned, Mr. Secretary, at the beginning of this, the sanctions that President Trump put on Iran. On Friday, he said that there were sanctions at the highest level. If these sanctions don't work, what's next? What's left? POMPEO: Well, they are working, John. The toughest of the sanctions, the essential ban on the -- Iran's ability to sell its crude oil around the world took effect only -- (CROSSTALK) POMPEO: -- in May of this year. ROBERTS: But what I mean is if they don't work -- if they don't work to bring Iran to the table. POMPEO: As Secretary Esper said on Friday night, we're prepared to act in ways that are necessary in order to achieve the outcome President Trump has very clearly laid out. I talked about it a year ago, in May. We know what the objectives are. We simply want Iran to behave like a normal nation. ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, is it possible that if there were a retaliatory military strike against Iran, that it would be able to be contained, or would it, as Javad Zarif and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Council have warned, erupt into all-out conflagration in the Middle East, which would likely involve U.S. bases in the region, would likely also possibly involve Israel? POMPEO: We're certainly deeply aware of the risks. That's why we want to resolve this in a way that doesn't resort to kinetic action, if it's at all possible to achieve that. But as for Zarif, I don't know why nobody listens to him. He has nothing to do with Iranian foreign policy. He lies all the time. We need to make sure that we do the right things to protect and secure America and do our best to provide the resources to the Emirates and the Saudis, who I had a chance to speak to this week on my trip, so that they have increased capability to defend themselves and their own people. And when we -- when we do those things, I'm confident that we will have set the conditions for deterrence. And if that deterrence should continue to fail, I'm also confident President Trump will take the actions that are necessary. ROBERTS: All right. We will see what happens at the United Nations General Assembly this week. I'll see you there later on today. Let's switch to this whistleblower complaint. We still don't know the exact substance of the complaint but it does seem to revolve around a July 25th conversation the president had with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And we have heard from reporting in ""The Wall Street Journal"" that the president asked Zelensky about eight times to have the Ukraine work with his attorney Rudy Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's involvement in Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. To your mind, is that an appropriate conversation for Rudy Giuliani to be having with Ukrainian officials? POMPEO: Well, John, you're asking me to comment on an I.C. (ph) report I haven't seen and some reporting -- I have no idea if that has any foundation whatsoever. As for appropriate action, I've watched the president engage with the Ukrainian leadership. I listened to conversations. I remember the previous administration refusing to send defensive weapon systems to Ukraine. This president has chosen to do that not once, not twice, but now three times, so that the Ukraine people could fight back against the overtaking of southeast Ukraine. You remember, it was the previous administration that allowed Vladimir Putin to take one fifth of the Ukrainian country. We're going to see President Zelensky this week. I do hope -- I do hope that if Vice President Biden engaged in behavior that was inappropriate, if he had a conflict of interest or entered (ph) -- or allowed something to take place in Ukraine which may have interfered in our elections in 2016, I do hope that we get to the bottom of that. ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, you said that you have not seen the complaint, not many people have. I assume, though, that you have seen a transcript of the telephone call that the president had with Zelensky. Should a transcript of that be released to clear the air? POMPEO: I'll ultimately leave that to the White House. But you know, John, those are private conversations between world leaders, and it's -- it's not often that those are released. And when they're done, it's done when the White House deems it appropriate. And I'll leave whether that should be released to them. ROBERTS: Again, I assume that you've seen the transcript. Is it as described in ""The Wall Street Journal""? POMPEO: You know, I haven't seen ""The Wall Street Journal"" piece, John. There's a lot going on in the world. ROBERTS: Right. The whistleblower complaint reportedly alleges a quid pro quo or a promise made to a foreign leader. ""The Wall Street Journal"" reports there was no evidence of a quid pro quo in that call with Zelensky. Was there a quid pro quo -- was there a request to investigate Biden and/or his son? And was that linked to a promise of aid? POMPEO: John, I've watched this president evaluate how and when and to the extent we should provide support to Ukraine, both defense assistance and other foreign assistance, we've been at the center of that. Those conversations have always been 100 percent appropriate, 100 percent lawful, and 100 percent ensuring that the American taxpayers were protected, that we put those resources to good use and we've got good outcomes in Ukraine when we used American taxpayer dollars to support the Ukrainian leadership -- every single time, John. ROBERTS: If there was a quid pro quo, would that be a problem? POMPEO: John, you're asking me to provide legal analysis on a hypothetical on a report I haven't seen. Come on. ROBERTS: I mean, if an American leader says to a foreign leader, we will do this and it might have something to do with USA, in exchange for this, is that a problem? POMPEO: John, it's the case we have foreign assistance that is evaluated against American objectives consistently. It's my duty to protect America by making sure that when foreign assistance is provided to countries, that America benefit from that. And it's completely appropriate to make sure that American taxpayer dollars are used appropriately. ROBERTS: Do believe that there should be an investigation into Hunter Biden's involvement with the Ukrainian gas company? POMPEO: I'll leave that to others, but I certainly think it's appropriate if there's concerns and there's enough information to justify looking into it. The American people deserve to know if that was handled in an appropriate way by Vice President Biden. ROBERTS: Just before we go, Mr. Secretary, are you ruling out a run for the Senate from Kansas next year? POMPEO: I've said the same thing, John, for a long time. As long as President Trump is going to have me as secretary of state, which I hope is a long time, that's what I'm going to continue to do. ROBERTS: I'm sure he wants you as secretary of state for a long time. I'm just wondering if you still have aspirations for the Senate. POMPEO: It's what I want to do, too. I want to be President Trump's secretary of state. ROBERTS: All right. Secretary Pompeo, we'll see you later on in New York. POMPEO: Thank you, sir. ROBERTS: Thanks for joining us. We'll be following all the action, of course, at the United Nations General Assembly next week. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: Interactions between President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and the president of Ukraine are under scrutiny following reports of a whistle- blower complaint, claiming that the president urged the Ukrainian to investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, potentially influencing the 2020 race. Joining me here live in Washington to talk more about this is Mr. Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Rudy, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday."" RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How are you? How are you, John? ROBERTS: I'm good. Thanks for joining us. Let's clear something up, first of all. GIULIANI: Sure. ROBERTS: Let's dial the clock back to Thursday, play this exchange between you and Chris Cuomo on CNN, in which you appeared to at first say you didn't ask Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and/or his son, and then you seemed to change her mind. GIULIANI: Right. ROBERTS: Listen. Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CUOMO, CNN: Did you to ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden? GIULIANI: No. Actually, I didn't. CUOMO: You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden... GIULIANI: The only thing I asked about Joe Biden... CUOMO: ... and his role with the prosecutor? GIULIANI: ... is to get to the bottom of how it was that Lutsenko, who was appointed... CUOMO: Right. GIULIANI: ... dismissed the case against AntAC. CUOMO: So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden? GIULIANI: Of course I did. CUOMO: You just said you didn't. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: All right, so which is it? Did you ask the Ukraine -- did you ask the Ukraine -- did you ask Ukraine to look into it or not? (CROSSTALK) GIULIANI: I clarified it immediately. ROBERTS: All right. GIULIANI: He said to me, did you ever talk about Joe Biden? I said no. Then I said, I did say that you should investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. The no was obviously wrong. I corrected it immediately. ROBERTS: GIULIANI: I corrected it before he corrected it. The reality is, the distinction is this. What they are trying to say is, I went there for a political mission to kind of get Joe Biden in trouble. Ridiculous. I went there as a lawyer defending his client. I -- I have known about this for five months. I have been trying to get people to cover this for five months. So, I knew it would be very, very hard to get this out. And what I'm talking about, this, it's Ukrainian collusion, which was large, significant, and proven with Hillary Clinton, with the Democratic National Committee, a woman named Chalupa, with the ambassador, with an FBI agent who's now been hired by George Soros who was funding a lot of it. When Biden got the prosecutor fired, the new prosecutor, who Biden approved -- you don't get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country, unless something fishy is going on. The new prosecutor dropped the case, not just on Biden's kid and the crooked company that Biden's kid work for, Burisma. That was done as a matter of record in October of 2016, after the guy got tanked. He also dropped the case on George Soros' company called AntAC. AntAC is the company where there's documentary evidence that they were producing false information about Trump, about Biden. Fusion GPS was there. Go back and listen to Nellie Ohr's testimony. Nellie Ohr says that there was a lot of contract between Democrats and the Ukraine. Well, I have all the contacts. And, John, when the rest of this comes out, and when you look at China and the $1.5 billion that the -- that the Biden family took out of China while that guy was negotiating for us, this will be a lot bigger than Spiro Agnew. They have fallen into a trap. ROBERTS: So, you went over there to investigate alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election? GIULIANI: Yes. And if I can't do that, I can't defend a client. I... ROBERTS: All right, so when did this morph into an investigation of Joe Biden and Hunter Biden? And is it appropriate for you, as a representative of the president, to be going to Ukraine and finding dirt on Joe Biden and/or his son to use politically in 2020? GIULIANI: Well, that's the way you characterize it. It's certainly appropriate... ROBERTS: That's the way it appears to line up. GIULIANI: No, it doesn't. ROBERTS: You went there for one thing, you found out something else, and that's what you have been digging on this. (CROSSTALK) GIULIANI: That's the way the pro-Biden media lines it up. This began with someone coming to me saying, this information can clear your client about the corruption in Ukraine between the Ukraine, the Democratic Party, the ambassador, and the FBI agent who investigated the case. (CROSSTALK) ROBERTS: But it then -- but then it morphs into Biden. GIULIANI: And -- inextricably combined, because Biden had the guy fired, Shokin. By the way, his statement is on record. The lazy press could go read it. They don't have to listen to me. There are three videotapes of prosecutors on record, available on here, that nobody has covered for five months, because this town protects Joe Biden. His family has been taking money from his public office for years, $1.5 billion from China, when our vice president is supposed to be impartially and independently negotiating for us? And the kid, he takes him on Air Force Two to China, and the kid... ROBERTS: That was in 2013. GIULIANI: Yes. And the kid, unfortunately, is a drug addict. China didn't give $1.5 billion to his kid, Biden's kid, a recovering drug addict, Kerry's stepson, and Whitey Bulger's nephew. Ladies and gentlemen, go look at what the press has been covering up on you. Can you imagine... ROBERTS: This is a company called Rosemont Seneca. Let me just -- let me just come back, if I could. GIULIANI: You got to stop for a second. Whitey Bulger's nephew? ROBERTS: Let me just stop for a second. GIULIANI: One-point-five billion coming from China, when our vice president... (LAUGHTER) ROBERTS: Mr. Mayor... GIULIANI: That doesn't shock you? ROBERTS: ... let me stop for a second, because... GIULIANI: I mean, how far have we deteriorated? ROBERTS: Let me stop for a second, because we are throwing around a lot of Ukrainian names that people don't know about. GIULIANI: Well, that's because nobody would ever cover this. ROBERTS: Viktor Shokin was a prosecutor back when Biden was the vice president. He was looking into Burisma Holdings... GIULIANI: Right. ROBERTS: ... of which Hunter Biden was on the board of directors. GIULIANI: Correct. ROBERTS: There were some allegations that there was some monkey business going on with Burisma. (LAUGHTER) ROBERTS: Joe Biden -- Joe Biden -- Joe Biden went over to Ukraine in 2016... GIULIANI: Right. ROBERTS: ... and said that, I'm going to withhold more than a billion dollars in loan guarantees unless you fire this prosecutor. Joe Biden talked about that in 2018. Let's roll that. GIULIANI: Right. (LAUGHTER) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars. I said, you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here. And I think it was, what, six hours. I look at it. I said, we're leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: But Shokin had been heavily criticized for corruption. And it was the United States and a number of other Western countries who said... GIULIANI: So is everybody in the Ukraine. ROBERTS: ... he needs to go. GIULIANI: More relevant... ROBERTS: So, was this tied to Hunter Biden, or was this the United States saying, you have got a bad actor there, because he was accused of corruption in his office? And other countries in the West were saying he needs to go as well. GIULIANI: What does it matter, if the -- if the son is under investigation? He didn't disclose that. Doesn't the thing strike you? I mean, it is so warped. Doesn't it strike you as strange that he would tell that story and not mention to you that his son's company was the major defendant in the investigation, the guy who was carrying on? Do you -- I happen to know -- and I have seen the records -- do you know why he was fired? Do you know how the kid was paid? Three million dollars goes from Ukraine to Cyprus -- I'm sorry -- Ukraine to Latvia, Latvia to Cyprus, Cyprus to Rosemont Seneca. I have seen each one of the wires. When that prosecutor, Shokin, subpoenaed Cyprus, he got a response. I have the record. They gave him all the information, but two people, Hunter Biden and John Kerry's stepson -- I'm sorry -- John Kerry's speechwriter, who was the best friend of his stepson. ROBERTS: The prosecutor who followed.. GIULIANI: When that happened, Joe Biden knew that they were zeroing in on Hunter. And he went over there and he got him fired. And the next day, people showed up. And they started on getting the case for the kid dismissed, as well as the case for Soros. And that's what brings me into it. ROBERTS: Now, the prosecutor -- the prosecutor... GIULIANI: No, you got to let me finish. ROBERTS: OK. GIULIANI: He said, I went there to get dirt on Joe Biden. Do you know, when I found out about Joe Biden, do know what I told my colleague? They are going to cover this up. Too bad Biden is involved in this. I got a nice straight case of Ukrainian collusion. The minute I say Biden, that Washington press corps is going to go nuts. They have been covering up for years, China, plagiarism. ROBERTS: OK. OK. All right. Now you're straying into areas of opinion, as opposed to fact. GIULIANI: No, I'm not. I'm straying into what is wrong with us today and the unfairness. ROBERTS: We need to point out -- we need to point out that Yuriy Lutsenko, who was the prosecutor who was appointed after Shokin was fire... GIULIANI: Approved by... ROBERTS: ... resurrected, reanimated the case, and found that Hunter Biden was, in fact, paid millions of dollars. But Lutsenko said that the board of Burisma was able to pay a board member whatever they wanted, and he didn't see anything wrong with that. GIULIANI: John, how is the coverage so distorted? ROBERTS: I'm just pointing out a fact. GIULIANI: If you did any work, you would find out Lutsenko is the prosecutor that Biden put in. There's a newspaper article in which Biden approves Lutsenko when he's appointed. Doesn't that strike you as odd, that the vice president would approve a particular prosecutor? Did you ever bother to look? (CROSSTALK) GIULIANI: Let me finish. ROBERTS: One other point we need to make here before we go. GIULIANI: No, no, no, I want answer another question unless you let me finish. This is really unfair. These are very important things that have been covered up for years to protect slimy Joe. The reality is that there are three other prosecutors where all you have to do is go online, three others, that say that this was done precisely to get rid of Biden, to cover up Hunter, and to cover up Soros. I will give you their names. One of them is Kulik, Konstantin Kulik. The other is Shokin himself. And the third one is a prosecutor by the name of Inazdir (ph). They are present officials. Three of them were officials. One is still an official of the Ukrainian government. If you bothered to look, you could listen to them on tape telling you that. Now, they may all be lying, but Lutsenko may be lying also. But it's 3-1. ROBERTS: One more point we got to make. GIULIANI: And Lutsenko is Biden's chosen prosecutor. ROBERTS: OK. You have made your point. One more point to make we need to make. GIULIANI: You will also find there is a great deal of suspicion. ROBERTS: Yes, Joe Biden yesterday told our Peter -- Joe Biden told our Peter Doocy yesterday that he never discussed overseas business with his son Hunter. GIULIANI: Do you believe that? ROBERTS: I don't know. Do you believe that? GIULIANI: I'm flying my son to China. How long is the flight to China? ROBERTS: Its a while. GIULIANI: Fifteen hours, 16 hours, 17? I'm flying my son to China on Air Force Two. I'm going to negotiate with the Chinese to help America. My son is going there to negotiate to help the Biden family. When he comes back, and eight days later, the kid gets a billion dollars in his ridiculous private equity fund run by a recovering drug addict, somebody connected to the vice president of the United States and somebody connected to the biggest gangster in America. Wait a second. The son doesn't say to him, I got a billion dollars? By the way, you see what Joe said? It's contradicted by the son. The son said, I talked to my father about it. How about this? There was an article on December 9 of 2015 in ""The New York Times"" raising holy hell about Biden's son being on the board of the most corrupt company in Ukraine and how strange it looked. I don't know if Joe reads the newspapers, but somebody must have read that to him. And, finally, if Joe didn't know what his son was doing abroad, how may conflicts are there? This guy was flying blind? I don't know. Did he get money from Russia? Did he get money from Cuba? Was he doing business in Venezuela? You're telling me that the vice president of the United States was there for eight years. His son is going around the world taking millions from some adversary of the United States. ROBERTS: Yes. GIULIANI: Don't say yes. This is important. ROBERTS: No, no, we have -- I'm saying we have got to go. GIULIANI: This is about the only time I have gotten to point out a tremendously large scandal that affects the American people. And it's your job to do it, not just mine. I'm doing it to defend my client. ROBERTS: We are out of time. GIULIANI: But you're telling me that he had no system with his son to check on conflicts? So we know of two. We know there's a big conflict with Ukraine. We know there is a big conflict with China. Since Joe says and is apparently selling the swamp media on the fact that he didn't know, well, Joe, how many more conflicts are there? Venezuela? Cuba? ROBERTS: You have mentioned that. We have got to leave it. Mr. Mayor, we are... GIULIANI: One-point-five billion is enough for most people to get investigated. ROBERTS: We are out of time for this morning, but, clearly, we are going to keep looking into this. GIULIANI: And this is going to get bigger and bigger. And everything I say, I can prove. ROBERTS: Rudy, thanks so much for being with us. GIULIANI: Take me on. ROBERTS: All right. Appreciate it. Coming up, we will get reaction to the president's Iran policy with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Ben Cardin joins us here next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: Coming up, President Trump authorizes new economic penalties on Iran. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We have just sanctioned the Iranian national bank. It's going to be at the highest level of sanctions. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: We'll ask our Sunday panel whether the move will bring Tehran back to the negotiating table, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: As the United States boosts its defenses in the Middle East after blaming Iran for the attacks on Saudi oil facilities, the Islamic regime says it's ready for any scenario. Joining me here in Washington, Senator Ben Cardin, a top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator, welcome back to “Fox News Sunday.” SEN. BEN CARDIN, D-MD: John, it's great to be with you. Thank you. ROBERTS: So the U.S. is sending more troops and defensive weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to counter the threat coming from Iran. Your thoughts about sending more men and material there? CARDIN: John, this is a very dangerous situation. There could easily be a miscalculation. The temperature couldn't be harder between the United States and Iran. Our job is to isolate Iran. Iran is the bad actor. And what the president needs to do is get an international coalition to continue to work against Iran's support of terrorism. The challenge, of course, is, because, as the United States has been isolated when the president withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement. So we're having difficulty with our European allies to get the type of support we need, but we have to isolate Iran. ROBERTS: There are reports that -- from the Houthis apparently to Saudi Arabia and to the United States, I don't know if you saw my question to the secretary of state, that Iran is planning another attack in Saudi Arabia. If Iran were, in the middle of all of this, launch another attack at Saudi Arabia, would that demand a military response? CARDIN: There's really not a military solution to the problem of Iran. We need to make diplomacy work. Clearly there could be a miscalculation. We have to defend ourselves, no question about that, but we have to reduce the temp -- where we are, where we could have this miscalculation. It would be disastrous if we got into a fighting war in Iran. It will have consequences throughout the entire region. It's not in our national security interests. ROBERTS: All right, so we've got the United States ramping up sanctions on Iran, withdrawing from the JCPOA, which you yourself didn't -- didn't vote for. And Iran is countering by shooting down American drones, firing missiles and launching drones at Saudi oil facilities. I mean they are in a shooting war. So is -- is this -- is this -- I mean if you let somebody fire at you and you don't shoot back, are you not showing weakness? CARDIN: Well, John, here -- here's the fault of the Trump policies. Before we withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreements, there were conversations with the Europeans about strengthening the sanctions against Iran for the non- nuclear violations. We could have had that international support and tightens the economic pressure against Iran, but still stay within the nuclear agreement. By pulling out of the nuclear agreement, it's the view of Europe that this is an American problem rather than an international problem. ROBERTS: But -- but you know the arguments, this president said, look, it covers the nuclear, but it -- there's a sunset clause to it of a decade, which isn't much when you look at, you know, the history of nuclear development. But it also does not do anything to reign in Iran's malign activities. I pointed out, you yourself did not vote for the JCPOA because you were worried about future uranium enrichment. So why stay in a bad deal? CARDIN: No, I agree with that analysis, but the way to fix it is to work with Europe, work with our partners to deal with the non-nuclear violations, strengths the sanctions against Iran on the non-nuclear side, make sure they stay in compliance with the nuclear obligations. They were in compliance with the nuclear obligations when the United States pulled out. The bottom line is, we made -- the -- we isolated the United States rather than isolating Iran, and Iran is the bad actor. There's no question about it. We don't know what they're going to do, but we certainly need the support of our international partners. ROBERTS: But how serious is Iran about the JCPOA? The United States pulled out. There is still five signatories to it, yet Iran is violating the agreement. CARDIN: Well, the issue is, Iran -- we don't know how Iran's calculating this, but we do know that the U.S. sanctions is having a major impact on their economy. So the benefits they thought they were going to get under the nuclear agreement, they're no longer getting. ROBERTS: Right. CARDIN: That's causing them to recalculate. ROBERTS: For the moment, President Trump says he's showing restraint about Iran. He's got people like Secretary Pompeo saying it's an act of war. Others are pointing fingers, like Mark Esper and Pompeo at Iran. The president saying, I'm going to sit back and wait and see how this plays out. Listen to what he said in the Oval Office the other day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: I think the strong person's approach and the thing that does show strength would be showing a little bit of restraint. Much easier to do it the -- the other way. It's much easier. And Iran knows, if they misbehave, they're on borrowed time. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: So you've got the president's aides on the one hand saying, act of war, Iran's responsible. The president saying, I'm waiting and seeing her. He's leaving the door open to negotiation, even amidst all this tough talk. Could that be a good strategy to try to bring them to the table? CARDIN: I think it's an important week with all the world leaders -- most of the world leaders meeting up in New York for the opening of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I hope that we can get that type of unity with the international community in regards to Iran so that the military option is not the right option. I agree with Secretary Pompeo that diplomacy should be the way we proceed. I agree with that. And hopefully this week we can get the type of support in New York to make a difference in the calculation by Iran so that they stop these horrible things. What they're doing is horrible. We can't let them continue to do that. ROBERTS: Let me switch to this intelligence committee inspector general whistle-blower report. ""The Wall Street Journal"" reported on Friday that the president had a conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, in which he about eight times pressured Zelensky to have Ukraine work with Rudy Giuliani to look into Joe Biden. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said today, quote, I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure. So you have Democrats on the one side calling for the president's impeachment over this, and then you have the Ukrainian foreign minister saying, I don't see any pressure. CARDIN: I think we need to know what happened. The allegations are that the president used the power of his office for partisan political purposes, jeopardizing the national security of the United States by withholding aid to Ukraine, one of our key, strategic partners. That -- ROBERTS: Nobody's made the connection about aid yet. We don't even know what this thing's about. CARDIN: We -- we -- at least there's been some reports that there was $250 million that were held up, ultimately was released -- ROBERTS: I think people have connected the dots, but I don't think we've got anything really to back that up. CARDIN: Well, that's what -- let's find out. Let's -- let's find -- let's have transparency here. We can easily find that out if information about those phone calls would be released and we could see exactly what's involved. But the president has chosen, at least to date, not to release that information. These are serious allegations. Let's find out. I -- I -- I don't want to reach a conclusion. I'm just suggesting to you that an allegation that the president used his political office for partisan reasons, jeopardizing our national security, we need to get to the facts. ROBERTS: Is there a case to be made to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's -- their involvement in Ukraine? Let's listen to what the president said and what Joe Biden said the other day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he is not giving to a certain country less a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. BIDEN: Not one single, credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion. Not one single one. And so I have no comment except the president should start to (INAUDIBLE). (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: Now, in fact, a lot of credible news organizations, including ""The New York Times,"" have been looking into this. Ken Vogel, who's the reporter who wrote about it -- and here's the article -- back in May said on Friday that there's -- this could be a significant issue for Joe Biden and that there's more there. CARDIN: Well -- well, John, I know what happened in 2015 with the prosecutor. The international community needed that prosecutor to leave. Congress wanted that prosecutor to leave. Corruption was the center problem we had with Ukraine, maintaining our coalition against Russia for -- with sanctions. And we had to deal with the corrupt issues and the prosecutor was in the center of that. So that -- that was a policy that we wanted to implement. Joe Biden's issue has been looked at for a long time. There's been findings that there is no improper involvement. This is a distraction by the president of the United States to distract from his most recent situation. ROBERTS: You don't want to prejudge the situation with the president and his whistle-blower, but a lot of your Democratic colleagues are already making the leap to impeachment. Is that going too far? CARDIN: I -- I think you need to get the facts. I don't think you should -- you know, the impeachment process is a way in which Congress exercises its responsibility, checks and balances in our system. But you can't act on that type of a remedy until you have the facts. So let's get the facts first. ROBERTS: Senator Cardin, always good to see you. CARDIN: Nice to be with you. ROBERTS: Thanks so much for coming in. Coming up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the prospects of a showdown between the United States and Iran. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: I think it's abundantly clear and there is an enormous consensus in the region that we know precisely who conducted these attacks. It was Iran. NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What would be the consequence of an American or a Saudi military strike on Iran now? MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: An all-out war. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: The top diplomats from this country and Iran in a war of words this week over the fallout from the attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil industry. And its time now for our Sunday group. Jonah Goldberg for ""The National Review,"" Fox News political analyst Juan Williams, Susan Page of ""USA Today,"" and Matthew Continetti, founding editor of ""The Washington Free Beacon."" Are we going to war, Susan, with Iran? SUSAN PAGE, ""USA TODAY"": Well, judging from your interview with Secretary of State Pompeo, I'd say probably not. He -- you asked them if it's an active war, does that demand a military response, and he repeatedly denied -- declined to say yes. And judging from what the president did in June, after the American drone was shot down and he backed away from a military strike, I think the odds are against us taking military action in this case. ROBERTS: The fact that he backed away from that strike, does that mean that he cannot take military action? MATTHEW CONTINETTI, ""WASHINGTON FREE BEACON"": No. I mean he could take military action at any time. He's the commander-in-chief. What we're seeing, though, is that the maximum pressure campaign of the Trump administration has met maximum resistance from the Iranian regime. And the cyber operations and the economic warfare that the Trump White House has been waging against Iran has yet to deter them from their malign behavior in the region. But, that status quo is something I think the president prefers to all-out war. ROBERTS: Right. It -- the -- Congress is saying he's got to come to Congress for an authorization to use military force against Iran. First of all, does he have to? And if he went to Congress, would he get it? JONAH GOLDBERG, ""NATIONAL REVIEW"": It depends. I think we would need more provocation than what we have seen. I'm sort of a purist on this kind of stuff. I do think that you should go to Congress, unless it's in response to an immediate and urgent national security thing, then it -- Congress has the -- has the sole authority to authorize war. But we've seen that eroded so much over the last 50 years, like so many other congressional prerogatives that I think it's anybody's guess. JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: I think, John, based on your question, you can tell there's no clear end game in sight. What we know is the president says he doesn't want war there, but he's previously also said we're locked and loaded. And what was incredible to me was to hear him say that he's waiting for guidance to come from the Saudis. Now, the Iranians are no friends of ours, but, gosh, the Saudis, I don't know if they're a reliable and trustworthy regime. They kill American journalists. 9/11 is not to be forgotten. ROBERTS: And here's another argument that people made. The United States has sold Saudi Arabia, and the president made a big deal of this, billions of dollars in military equipment. Can't the Saudis handle this themselves? PAGE: And -- well, I guess we're going to find out. I mean we're making this gesture to Saudi Arabia with a very limited deployment. But -- but, yes, Saudi Arabia has a lot of defensive abilities, a lot of it provided by the United States, helped by the United States. WILLIAMS: But I think the key point here is, Iran has denied responsibility, but we have no reason to trust that they are not responsible, or at least supporting the Houthi rebels that did this. But the point from the American political perspective is, we are still trying to get out of Afghanistan. There is no appetite in his country for starting another war without a clear end game in sight. And the president has not provided that. CONTINETTI: And the president's policy, it reflects exactly that attitude though. WILLIAMS: Right. We all know what we're doing (ph). PAGE: And the president's base doesn't back it either (ph). CONTINETTI: He doesn't want to get involved either. What's remarkable here, for 70 years plus, the United States has guaranteed the free flow of oil from the Persian Gulf. That is ending. At its ending because of fracking. ROBERTS: Let's get on to the whistle-blower issue here. President Trump, he was leaving for Houston a short time ago. He said this about his conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of the Ukraine, back on July 25th. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: The conversation I had with the president of Ukraine was absolutely perfect. And people better find out who these people are that are trying to subvert our country, because here we go again. These are bad people. But the conversation I had with the president of Ukraine was absolutely a ten. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: So it was a ten. Is there anything wrong with the president saying to the president of the Ukraine, look, why don't you work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate what ties Joe Biden and Hunter Biden have to Ukrainian natural gas companies. PAGE: Yes. It's soliciting foreign help in your campaign for re-election for president of the United States. And it's something that I think people would generally find alarming. ROBERTS: Now, the Ukraine helped Hillary Clinton, so -- GOLDBERG: Yes, OK, look, I mean we've got to separate a whole bunch of things here. The idea -- you know, people who are -- you know, President Trump has -- has some weird messaging on this. On the one hand he says it's all made up and fake news. On the other hand he says he was spied on, which would suggest that, in fact, the allegations are true. Rudy Giuliani comes on air today and take great umbrage at the accusation or insinuation that he's a political hit man, and then he spends the next seven minutes like the -- one of the biggest political hit men I've ever seen. It could be -- I don't -- I think there's a lot of smoke and -- and bluster going on in what Giuliani is doing. It could all be true. If the president of the United States tried to bend national security, based upon his own partisan self-interest, that would be very, very, very bad. And the people who say he's just interested in corruption, this seems to be the only corruption case in the world he's concerned about, is the one about the guy who's beating him by ten points in the polls. ROBERTS: ""The Washington Examiner"" had an article this morning that suggested that the whistle-blower does not have firsthand knowledge of any of this. But the point is, is that if you're going to investigate the president, and there are 9,573 investigations of the president going on right now, should you not also investigate the person who might become president? CONTINETTI: A lot of conversations in Washington over the last 48 hours have begun with the word ""if."" And the fact is, we don't know. And so I think the advocates of impeachment in this case carry a heavy burden, John. One is that with the Russian investigation, there was a whole lot of misreporting and factual inaccuracy in the actual reporting. Two, when the Mueller report came out, it did not provide the data that Democrats wanted to impeach. And, third, all of these charges, as illustrated in Rudy Giuliani's interview with you, have the potential to boomerang on the Democratic Party. ROBERTS: All right, so let me ask you about the Democratic Party, Juan. You heard Ben Cardin say he doesn't want to prejudge anything. He wants the information. He wants to see this. You've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. You've got Elizabeth Warren. You've got a myriad of other Democrats not even waiting for a shred of evidence here. They're looking at reporting and saying, impeach him, off with his head. I mean should they not wait -- do they not have a responsibility to wait until we know some facts here before we got down the impeachment road? WILLIAMS: Yes, I think everyone should wait. But, remember, there's no reason to wait on the transcript. If, as the president describes it, nothing untoward took place, why is it that the administration is making such an effort to obstruct the Congress from getting that transcript? What we know is -- ROBERTS: It's not the transcript that they're not holding back -- WILLIAMS: Well -- ROBERTS: It's the complaint. WILLIAMS: Well, the complaint, the transcript, the whole thing. If -- because the transcript goes beyond the complaint, which is why I said transcript. But the idea is that this administration has, through the Justice Department, stop what is the law. The law says that if you have an urgent complaint, the inspector general of the director of national intelligence would transfer that to the Congress. It's not going on. That is wrong. GOLDBERG: Previous presidents have also disputed the idea that the president has an obligation by the -- by statute to do that. It's a -- it's a murky constitutional issue. PAGE: The one Democrat we haven't heard from calling for impeachment is the one Democrat who counts, Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She set a standard that we need to hear Republicans be outraged by the president's behavior, not just Democrats. And so far we haven't heard that. ROBERTS: Fifteen seconds. CONTINETTI: We'll be waiting for a long time. ROBERTS: Yes, Fifteen seconds, should the transcript be released? WILLIAMS: Of course. CONTINETTI: I think if it exculpates Trump, they should release it. But there is the issue of executive privilege here, governing foreign communications, which also needs to be respected. WILLIAMS: If this was Obama, House Republicans would have -- ROBERTS: We've got to go. Thanks, Juan. See you next Sunday, by the way. Coming up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" Denzel Washington and the club he says made him the man he is today. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: For many children, the hours between three and 8:00 p.m. are when their futures are decided. As Chris Wallace reported last fall, one organization has opened its doors for over 100 years to make sure that kids have a place to go after school and stay out of trouble. One of those kids became a household name, and he is our ""Power Player of the Week."" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DENZEL WASHINGTON, BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS NATIONAL SPOKESMAN: It's where I learned so many life lessons, just thinking I was having fun. CHRIS WALLACE, HOST (voice over): Denzel Washington is talking with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Four thousand local clubs that provide after-school programs for more than 4 million young people. And, in the process, change lives. He was in Washington last fall for the group's annual dinner. WASHINGTON: I remember that first day and how I felt and how special they made me feel. WALLACE: And to honor the national youth of the year. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Malachi Haynes. WALLACE: Malachi Haynes of Colorado, who's been going to his club since he was six. MALACHI HAYNES, BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB 2018 YOUTH OF THE YEAR: Being a leader and a role model in my community is my purpose. WASHINGTON: I was a wild one. You know, I was -- I had a lot of energy. WALLACE: Washington used to run track for his club. And he remembers when a new kid came in and started running faster. One of his mentors took him aside. WASHINGTON: He said, he has natural ability, but his natural ability will only take him so far. So I applied that to -- to -- to my career, my first two years when I started acting in college. WALLACE: Washington won the first of his two Oscars for his role in ""Glory,"" about an African-American military unit in the Civil War. For more than 30 years, he's played a series of indelible characters. WASHINGTON: To protect the sheep, you've got to catch the wolf. And it takes a wolf to catch a wolf, you understand? I was never interested in being a movie star. We were sort of New York theater snobs. I wanted to be James Earl Jones, you know? I was hoping to make $650 on Broadway one day. And -- and I did. WALLACE (on camera): Your father was a preacher and I've read that at various points in your life you've thought about becoming a preacher. WASHINGTON: Uh-huh. WALLACE: Really? WASHINGTON: It was prophesies that I would preach. And -- by this woman. And I said, well, maybe that's what I'm supposed to do. And says, well, you already have a pulpit. WALLACE (voice over): Now, Washington is more about giving back. WASHINGTON: You never see a U-Haul behind a hearse. That's what my pastor told me. You know, you -- whatever you have, you can't take it with you. So the question is, what are you going to do with what you have while you're here? WALLACE (voice over): The Boys & Girls Clubs deal with the ups and downs of life too. Kids at the clubs do better at school, are less likely to do drugs, and volunteer more. Malachi started his own program to improve reading levels. HAYNES: We call it Double Trouble. So we do an hour of reading, then an hour of playing basketball, eating pizza, just hanging out and getting to know the kids. WALLACE: And Denzel Washington says that's the real message here. WASHINGTON: We're just bombarded so much with negative news that the -- one can just feel like, well, what's the -- what's the use? But listening to these young people saying, oh, no, no, we're going to change it, we're going to do something about it, I'm -- that's inspiring. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: Chris asked Washington where he sees himself at this stage of his career. He says he uses stuntmen more than he used to but is excited about the unknown and what comes next in his life and career. And that's it for today. Chris is back again next weekend.

"The Deep State tried to use an illegitimate tool to throw up a smokescreen to distract the American people from President Trump's success, says former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. Republicans in  Congress  defended  President Trump  on Friday after a report said a ""whistleblower"" filed a complaint over an apparent July phone call between the president and the leader of Ukraine, blasting the allegations as ""highly partisan."" “It’s not like we haven’t seen this movie before,"" U.S. Rep.  Jim Jordan , R-Ohio, told the Washington Post. ""Democrats come out, they’re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out -- Whoa, different story! “This seems to be the same kind of deal,"" Jordan added. “It’s not like we haven’t seen this movie before. Democrats come out, they’re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out -- Whoa, different story!"" WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM The complaint made by an unnamed intelligence official, reportedly involved Trump asking Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son for alleged wrongdoing while the elder Biden was vice president. U.S. Rep.  Mark Meadows , R-N.C., echoed the idea that such complaints hamper the president in his work. “It would have a real chilling effect on dialogue between important leaders if they think that every time someone who overhears a conversation that wasn’t even party to the conversation is going to file a whistleblower complaint and it’ll end up on the front page of periodicals across the country,” Meadows said, according to The Post. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., said private phone calls with foreign leaders are part of the president’s job. “The fact is, the president, to quote John Marshall, is the ‘sole organ’ of U.S. external relations and has to have conversations in confidence with foreign leaders,"" he said. “There’s no practical way to conduct diplomacy without it.” “The fact is, the president ... has to have conversations in confidence with foreign leaders. There’s no practical way to conduct diplomacy without it.” But he added he’s in favor of transparency. The administration is also taking flak for not sharing the complaint with Congress. Most Republicans avoided commenting on the complaint, and while a few did express concerns, they were limited. Rep. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., said it would be “wildly inappropriate” for a president to ask a foreign government to get involved in a U.S. election, but added he isn’t accusing Trump of doing that. Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, broke with Republicans in saying some on his side of the aisle might join Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., in subpoenaing the president's phone records. “It’s certainly on the table,” he said. “When I say that I want to protect congressional oversight, I really mean that.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump has denied any impropriety and in a Twitter message Friday, he called the unidentified whistleblower ""highly partisan,"" The  Post  reported."

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set to meet with House Democrats as President Trump defends handling of Ukraine aid; insight from Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, Democrat from Michigan. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich. told Fox News Tuesday that she supports an impeachment investigation of  President Trump  over  events surrounding a phone call  involving the president of Ukraine because ""we cannot be divided on following the rule of law."" FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AMID BOMBSHELL REPORTS TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE AID A growing number of  House Democrats have supported an impeachment probe  against Trump after it was revealed that the administration froze $400 million in aid to Ukraine shortly before the president allegedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The president said Tuesday that he would release an unredacted transcript of the phone call. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CLAIMS UKRAINE AID WAS STALLED OVER CORRUPTION CONCERNS, DECRIES MEDIA ‘FRENZY’ Dingell told  Fox News’ ""Outnumbered Overtime”  that if Trump did not make investigating Biden a condition of releasing the aid, then why did the White House block it being provided to the two intelligence committees?” 
 “Now we get information that the Inspector General for Homeland Security determined that there was a real credible threat to our national security,” she added. Dingell's endorsement of an impeachment inquiry marks a change for the third-term congresswoman. In March, she told "" Fox News Sunday "" that "" I do not think an impeachment should ever be a partisan event. I think we need to have Republicans and Democrats or it will tear this country apart. It's a very serious movement."" Administration sources told Fox News that the freeze on Ukrainian aid was tied to concerns about corruption. Those sources said that Trump wanted to be confident that the incoming Zelensky administration was going to take steps to end corruption before releasing the funding. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sources tell Fox News that the aid was released last month after Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, called Trump and urged him to do so. Fox News' John Roberts, Brooke Singman contributed to this report."
"Then along came Donald Trump, who gave both prominent jobs.  And last week, former White House Press Secretary Spicer was twirling in a lime-green ruffled shirt, dancing with the stars. And former Trump campaign manager Lewandowski, defiant in a red tie and jacket, was tangling with and frustrating the House Judiciary Committee's Democrats in a hearing that many could only label absurd.   Spicer's much-hyped re-emergence was not okay, wrote  Anushay Hossain , and she wasn't referring to his dance moves.  ""Sean Spicer's entire claim to fame (or infamy) comes from lying for a president who uses his office to lie, to side with dictators, to defend men who abuse women and work for him, to separate families, to stand up for white nationalism and much, much worse.  Spicer lied for a liar for a living. ""  Lewandowski, who's considering a run for a US Senate seat in New Hampshire, got an equally bad review from legal analyst  Elie Honig : "" Lewandowski was a truly horrible witness.  His demeanor was the stuff of a trial lawyer's nightmares. He was angry, combative, sarcastic, and more intent on getting off personal insults and pumping up his impending Senate campaign than actually answering questions or getting Congress or the public any closer to truth.""  Writing about the Lewandowski hearing in the Washington Post,  Harry Litman  warned, ""We may have just gotten a living glimpse of the way President Trump will continue  to distort and darken our politics long after he himself has left the scene ."" Then there's Rudy Giuliani.  The former New York City mayor actually had a national reputation before his immersion in Trumpworld, but has added a new cast to it. In a contentious interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo about an intelligence whistleblower allegation, wrote  Michael D'Antonio , "" Trump's personal lawyer and TV attack dog...both denied and confirmed  that the controversy may have to do with the fact that Giuliani has urged Ukrainian officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden."" (There's no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.) In a July call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump repeatedly suggested working with Giuliani on such an investigation, according to the Wall Street Journal. Zelensky may have a lot to gain from good relations with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. That, wrote  David Andelman , raises a ""key question: will Ukraine's new president calculate that he can win big points with the Kremlin  by giving a little help to Trump, Giuliani and their campaign  from more than 5,000 miles away?"" The Ukraine matter seemed to be at the heart of the striking new fissure in Trump's relationship with intelligence agencies.  Frida Ghitis  asked, ""What exactly could President Donald Trump have done that...drove a US intelligence official to file a formal whistleblower complaint over communications between Trump and an unidentified foreign leader...?""  She added, ""we have encountered another secret in a presidency that has been defined by obfuscation and falsehoods...  what is Trump hiding? ""  This could be seen as a warning to Trump's 2020 political rivals. In fact, Democrats should be ready for a race unlike anything they've seen before, wrote  Julian Zelizer . Now, ""Trump has the power of the presidency behind him. With that power comes  the potential for the administration to unleash damaging investigations  in the middle of the campaign that will put the Democrats on defense.""   The A team is long gone Now that generals James Mattis, John Kelly and H.R. McMaster have left the administration, along with CEOs Gary Cohn and Rex Tillerson, the President has ""surrounded himself with yes-men and is running his Cabinet like he used to run his real estate company --  as a one-man show surrounded by flunkies ,"" wrote  Peter Bergen . Trump's selection of Robert O'Brien, the State Department's chief hostage negotiator, as national security adviser last week fits right in, Bergen observed.  One of the first things on O'Brien's agenda is how to respond to the attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, which the Trump administration blamed on Iran.  Trump and his team have said many times that the President was willing to meet with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani with no preconditions -- but last Sunday Trump tweeted that was ""fake news."" It must be ""amnesia,"" Bergen noted. "" Trump's posturing back and forth between aggression and conciliation  might work for a real estate deal in Manhattan, but it's quite confusing and the stakes are also much higher when you are dealing with the complex calculations of a major regional power such as Iran.""

One of them, 19-year-old  Katie Eder  wrote, ""we're striking for a Green New Deal; for the immediate cessation of fossil-fuel projects on sovereign indigenous land; for environmental justice; for the protection and restoration of nature; and for sustainable agriculture. We're striking for ourselves, for our friends and family, for the kid who lives down the street from us.  We're striking because it's what we have to do. "" Good for them, wrote  David Gergen  and  James Piltch . Like the Parkland students and the civil rights protesters of the 1960s, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is leading a movement of conscience, one that contrasts with the do-nothing attitudes of many of their elders. ""At least once before, a children's movement was a core inspiration for our country to address its greatest injustices,"" Gergen and Piltch wrote.  ""Today, the young speak with moral clarity again."" Kavanaugh redux The controversy over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh resurfaced in a big way with the publication of a piece in the New York Times opinion section drawing on a new book by two of the newspaper's reporters. There was something for all sides to focus on.  The book,  Jill Filipovic  wrote, ""explores and corroborates previously under-reported claims by Kavanaugh's Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez that when she was a student, Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face as a joke. According to news reports, the FBI never fully investigated her claims, nor interviewed the people who reached out to them to corroborate. Thanks to constraints put in place by the White House, sources told CNN, the FBI also never interviewed Christine Blasey Ford, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, nor Kavanaugh himself.  The 'investigation' was a sham, and the Trump administration made it that way .""  The Times came in for withering criticism for its handling of the piece, since -- while it described an additional allegation against Kavanaugh -- it failed to point out that the woman allegedly involved did not remember the incident, according to her friends, and declined to speak to reporters (The Times added an editor's note with those points after the piece was originally published). The Washington Post's  Kathleen Parker  wrote, ""The recent fiasco at the New York Times, which last weekend published the latest uncorroborated sexual assault accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh,  was a monument to hearsay and a travesty of journalistic ethics. "" Also in the Post,  Marc Thiessen  welcomed the call by some Democrats to impeach Kavanaugh: ""As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose. In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Brett Kavanaugh or liberal court packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should.  So, let the impeachment proceedings begin ."" Elie Honig  blasted President Trump's tweet urging the Justice Department to ""rescue"" Kavanaugh from the allegations. That's definitely not its role, wrote Honig. Still, the calls for impeachment are futile: "" Kavanaugh almost certainly is not going anywhere ... He likely will sit on the Supreme Court for decades to come, certainly for as long as he wishes. But Kavanaugh's deeply flawed confirmation process should stand as a reminder of the danger of turning the Justice Department, long fearless and proudly independent, into an institutional political operative."" The short SNL career of Shane Gillis Days after Saturday Night Live announced that comedian Shane Gillis would be joining its cast, the show fired him for what it called his past ""offensive, hurtful and unacceptable"" remarks. Presidential candidate  Andrew Yang  had waded into the controversy, saying that it would be a mistake to dismiss Gillis for his 2018 podcast comments, which included anti-Asian slurs.  Dean Obeidallah  applauded Yang's suggestion of ""a more nuanced approach that offered the hope that people like Gillis can evolve."" Obeidallah, a former comedian and SNL staffer, wrote,  ""We should encourage and incentivize people to improve, instead of ensuring that they remain ignorant and hateful.""  Comedian  Judy Gold  thought SNL's call was sensible: ""Shane Gillis has every right to say whatever he wants -- that's what is so great about this country and the First Amendment. But let's get a few things straight. The clip wasn't exactly dug up; it's not old, it's from last year.  The clip is not funny, because it's not comedy.  It's a guy who happens to be a stand-up comic blathering with his friend, Matt McCusker, who also happens to be a stand-up comic, as they sit in front of microphones gratuitously spewing epithets and making lazy 'jokes' about other races, sexual orientations and gender without any real context or substance.""  An 'imposter'? In the midst of a challenging election campaign, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had to try to explain why he wore brownface or blackface at least three times. Amid his apologies, he admitted he didn't know how many times he had darkened his skin. ""Canada's elections take place on October 21, and it's looking like a tough race,"" wrote  Michael Bociurkiw . ""Any perception of being insensitive or hypocritical-- as an 'imposter,' in the words of one major Canadian newsmagazine earlier this year --  is certainly not the way Trudeau wants to be seen. Janaya Khan  suggested that, for Trudeau, ""blackface is a mere obstacle to overcome in his campaign run after receiving rebukes this week for darkening his face several times in the past. But for the millions of black, Indigenous and other people of color in Canada, this is far more than a simple scandal. Blackface is a reminder that people of color are  still considered to be 'characters' instead of equal and full human beings."" Be nice to the coral reefs The storms that have devastated the Bahamas are a reminder of the fragility of coastlines. Marine scientist  Michael Beck  wrote that endangered coral reefs are much more than a tourist attraction. They ""act as submerged breakwaters, they 'break' waves and protect communities and wetlands that further block waves and storm surge. ...coral reefs dampen more than 97% of waves before they reach coastlines. Losing just one meter from the top of a reef allows an exponential increase in the wave energy that passes through to the shore. This would lead to a doubling in the cost of flooding during storms for coral reef coastlines in more than 60 countries around the world."" Beck noted, ""Storms have shaped our shorelines for millennia, and for most of that time our reefs and wetlands  stood as guardians against those storms. Without them, we have only ourselves .""

But one suggestion last week seemed to unite America: a studio executive's mention of the possibility the 1987 classic film ""Princess Bride"" could be remade. It prompted a ""mass, multi-generational consensus going,""NOOOOOOOO!""-- exploding across social media like a neutron bomb over the offhand implication ... that somebody somewhere is thinking of"" a remake. The film is, "" if not perfect, darned near inimitable.  It rewards re-viewing as few others of its era, with (William) Goldman dialogue that you thought you'd forgotten from the last several dozen viewings.""  Breena Kerr  was in the audience for the opening weekend of the Jennifer Lopez movie, ""Hustlers"". She loved it. ""It has the same timeless appeal of Robin Hood, except here, Robin Hood works in a strip club, stealing from Wall Street sharks and giving to, well, herself.""  Kerr talked to real-life strippers about the film, who noted the film's success with viewers at the box office and wondered: why ""don't they get more support for the work they choose to do in our capitalist world?"" Some weren't thrilled to see strippers portrayed as criminals, ""pointing out that those who do this work are doing work, period --  they're putting on a show because it's their job. """
"'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani hitting the weekend shows to continue pushing the Biden-Ukraine controversy. In Donald Trump’s view, the best way to neutralize a scandal is with a good counter-scandal. We saw this throughout the Russia investigation, when the president countered the allegations of obstruction with a crusade against a witch hunt, Deep State conspiracy and fake news. Trump is doing it again with the media and political furor over his phone call with Ukraine’s leader, trying to shift the spotlight to questionable conduct by Joe Biden and his son. And early indications are that it’s working. BOLTON, NEOCONS HIT TRUMP FOR NOT STRIKING IRAN Philippe Reines, the former State Department official and longtime Hillary Clinton confidant, said on “Media Buzz” that after the first round of political combat over Ukraine, Trump is the winner. Whether that’s true or not, calling out Biden is very much the focus of the president’s counterattack against allegations that have reignited Democratic talk of impeachment. Rudy Giuliani told me on Sunday that the political crisis is helping him accomplish what he’s been trying to do for five months, which is focus media scrutiny on the former vice president and Hunter Biden, who was paid big bucks by a Ukrainian gas giant that had come under investigation. Joe Biden has publicly bragged about pressuring Ukraine into firing its top prosecutor, who was overseeing the case—though it was not active at the time--by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees. Giuliani pushed the Biden story on my show last April, and many other programs as well. He has also met with Ukrainian officials in an attempt to revive the Biden probe there. (No investigation has found wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.) The president’s personal lawyer laid it out yesterday with Maria Bartiromo: “It’s the only way you can get this out. The only way they would cover this story is by punching the president in the face and then the president deflects the punch which he’s done, the story came down and then he hits with a right hand that’s more powerful.” SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES And that, in turn, is producing stories like this one the other day in the  Washington Post: “Suddenly, Biden faced two dueling realities: The president he is hoping to defeat next year — and who he describes as morally unfit for office — is under scrutiny for behavior some view as treasonous. But the story is inextricably linked to Biden’s son, pushing one of the topics that Biden is least comfortable discussing into the spotlight.” The fact is it’s impossible to cover the furor over the Trump call without delving into the details of what at the least is Biden’s son trading on his name (as political relatives have done in every administration). Trump bristled at Ukraine questions yesterday at the U.N., telling reporters they are ""a fake news group of people...If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they'd be getting the eletric chair right now."" At a time when longshot GOP rival Bill Weld is accusing him of treason, the president did not explain why Biden's actions would result in a death penalty case. Those comments followed Trump telling reporters on Sunday that what the Wall Street Journal and others had reported about the July call was essentially true, though he insists it was totally appropriate: “The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine. And Ukraine, Ukraine’s got a lot of problems.” So Trump is being accused of the same thing he’s saying Biden did in 2015, pressuring Ukraine for partisan reasons. The administration has been holding up $250 in military aid to help Ukraine fight Russian separatists. Trump says he never brought up the aid, but he didn’t have to—it’s hanging in the air. The president said he’d “love” to release a transcript of the call with Volodymyr Zelensky, but has to figure out how to do so. By the way, Trump was wrong when he recently tweeted that the media “want to stay as far away as possible” from the Biden allegations. A quick search found many major stories on the matter, including: New York Times, 2015: “Joe Biden, His Son and the Case Against a Ukrainian Oligarch” Washington Post, 2019: “As Vice President, Biden Said Ukraine Should Increase Gas Production. Then His Son Got a Job with a Ukrainian Gas Company.” New Yorker, 2019: “Will Hunter Biden Jeopardize His Father’s Campaign?” Joe Biden, for his part, angrily accused Trump over the weekend of abusing his power in an attempt to “smear” him because he knows “I’ll beat him like a drum.” Biden said he never discussed overseas business dealings with his son, which prompted Trump to call him a liar. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker they briefly discussed it once. The more the story devolves into a partisan back-and-forth, the more it neutralizes the political danger to the president. That was the playbook against Bob Mueller. Nancy Pelosi is under growing pressure from some previously impeachment-wary Democrats to drop her opposition in light of Ukraine. She is holding the line for now while warning the White House that failure to turn over key documents could prove the tipping point. But Trump can easily survive—again—if he turns this into another two-sided scandal, filled with interminable details and unpronounceable names, that most Americans can’t follow."
"A look at who can be impeached and how the proceedings move forward House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., on Tuesday announced the launch of an official impeachment inquiry into  President Trump . This, amid an increasing clamor over a whistleblower’s complaint that Trump may have sought the help of a foreign government in his bid for reelection. The  announcement of the inquiry  marked early concrete steps by Congress, as some Dems call for his removal from office. But the full impeachment process, by design, is a long and multifaceted affair, not undertaken lightly. It could require months – and a great deal of political capital and partisan infighting – to run its course.  PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP Here is how impeachment proceedings are launched and what it would take to actually remove a president from office. How it works: The framers of the Constitution established impeachment as a way to hold a president accountable for abuses of power. The Constitution lays out some specific actions – think treason, or bribery – that would lead to impeachment and removal from office, and affords the president a trial to determine whether or not he's guilty.  Along with treason and bribery, the president can be accused of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” That's a rather vague term borrowed, as is so much of the language on impeachment, from British common law dating back to the 14th century. The term “high crimes and misdemeanors” was controversial when George Mason inserted it as a provision in the Constitution in 1787 and the phrase has confounded lawmakers and constitutional scholars ever since. While what makes an offense impeachable is debatable, the process for impeaching a president and removing him from office is fairly straightforward, albeit lengthy. Pelosi’s announcement of an impeachment inquiry from the House committees does not mean that the lower chamber of Congress will actually take up a resolution to impeach Trump – just that there's a plan to probe the whistleblower’s complaint surrounding the president’s phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. If lawmakers in the Democratically controlled House decide, however, to move forward with impeachment proceedings, the first step would be for a member of the lower body to introduce a resolution to impeach Trump. During the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s, the House didn’t even get this far; President Richard Nixon, facing mounting pressure from lawmakers and extreme unpopularity among the American public, resigned. REP. AL GREEN WARNS DEMS: 'THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO TURN ON US' IF WE DON'T IMPEACH TRUMP After introduction, Pelosi would have to direct House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., to hold a hearing to decide if the resolution will be put to a vote by the full chamber. Nadler would need only a simple majority in the committee to send the resolution to the House floor for a full vote. Simple majorities On the floor, all that is needed to actually impeach the president is another simple majority vote by those lawmakers present and voting. This is what happened to President Bill Clinton in 1998, when he was impeached by the House on the charges of lying under oath and obstruction of justice.  Clinton and Andrew Johnson are the only two American presidents to be impeached in the House. Misconception Just because a president is impeached, however, removal from the Oval Office is hardly a certainty. That is a matter to be decided during the president’s “trial” in the Senate. The trial is meant to decide whether the president has committed a crime; the procedure for the trial is set by Senate leadership. GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN During the trial, House lawmakers serve as so-called “managers,” who basically fill the role that prosecutors would in a criminal trial and present evidence against the president. The president is represented by his own counsel.  The chief justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial and the Senate acts as the jury – listening to the arguments from both sides before deliberating and voting on whether to remove the president from office. It takes a two-thirds vote to convict a president; with a finding of guilt, the president is removed from office and the vice president is sworn in to replace him.  How we got here:  Trump’s controversial conversation with the Ukrainian president is not the first time that the idea of impeaching him has been mentioned. Indeed, the specter of impeachment has loomed over his presidency since before he ever took office. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and calls from Democrats that Trump obstructed justice. Multiple tries by Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, to bring forth articles of impeachment. Billionaire Tom Steyer’s Need to Impeach campaign. All that and more has clung to the Trump administration. But Pelosi’s announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry marks the first time the House speaker has yielded to the demands of fellow Democrats on the matter. Pelosi previously has been extremely reticent even to discuss impeachment – worried that it would hurt Democrats' chances of taking back the White House in 2020 – so her announcement on Tuesday marked a major shift. So, what led to the change? Despite the phone call with Ukraine’s Zelensky taking place this past July, the impetus for the current impeachment push actually goes back to June, when Trump said during an interview that he would consider accepting damaging information about a political opponent from a foreign government without first notifying the FBI.  ""I think you might want to listen, there isn't anything wrong with listening,"" Trump told ABC News. ""If somebody called from a country, Norway, [and said] 'we have information on your opponent' -- oh, I think I'd want to hear it."" FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED A few days later, the Defense Department announced $250 million in aid to Ukraine, but by mid-July Trump told acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on the disbursement, with administration officials declining to give lawmakers more information on the matter. A day after Mueller testified before Congress on his Russia probe, Trump conducted what he called a “routine” phone call with Zelensky, which prompted the whistleblower’s complaint that Trump pushed Ukraine's leader for help investigating former Vice President Joe Biden -- a Dem frontrunner in the 2020 election -- and Biden's son Hunter. Three days after the phone call, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats resigned and Trump named National Counterterrorism Center Director Joseph Maguire his acting DNI. On Aug. 12, the unnamed whistleblower filed a complaint to Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, who in turn passed it on to Maguire. The acting DNI, however, did not alert Congress within the one week allotted to report the complaint, which forced Atkinson to send a letter to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Ranking Member Devin Nunes. Schiff sent a formal letter on Sept. 10 asking for the complaint, but three days later, Maguire denied the request and Schiff issued a subpoena. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The news of the complaint emerged publicly last week, and while Trump originally tried to shift the focus toward his allegations against Biden, he ultimately acknowledged he discussed Biden during his call but deflected on whether he wanted any damaging information on the former vice president. ""The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump said.

           Good morning and welcome to  Fox News First .  Here's what you need to know as you start your day ... Fox News Exclusive: White House to release document showing intel community watchdog found whistleblower had 'political bias,' official says   
A senior Trump administration official told Fox News late Tuesday that the administration will release a document showing the intelligence community inspector general found the whistleblower who leveled an explosive accusation against President Trump concerning his talks with Ukraine  had “political bias” in favor of “a rival candidate” of the president . The official did not identify the name of the rival candidate. Separately, a senior administration official told Fox News the White House has been working as quickly as it can to release to Congress the whistleblower complaint involving President Trump's conversations with the leader of Ukraine, as long as it's legally possible. The news came just hours after  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry  by alleging that the administration was hiding the complaint. Other top Democrats had previously said such an inquiry was already underway. The senior administration official told Fox News that the White House had nothing to hide, that there has been no wrongdoing, and that the White House's general position has been that it will make everything possible available to Congress or the public regarding Trump's conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the complaint to the intelligence community's inspector general. A source familiar with the matter told Fox News this week that the  whistleblower had no firsthand knowledge of Trump's July call  with Zelensky. Trump vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of the call by Wednesday.  Click here for more on our top story. Giuliani, Republicans: Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry of Trump will backfire 
One of the biggest questions is  whether House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump will backfire . Democrats have suggested Trump, in his call with Zelensky, tried to convince the Ukraine government into investigating potential 2020 presidential election opponent Joe Biden, his son Hunter and the Biden family's business dealings. The president, Democrats have suggested, had $400 million in aid to Ukraine frozen to pressure officials into pursuing the Biden investigation. The Trump administration says the decision to freeze funding came more than a week before his call with Zelensky and that it was based on concerns about broader Ukraine corruption. The contents of the call, as well as the whistleblower complaint, could throw cold water on Democrats' explosive suggestions. A senior administration official told Fox News there are a “few words” in the transcript that will raise eyebrows, but it is nowhere near as inflammatory as Democrats have suggested. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption. Plus, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani -- who has long publicly called for Ukraine to investigate Biden's dealings in Ukraine -- posted a series of messages on Twitter suggesting Democrats have a bigger problem on their hands with corruption involving ""high level members of the Obama cabinet"" and ""multi-million and billion dollar pay-for-play."" ""Slimy Joe is not alone,"" Giuliani tweeted.  Click on the video above to see Giuliani's appearance on ""The Ingraham Angle.""

       Meanwhile, Trump is set to meet with Zelensky on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Wednesday. The visit was previously scheduled, unrelated to the whistleblower allegation, although the two leaders are expected to face questions about the matter from reporters.

A Republican congressman introduced a  resolution on Tuesday calling for the ouster of House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. , from his panel post for pursuing impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The proceedings were formally backed late Tuesday by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, said in a release that Nadler has acted against the will of the House of Representatives, which never gave his committee explicit authorization to begin impeachment proceedings. The body voted 332-95 in July to table an impeachment resolution from Rep. Al Green, D-Texas. Fox News Exclusive: Iran President Rouhani downplays chance of Trump UN meeting, says president took trust away from relationship 
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani all but closed the door on potentially meeting with President Trump this week, and blamed the commander-in-chief for damaging relations between the two countries, in an exclusive interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace on Tuesday. Rouhani, in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, was asked if there was any chance the two leaders would speak to each other this week. ""Why would we bump into one another?"" the Iranian leader told Wallace. ""If we seek to pursue higher goals to benefit both countries, both people, it must be planned, and talks must be based on those plans. But prior to that, we must create mutual trust and that is something that Mr. Trump took away from this framework."" Rouhani is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday.

Temporary workers have been the top request among union members , according to the Detroit Free Press. Temp workers are union members doing the same work as permanent employees but get half the pay and far fewer benefits. The union wants those workers to get a path to being permanent and as temps, get pay and benefits that more closely match their permanent counterparts.

"Warren beats out Biden as frontrunner; Peter Doocy reports. A slew of polls in recent days indicate the battle for the  2020 Democratic presidential nomination  is now a two-candidate face-off between former Vice President  Joe Biden  and Massachusetts Sen.  Elizabeth Warren , as Vermont Sen.  Bernie Sanders  slips to a distant third. WARREN EDGES BIDEN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL, GAINS GROUND IN NEVADA Warren – the populist senator who’s pushed out one progressive policy proposal after another – stands at 27 percent among Democratic voters and independents who lean Democratic in a  Quinnipiac University poll  released Wednesday morning, with the former vice president commanding 25 percent. Warren’s two-point edge is well within the survey’s margin of error. Warren has surged 8 percentage points since Quinnipiac’s previous national poll, which was conducted late last month, with Biden -- long considered the frontrunner in the race -- dropping seven points. Sanders, the independent populist longtime lawmaker who’s making his second straight White House bid, stands at 16 percent in the new survey, basically unchanged from last month. ""After trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,"" Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said. ""We now have a race with two candidates at the top of the field, and they’re leaving the rest of the pack behind."" Going beyond the poll’s topline numbers, Malloy noted that if you “dig a little deeper…the reasons behind Warren's rise become more clear. She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee. On top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes - even if it means things are harder along the way."" South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg stands at 7 percent in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent. Everyone else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders registered at 2 percent or less. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Many political analysts downplay the results of national polls, pointing to the fact the race for the presidential nomination is a battle for the states and their delegates to the parties' nominating conventions. But the Quinnipiac results follow similar findings in polls released the past couple of days in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, the first three states to vote in the presidential primary and caucus nominating calendar. Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire in a  Monmouth University survey  released Tuesday, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within that survey’s sampling error. Sanders is in third in the poll, at 12 percent. A couple of hours after the release of the Monmouth poll in New Hampshire, a new survey in Nevada, which holds its caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren. A  USA Today/Suffolk University survey  put Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent. And in Iowa, a  Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom  poll released this past weekend indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling. The release of the surveys come as  Warren’s campaign  on Tuesday announced they’re spending a whopping $10-million to run digital and TV ads over the next few months in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, which votes fourth in the nominating calendar and holds the first southern primary. WARREN DISHING OUT $10 MILLION TO RUN DIGITAL AND TV ADS IN ALL FOUR EARLY VOTING STATES The release of these new live telephone operator polls comes with just over four months to go until the first votes in Iowa. But that can be an eternity in campaign politics. Warren continues to downplay her surge in the surveys, telling reporters a few days ago that, “I don’t do polls. We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.” The pollsters agree. Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray noted that “it is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux.” The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted September 19-23, with 1,337 registered voters nationwide – including 561 self-described Democratic voters independents who lean towards the Democrats – questioned by telephone. The sampling error for the survey Democratic nomination questions is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points."
"The affair, centering on Trump's contacts with a leader of a mystery foreign nation -- identified in two reports as Ukraine -- has also injected a toxic element into relations among the President, the intelligence community and Congress. It is hard to see how any of this ends well. Six months after special counsel Robert Mueller shut up shop, the White House again faces suspicion over Trump's dealings with a foreign power and seems to be taking steps to stop the full story from coming out. Democrats are rummaging for new skeletons in Trump's closet and yet another showdown is developing between the executive and Congress that appears almost certain to play out in the courts. The details of the controversy unleashed  when a whistleblower sounded the alarm  about the President are complex, disputed according to political allegiance and largely not public. The Washington Post  and  The New York Times  reported Thursday that the contacts at issue between Trump and the foreign leader involve Ukraine. In the past, some of Trump's supporters, including his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, have urged the Kiev government to open investigations that the President could use to raise suspicions about his political rivals, including Joe Biden. In a  heated exchange with CNN's Chris Cuomo  on Thursday night, Giuliani denied asking Ukraine to investigate the former vice president, before admitting he had done just that. The US and Ukraine were in discussions about $250 million in military aid to Kiev this summer that had been delayed by the White House. Giuliani said he didn't know anything about the package, but that if Trump had used it as leverage to benefit himself politically in any way he would not have done anything wrong.  ""The reality is that the President of the United States, whoever he is, has every right to tell the president of another country you better straighten out the corruption in your country if you want me to give you a lot of money. If you're so damn corrupt that you can't investigate allegations -- our money is going to get squandered,"" Giuliani said.  T rump attempted to discredit the whistleblower as ""highly partisan"" in a series of tweets Friday morning, echoing remarks made by Giuliani on Thursday night. The President said his comments to ""a certain foreign leader"" were ""pitch perfect."" Trump tweeted: ""Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!"" Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. There is so far no public evidence that the whistleblower's complaint pertains to this conversation or that there was any abuse of power by Trump. The White House later lifted the hold on aid.  But the potential ramifications of this new storm are already becoming clear and the risks facing the President, the intelligence community and Democrats in Congress are climbing by the day. Disturbing possibilities There must at least be a possibility that Trump abused his power or committed a grievous ethical lapse in dealing with the foreign leader. His defense was not exactly reassuring, considering some of the wild comments the President has made in the company of rogue counterparts such as Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un. ""Is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call?"" Trump tweeted on Thursday. CNN reported Thursday  that the intelligence community inspector general suggested to the House Intelligence Committee that the complaint raised concerns about multiple actions. He would not say whether those instances involved   Trump, sources familiar with the closed-door briefing told CNN. The inspector general, Michael Atkinson, was legally unable to discuss the complaint itself, since Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has declined to hand it over. Democrats say he is compelled to provide the complaint under whistleblower legislation, and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said his committee may take legal action if it isn't turned over. The Washington Post on Wednesday  said the complaint referenced a ""promise"" Trump allegedly made to the unidentified leader. CNN has not confirmed that aspect of the controversy. The whistleblower didn't have direct knowledge of the communications, an official briefed on the matter told CNN. Instead, the whistleblower's concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration's determination that the complaint didn't fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said. It is hard to know the potential exposure faced by the President. But given the sensitivity of the issue, the complaint is likely to have come from an official familiar with the scope of presidential power. And it was signed off as ""urgent and credible"" by the inspector general -- a Trump appointee -- who thought Congress should know in line with whistleblowing laws. The implication of such a fact pattern is staggering and opens up the potential of serious misconduct inside the White House -- despite Trump's denials of any wrongdoing. A President maligned?  If, on the other hand, the alleged behavior by the President does not reach such a bar, the political fallout will be considerable. Trump, acting within his wide Article Two constitutional powers, may have been maligned and there will be accusations that the whistleblower -- though moving within the scope of the law -- will have overreached. The President's suspicion of the intelligence community, which he sees as a ""Deep State"" bent on overthrowing him, will grow. If a president cannot trust his own spies, and thinks they are working against him and not the country's enemies, then America's national security will be harmed. The President's allies are already arguing that the controversy is simply another ruse by House Democrats to damage Trump. ""He has very wide authority, really unchecked authority, to talk to world leaders about anything he deems appropriate as he is representing the United States of America,"" said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union.""If this were able to go forward, any staffer in an agency could constantly hobble a Democratic President, duly elected."" ""This is an unconstitutional argument,"" Schlapp said on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Of course, the White House could clear all this up by explaining the contents of the alleged contacts between the President and the foreign leader. But it is taking the opposite tack. According to three CNN sources , the White House and the Justice Department advised the director of national intelligence that the complaint isn't governed by laws covering intelligence whistleblowers. The revelation is the first known evidence of the White House's involvement in the standoff. There may be an argument that the content of the President's communications or an official's impressions of them sent to Congress are subject to executive privilege. But the administration's resistance to scrutiny is already fueling suspicions of a cover-up. And it throws new light on the role of Attorney General William Barr -- who has been accused by critics of shaping special counsel Robert Mueller's damning revelations to the President's advantage. Barr, who served in the same role for President George H.W. Bush, advocates a theory of expansive presidential power, one reason why he has become perhaps Trump's favorite Cabinet member. Whistleblowers exposed House Democrats argue that the White House is yet again adopting a model of presidential power that threatens to tear the checks and balances of the US system to shreds. Schiff effectively argued that the approach taken by the administration could lead to the quashing of whistleblower claims in the government. That could lead down a road of power without accountability and in theory impunity for any presidential wrongdoing. ""The impact of this opinion is that if the Department of Justice decides that any employee of the intelligence committee comes forward, follows the law, follows the process, is nonetheless outside the process, they're not protected,"" the California Democrat said. ""Which not only means this whistleblower is not protected, it means no whistleblower is protected. That is the danger of the DOJ's misinterpretation of the law."" The fresh confrontation between the White House and the Congress is certain to fuel the frustration of Democrats at the White House's efforts to evade scrutiny. And it will add momentum to claims of many grass roots liberals and a growing corps of House Democrats who do not share House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reluctance to proceed with impeachment."
"""He's just flat out too old,"" said conservative columnist and Fox News contributor  Byron York  highlighting a persistent criticism of former Vice President Joe Biden's candidacy. ""You have a candidate in Biden who is asking the American public that if re-elected he can serve in the White House until age 86...that is total unchartered territory in American history and I don't think it's going to happen,"" he argued on  Fox Nation 's latest episode of ""Wise Guys."" Biden, 76 joins President Donald Trump at 73 years old and Democratic  candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders I-Vt., at 78 as the oldest candidates in the 2020 presidential race. BIDEN'S AGE, MEMORY COME UNDER ATTACK AT DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ""I think we're going to see a gradual dissipation in energy by the Biden campaign until he is finally overtaken,"" York continued, saying ""the bigger issue is that Biden is a figure from the past."" York was joined by Fox News contributor and former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz R-Ut., who echoed his critique of the former vice president. BIDEN GAFFES, FITNESS FOR OFFICE COME UNDER FIRE IN NEW TRUMP CAMPAIGN VIDEO ""I've just never met anyone that said 'Please, Joe Biden, I want him to be president', and there's an enthusiasm gap that he suffers from. He just can't get people to a Biden rally,"" he said contrasting Biden's rally turnout to President Trump's significantly larger campaign crowds in 2016. ""Look at the way Trump did it... when he wasn't on top of the polls he would show up with a couple tweets -- I remember he showed up in Las Vegas with like 25,000 people showing up and you don't see that organically on the Democratic side.  You see it a little bit with Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren has one to two rallies, but not to the degree that Donald Trump does,"" he continued. JIMMY CARTER SAYS HE HOPES 'THERE'S AN AGE LIMIT FOR PRESIDENCY' IN APPARENT JAB AT BIDEN, SANDERS Biden’s been largely brushing off criticism that he’s too old for the Oval Office. Earlier this month, he told reporters he’ll prove his fitness through the grinding process that is the presidential campaign trail, and pledged to release his medical records when he gets his ""next physical” before the voting begins next February in the Iowa caucuses. Former President Jimmy Carter, 95, also weighed in on the issue, saying he couldn't have handled the presidency at 80 years old during his term as the 39th  U.S. president  from 1977 until 1981, when he was in his 50s. BRIT HUME CALLS BIDEN'S CONDITION 'WORRISOME' Speaking during his annual report at the Carter Center in  Atlanta ,  Ga. , last week, Carter said he hopes ""there's an age limit"" to serving in one of the most powerful positions in the world. “If I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don’t believe I could undertake the duties I experienced when I was president,"" he told the crowd.

"According to the Post, a whistleblower complaint stemming from Trump's July phone conversation with the Ukrainian President that led to the impeachment inquiry ""includes references to other developments tied to the president, including efforts by Giuliani to insert himself into U.S.-Ukrainian relations."" Giuliani's involvement in the US' relationship with the country has upset some officials in the administration, the paper said.  ""Rudy — he did all of this,"" one US official said, according to the Post. ""This s---show that we're in — it's him injecting himself into the process."" According to the paper, a number of officials ""traced their initial concerns about the path of U.S.-Ukrainian relations to news reports and interviews granted by Giuliani in which he began to espouse views and concerns that did not appear connected to U.S. priorities or policy.""  The Post said Giuliani, who had visited Ukraine in an effort to convince Kiev to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son and his business dealings in the country, ""regularly briefed Trump on his Ukrainian endeavors.""  There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. The Post also said that among Giuliani's targets was the former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who began the job near the end of the Obama administration. Giuliani, the Post said, ""targeted Yovanovitch with wild accusations including that she played a secret role in exposing (former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort)."
"His administration refused to   share with Congress an urgent whistleblower complaint by an intelligence agent (although sources familiar with the matter say it may be released Wednesday), so we don't yet know the full details.   Still, media investigations have revealed the main outlines of the story: In July, Trump withheld military aid while pressing President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to look into discredited allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump's leading challenger in the 2020 election. Trump has acknowledged that he spoke with Zelensky about corruption and about Biden. Trump would  have us believe  that this is all perfectly normal, and that his withholding of the military aid had nothing to do with his desire for an investigation of Biden. (On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that he would release the ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky"" Wednesday.) But none of this is normal. In fact, if Trump was trying to make a deal with the President of Ukraine, it was a crass move that put his personal political interests above those of the country he swore to serve. Trump's actions toward Ukraine are likely a violation of  anti-corruption laws , on top of his apparent  violation  of the Whistleblower Protection Act. More importantly, Trump's behavior constitutes a violation of his oath of office, of his vow to ""protect and defend"" his nation, of the trust of the American people and of the most fundamental duties he accepted when he became President of the United States. The apparent extortion of Ukraine is far worse than his solicitation and acceptance of Russian help to win in 2016. We'll see what the transcript of the call reveals, but it's worth noting that CNN reports the call is only part of the whistleblower complaint. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff says that the whistleblower wants to testify before the committee.  When candidate Trump asked the Kremlin to help him defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016 --  saying , ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing"" -- it was a despicable move to solicit assistance from a hostile power to influence an American election. But at the time Trump was a private citizen, without access to the vast power and resources of the executive branch. This time, the President has engaged in what looks very much like extortion: demanding help smearing Biden in exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars in US military aid, and pressuring a desperate country to interfere in the 2020 US elections to help Trump tarnish the Democratic frontrunner. On Tuesday, Trump again  insisted  he'd done nothing wrong and offered a new explanation for why he had withheld military aid, claiming that he'd done so because ""Europe and other nations"" were not contributing to helping Ukraine. That claim is  false , and wouldn't justify the administration in pressuring Ukraine to investigate an opponent, or refusing to comply with a whistleblower law. To all appearances, Trump has put pressure on Ukraine by  hijacking $250 million dollars of US taxpayers' money  that Congress had voted to give Ukraine so it could strengthen its defenses against its aggressive neighbor, Russia -- the country that  helped  Trump win the presidency in 2016. The White House and Congress  clashed bitterly  over Trump's refusal to release these approved funds. After all, Congress made a decision based on what it believed was in the  best interest of US national security . Trump did release the money -- after the whistleblower complaint was filed and was declared an "" urgent concern "" by the nonpartisan inspector general.  When Trump told President Zelensky last July to investigate Joe Biden and his son -- Trump made the demand about eight times in one conversation,  according to  the Wall Street Journal -- he was, at minimum, implicitly threatening that Ukraine's relationship with the United States, including military aid, was at stake. Whether or not he phrased it in such crass terms is only marginally important. In pressuring Ukraine like this, Trump is leaving the country with a crushingly difficult choice. At the moment, the country is doing battle with  Russian-backed, Russian-armed rebels , just five years after Russia invaded Ukraine's Crimea, and Russia continues actively  assaulting  Ukrainian sovereignty. On the call with Zelensky, Trump insisted that Ukraine deal with his attorney, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. According to Ukraine's  summary of the call , Trump expressed optimism that the new Ukrainian government would forcefully pursue ""corruption cases"" which inhibited the interaction between the two countries. In the White House description of the call, which does not appear on the White House website, Trump  congratulated  President Zelensky on the latter's election and ""discussed ways to strengthen cooperation."" There was no mention of investigations in the White House description of the July call.   A crucial, disturbing aspect of this scandal is that it breathes life into Trump's unsubstantiated accusations against Biden. Trump loyalists  are telling  Fox News viewers that there's a real scandal here, even though Ukrainian prosecutors insist the former Vice President  did nothing wrong.  In addition to breaking faith with US voters and undermining the US national interest, the apparent extortion attempt may well qualify as criminal conduct under the  Hobbs Act , a statute that bans public officials from demanding something of value in exchange for carrying out the duties of their office.  Trump, to all accounts, demanded something of value from the Ukrainian President: namely, help tarnishing his political rival. And he did not carry out the duty of disbursing legally mandated aid until September 11, weeks after the whistleblower had filed his complaint.  Along with Pelosi, another central figure who has been reluctant to call for impeachment appears to be changing his mind.  Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that he is not yet sure whether the Ukraine call was the subject of the whistleblower complaint, but that if a sitting president's telephone call with a foreign leader ""involve(d) potential corruption or criminality,"" or was used for ""political advantage against our nation's interest,"" then that would be the  gravest violation yet  of this presidency -- or perhaps of ""any presidency."" If that is indeed what happened, and the signs strongly suggest it is, then Trump's behavior makes Watergate look like petty pickpocketing. Trump likely betrayed his country, and he did it on the world stage, using taxpayers' money and toying with American security. What could be worse?"
"The whistleblower complaint has political implications for both President Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden; analysis from Fox News contributors Judith Miller and Dan Henninger. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., ramped up the pressure on  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , to  pursue impeachment proceedings against President Trump  on Tuesday, telling  Congress  that continual delay would ""betray the foundation of our democracy."" ""The people of this nation realize that if they had committed even a half of the possible violations, the federal government would be swift to seek justice. We cannot delay. We must not wait.

"New questions surround Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son and his ties to the Ukraine; insight from investigative reporter Peter Schweizer, author of 'Secret Empires,' and Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, author of 'Witch Hunt: The Story of the Greatest Mass Delusion in American Political History.' Author  Peter Schweizer  on Friday night addressed the questions surrounding Hunter Biden’s involvement with a  Ukrainian natural gas company  while his father, former Vice President  Joe Biden , oversaw America’s Ukraine policy. ""The underlying story here involves Hunter Biden going around the world really collecting large payments from foreign governments and foreign oligarchs in the case of Ukraine,"" Schweizer, the author of ""Secret Empires,"" said on Fox News'  ""The Ingraham Angle."" CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT Joe Biden, now the Democratic presidential frontrunner for 2020, faced scrutiny for months over accusations that he pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who at that time was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Biden's son. Rudy Giuliani, a personal attorney for President Trump, has suggested that Biden worked to protect the company from investigation while in office. Biden said Friday that the claim has no credibility. The issue involving the Bidens resurfaced Friday after  The Wall Street Journal  reported that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine. Schweizer implied Hunter Biden's credentials didn't match with the position he held, and that the situation looked suspicious. ""He is supposed to be advising them on natural gas regulatory issues. He has no background in Ukraine. He has no background in energy or natural gas. So the question is, What is he being paid for? He's not being paid for his expertise, he has none,"" Schweizer said. ""His father at this time is the point person on U.S. policy to Ukraine.""

"Katie Pavlich and Antjuan Seawright weigh in on how 2020 hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren will pay for 'Medicare-for-all.' Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , took a veiled shot at  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,  in Iowa Saturday for not moving to impeach  President Trump , suggesting that Pelosi's inaction enabled Trump to continue seeking foreign assistance in elections. ""Donald Trump did everything he could to obstruct justice. I read all 448 pages and when I got to the end, I called for the impeachment of Donald Trump,"" Warren said at the Polk County Democratic Party's Steak Fry fundraiser, referring to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report. ""Congress failed to act and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system,” she added. Her comments followed reports that the president repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to look into corruption accusations surrounding former  Vice President Joe Biden  and his son Hunter. NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT While many Democrats called for impeachment after the report surfaced, Pelosi reportedly has continued to oppose the ramping-up of impeachment proceedings.

"Allies of  Joseph R. Biden Jr. , concerned about his slipping poll numbers in the Democratic presidential primary and an onslaught of attacks from President Trump, are weighing whether to mobilize a super PAC supporting Mr. Biden and have held conversations with wealthy donors to gauge their interest in contributing money. Mr. Biden and his campaign aides have said since the start of the race that they would not welcome an outside spending effort on his behalf, and every other major Democratic candidate has sworn off super PACs for the duration of the primary. A spokesman for Mr. Biden on Thursday reiterated that he opposed super PACs and would reject any such group that attempted to support him. Yet several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said  Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations  about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act. “For me, this week puts everything into stark relief,” said Larry Rasky, a former aide to Mr. Biden who is now a political fund-raiser and public relations executive. “And I was already thinking the campaign was being a little naïve about the resources we’d need to fight this.” In Mr. Rasky’s office in Washington last week, a small group of Biden allies briefly discussed the possibility of a pro-Biden super PAC. Philip Munger, a prominent Democratic donor, and Mark Riddle, a political strategist, were among those who participated. Conversations about a super PAC were well underway earlier this month, even before  news broke of Mr. Trump’s attempt to enlist the leader of Ukraine  to investigate Mr. Biden. Mr. Riddle was involved in filing paperwork for a pro-Biden super PAC, named For the People, earlier this year. The Biden campaign disavowed it last spring, and there is no evidence that the group has raised any money since then. Mr. Riddle suggested that could change. “The vice president is getting hit from all directions,” Mr. Riddle said in an interview, alluding to some negative advertising by a Republican group, Great America PAC. “A lot of us believe there should be a fair fight. He can hold his own with his campaign in these early states or whatnot, but there’s only so much incoming somebody can take without a response.” T.J. Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, said Mr. Biden would reject any super PACs that joined the race on his side. Invoking the Supreme Court decision that made such groups legal, Mr. Ducklo said Mr. Biden “has long advocated to reverse Citizens United and stand up against the corrupt money in our politics.” And while some of Mr. Biden’s supporters see the anti-Biden efforts by Mr. Trump’s allies as a reason to solicit their own outside money, Mr. Ducklo said the campaign took an opposing view. “The attacks aimed at this campaign from dark money groups helping Donald Trump spread his outlandish lies and slander have only served as a reminder of the urgent need for campaign finance reform,” Mr. Ducklo said. “Which is exactly why since the beginning of this campaign, Biden for President has not and will not welcome the help of super PACs. That goes for those that purport to help him, despite his explicit condemnation of their existence.” In addition to its public statements, Mr. Biden’s campaign has warned off some Democrats from participating in a super PAC. One prominent Democrat, David Wilhelm, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he had been approached about being involved in the pro-Biden super PAC but had declined to do so after the campaign urged him against it. Mr. Riddle said a final decision about whether to deploy a super PAC for Mr. Biden would be made in “the coming weeks.” Mr. Biden clearly needs to jolt his campaign, which has  lost ground  in the early nominating states to Senator  Elizabeth Warren , who has been largely unscathed by her rivals. And the vice president’s longtime friends increasingly believe that Ms. Warren’s growing strength — along with Mr. Trump’s offensive — is reason enough to risk the backlash they would get from their opponents and campaign finance reform advocates for creating a group reliant on large contributions. But Mr. Riddle said there had been no final decision on whether to proceed with a super PAC, in part because of this risk. Mr. Biden’s two leading competitors for his party’s nomination, Ms. Warren and Senator  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont, have made getting big money out of politics a major theme of their campaigns. And Mr. Biden has already drawn criticism for his comparative reliance on wealthy donors to fund his candidacy. “I’m mindful that any effort to do this is going to be disowned by the campaign because of the way Warren has replayed her hand,” said Mr. Rasky, alluding to the senator’s decision not to solicit large campaign checks as a presidential candidate, despite having done so in her Senate campaign. Mr. Riddle said that any pro-Biden advertising would be focused on responding to attacks from Mr. Trump and Republicans, rather than targeting other Democrats.  Despite Mr. Munger’s presence at the meeting last week, Mr. Riddle said Mr. Munger was not involved in devising the pro-Biden group and had not contributed any money so far. Mr. Munger is the son of Charles Munger, a billionaire who is the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment firm. There have been a few fitful attempts so far to use super PACs on behalf of specific Democratic presidential candidates, but none of them has had a major impact on the race. A super PAC promoting Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington ran a wave of television ads in Iowa, but Mr. Inslee did not rise in the polls. And Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey sternly disavowed an effort by one Democratic donor, Steve Phillips, to lead a super PAC promoting his campaign. Tiffany Muller, president of End Citizens United, a progressive group that supports stricter campaign finance laws, said Mr. Biden was right to reject any group that might attempt to raise and spend money in unlimited increments. She credited him with being “an outspoken opponent of single-candidate super PACs.” “The Democratic nominee should be chosen by voters, not millionaires and corporate special interests,” Ms. Muller said. Still, Mr. Biden’s political position now appears precarious enough that some of his supporters believe it may be worth taking the considerable risk of activating a group that could raise and spend large sums of money to support him. While Mr. Biden remains at the top of the Democratic field, his poll numbers have slowly weakened over the course of the race, leaving him at risk of slipping behind Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders in three of the four early primary and caucus states. A poll released this week by Quinnipiac University found Ms. Warren slightly ahead of Mr. Biden in the preferences of Democratic voters nationwide, though her lead was less than the margin of error. The next round of fund-raising reports, due after the end of the month, will also reveal whether Mr. Biden is still in a strong financial position relative to his nearest competitors. In the last quarter, Mr. Biden raised the second-most money of any candidate, trailing only  Pete Buttigieg , the mayor of South Bend, Ind. But he finished June with less money in the bank than Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Senator  Kamala Harris  of California."
"Sen. Elizabeth Warren overtakes Democratic presidential rivals Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders in latest New Hampshire poll; reaction from Robin Biro, former Obama campaign regional field director. A union that represents 15,000 health care workers in California – the largest state to vote on Super Tuesday next March – is splitting its endorsement between  Sens. Bernie Sanders  and  Elizabeth Warren , the two populist standard-bearers in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. The National Union of Healthcare Workers – which backed the  independent senator from Vermont  in his 2016 Democratic presidential primary bid – announced on Thursday that they’ll provide resources and grassroots support to both Sanders and Warren. SANDERS CAMPAIGN SWIPES AT WARREN, TESTING TRUCE BETWEEN THE PROGRESSIVE 2020 CHAMPIONS The union explained that the gap between Warren and Sanders in a vote by union members was close enough that the union’s executive board decided on Wednesday to endorse both candidates. “This is not your typical union endorsement. We didn’t tell our members how to vote, they told us,” union president Sal Rosselli said. “We trust our members and their judgments and the outcome of this vote reflects the collective will of members from San Diego to the Oregon border. Our members clearly like both Senators Warren and Sanders.” “After reviewing the vote totals, our executive board felt that an endorsement of both candidates was most fair due to the closeness of the vote,” he explained.  Union members voted from Sunday through Wednesday, with members able to cast a ballot for up to three candidates. Warren received the most votes, appearing on 61 percent of ballots, with Sanders showing up on 50 percent of ballots. Home-state Sen. Kamala Harris appeared on 34 percent of ballots. She was endorsed by the union in her races for California attorney general and her 2016 election to the U.S. Senate. Former Vice President Joe Biden was fourth in the voting, showing up on 32 percent of ballots. WARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN IN LATEST POLLS, SANDERS SLIPS TO THIRD The splitting of the endorsement comes as some in the Sanders campaign are starting to take aim at Warren. Both Sanders and Warren have – to date – refrained for criticizing each other.  But new national and early voting state polls released over the past week indicate Warren soaring into a tie with long-time front-runner Biden for the top spot in the 2020 Democratic battle, with Sanders dipping to third. Earlier this month  Warren  landed the endorsement  of the New York-based progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid."

"John Yoo and Buck Sexton react. President Trump  nominated a slew of judges Friday to posts on California-based federal courts, ramping up efforts to reshape the judiciary after hitting a milestone earlier this month with the confirmation of the 150th federal judge on his watch. Two nominations are for the influential San Francisco-based  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , a long-liberal bench with jurisdiction across the American West whose political makeup has shifted with Trump’s aggressive appointment campaign. TRUMP TAKES ON CALIFORNIA OVER FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS Among the nominees is Patrick Bumatay, a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of California whom Trump nominated last year for the same job. But objections from California Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, over his lack of judicial experience and other issues, derailed the nomination. Trump later nominated Bumatay, who is openly gay, to a district court seat but his name resurfaced over the summer for a possible comeback bid for the Ninth Circuit amid a new vacancy.  While it is traditional for a nominee's home-state senators to give their approval, it is not required, and Trump lately has  bypassed the so-called “blue slip” tradition  in order to get conservative judges on the bench. While Democrats have fumed at the tactics, conservatives cheered Trump this month for seeing the 150th federal judge confirmed. “This is a historic milestone,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a statement. “As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will continue to push through highly qualified, conservative judges at all levels of the federal courts.” Graham and his Republican allies on the committee are likely to be receptive to Trump’s latest picks. Trump also nominated Lawrence VanDyke, a Justice Department official and former Nevada solicitor general, for the Ninth Circuit. Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, praised his record fighting “the overreach by the Obama Administration and its job-killing EPA.” Trump on Friday announced four other nominees for California District Court posts. But the Ninth Circuit has been a focal point given the sprawling territory it covers and its record in decades past of liberal-leaning rulings. Under Trump, the court has shifted more moderate with the addition of seven Trump-appointed judges. Nearly half of the 29 seats are now occupied by GOP-appointed judges. Last year, that number stood at six. NINTH CIRCUIT HANDS TRUMP WIN ON ASYLUM POLICY Earlier this month, the court handed Trump a win as it lifted a nationwide injunction on his controversial asylum policy, ruling that for now the injunction should only apply to states within the circuit. Trump also scored a victory from a California district court on Thursday when a Bush-appointed judge granted a request to block, for now, a law requiring presidential candidates to release tax returns in order to run in the state primaries. Democrats, though, have accused the Trump administration, along with GOP allies in the Senate, of destroying congressional custom by moving past consultations with home-state senators. Feinstein, in a floor speech over the summer about another Ninth Circuit nomination, said, “This disregard of blue slips represents another breakdown of Senate traditions.” She said screening candidates for lifetime appointments to ensure they’re qualified is a “critical” task and warned Republicans: “What goes round, comes around.” The latest nominations also come amid new legal battles between the Trump administration and California. Early Friday afternoon, 23 states banded together to sue the administration in a bid to stop its plan to revoke California’s authority to set strict fuel economy standards. That suit was filed in a D.C. federal court and does not fall in the Ninth Court, but California Attorney General Xavier Becerra touted prior rulings in his state that upheld California’s standards. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Two courts have already upheld California’s emissions standards, rejecting the argument the Trump Administration resurrects to justify its misguided Preemption Rule.

"Whistleblower complaint sparks questions about Joe Biden's dealings with Ukraine; Peter Doocy reports from Des Moines, Iowa. President Trump ’s allies are leaning into the controversy over a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, gambling that the increased attention to the story could actually hurt the president’s potential 2020 rival  Joe Biden . For days, Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump in July pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden family dealings – using military aid as leverage – and cited the reports to revive calls for the president's impeachment. But the firestorm, apparently related to a still-secret whistleblower complaint, has, in turn, opened the door for Republicans to revisit the original controversy involving Joe Biden's son Hunter. Further, they allege, the details of that story suggest Biden did the same thing Trump is accused of doing -- leveraging military aid to pressure Ukraine. GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN “The more they want to talk about Ukraine, the better,” Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Monday morning on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria.” Giuliani has long been looking into the Bidens’ ties to Ukraine, claiming Hunter Biden improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioning whether his dad helped protect him. Hunter Biden was hired by Burisma in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted by protesters and as his father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration. Two years later, then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired. Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner. Trump has claimed Shokin ""was after"" Hunter Biden and the vice president was trying to protect his son. “The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” Monday. Fox News reported on the Biden  controversy in April . The  New York Times  published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But the controversy flew largely under the radar until now. While the heat is on Trump over whether or not he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context. Trump allies are hammering that as the real scandal, as video of Biden once bragging about his role in having Shokin fired has gone viral. BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN LIKELY COMING TO AN END, NUNES SAYS Biden has denied wrongdoing, with Shokin having already been suspected of corruption before his dismissal, and hammered Trump over the reports on his phone conversation with Kiev. For his part, Trump  addressed  his phone call with Zelensky by calling the conversation “perfect” and insisting “there was no quid pro quo” and that he “said absolutely nothing wrong.” Trump also insists that the idea of withholding military aid from Ukraine is bogus because he gave the aid. Trump also tweeted Sunday night, stating that the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin. Giuliani is also trying to circulate new Biden allegations. Giuliani accused Kiev  on Monday of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden and suggested the Obama administration turned a blind eye. ""If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,” he tweeted. ""Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?"" While the former vice president has claimed he and his son never discussed Hunter’s business, Hunter told  The New Yorker  that they did talk about it once, with Joe Biden telling his son, ""I hope you know what you are doing."" Democrats and Republicans are both pushing for investigations. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has shied away from calling for impeachment in the past, told CNN on Sunday that the latest allegations against Trump may warrant such a measure. “If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit … then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents,” Schiff said. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls for impeachment for other alleged Trump transgressions, said Sunday that unless acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire provides information about the whistleblower complaint involving Trump to Congress, administration officials ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation."" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., meanwhile, told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that he wants the Justice Department to look into the Bidens’ dealings with Ukraine. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Nobody’s looked at this, but somebody should, so I’m hoping the Department of Justice will look at the Biden-Ukraine connection like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection,” Graham said. “Was there a relationship between the vice president’s family and the Ukraine business world that was inappropriate?

Somebody other than me needs to look at it, and I sure as hell don’t trust the media to get to the bottom of it.” All this comes as Democrats continue to battle for the 2020 presidential nomination.

"""This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power to get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things if that's what happened, that appears to be what happened ... This is outrageous,"" the former vice president and 2020 Democratic candidate told reporters on Saturday before attending the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry in Des Moines, Iowa. Biden's comments come following news that  Trump pressed Ukrainian President Vologymyr Zelensky  in a July 25 phone call to investigate Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the situation. Trump has defended the call, dubbing criticism of it a ""Ukraine Witch Hunt.""  There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Speaking to local media Saturday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said he didn't think Trump had tried pressuring Zelensky during the July call, but he stopped short of saying the subject of Biden's son wasn't raised.  ""There was talk ... leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on a lot of questions, sometimes requiring serious answers,"" Prystaiko said. Biden, when asked by reporters Saturday how many times he had discussed his son Hunter's overseas business affairs, said, ""I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,"" telling the reporter who posed the question: ""You should be looking at Trump."" ""Trump is doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum and he is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" he said, growing increasingly irritated. ""Everybody looked at this and everybody who's looked at it said there's nothing there. Ask the right question."" Trump on Sunday pointed to what he says is an inconsistency in Biden's statement, telling reporters Biden ""made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son."" Hunter Biden, according to a story  published in The New Yorker in July , said he and his father had previously discussed the matter one time, saying: ""Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing,' and I said, 'I do.' "" On Saturday, Biden turned to the Democrat's 2020 presidential challenge to Trump, calling the President a ""serial abuser,"" repeating that he knows what he's up against but that Trump ""crossed the line."" ""A serial abuser, that's what this guy is,"" Biden said. ""He abuses power everywhere he can. If he sees any threat to his staying in power -- he'll do whatever he has to do. But this crosses the line. This crossed the line."" When asked if Trump should be impeached for the call, Biden replied that ""depending on what the House finds, he could be impeached,"" but he declined to go further in calling for impeachment.  Biden also called for Trump to release the transcript of his call with Zelensky to Congress. Biden isn't alone in demanding details from the call. Earlier this month, the chairmen of the House committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight announced an investigation into allegations that Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani had pressured the Ukrainian government to back Trump's reelection campaign. The lawmakers requested a transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and the Ukrainian president -- which reports later identified as the date Trump allegedly asked for an investigation into Biden's son. Later Saturday, California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, promised ""something very big, early next week if we don't get the documents that we've asked for."" ""We're going to take very aggressive action,"" Khanna told CNN's S.E. Cupp on Saturday, refusing to provide particulars. ""It could be anything from subpoenaing people who were possibly involved in the call to doing everything possible to get the documents that we believe that we're owed."" This story has been updated to note what Trump says is an inconsistency in Biden's comment concerning discussions with his son."
"Acting DNI Joseph Maguire testifies before the House Intelligence Committee on whistleblower complaint. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, in tense testimony Thursday on Capitol Hill, defended his handling of the explosive whistleblower  complaint  alleging President Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the Biden family -- while calling the matter ""unprecedented."" But after maintaining his composure for most of the morning, his frustration showed through at the end, when House Intelligence  Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif., repeatedly pressed him to agree that the matter should be investigated. READ THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT Maguire stressed that the committee now has all of the relevant information, including the whistleblower complaint itself that was released publicly Thursday morning, and said it's up to them to decide how to proceed. “The horse has left the barn,” Maguire said. “You have all of the information. You have the whistleblower complaint. You have the letter from the ICIG. You have the Office of Legal Counsel opinion and you have the transcript from the president.” Maguire also stressed that the complaint was essentially ""hearsay"" and not “corroborated by other folks.” “This is second-hand information. I am not criticizing the whistleblower,” Maguire said. “... I am in no position to tell the committee to do an investigation or not to do an investigation.” Schiff vowed at the end ""we are gonna find out"" the backstory, including whether U.S. aid was tied in any way to Trump's investigation request, which the president denies. The combative conclusion of the session reflected the high tensions and enormous stakes surrounding Maguire's appearance. The rare open hearing of the intelligence committee commanded Washington's political attention given the implications for the newly launched impeachment inquiry against Trump, related to the whistleblower complaint. Shortly after the hearing ended, Trump fired back on Twitter, saying: “Adam Schiff has zero credibility. Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party!” He told reporters that the process is a “disgrace,” defended his Ukraine call as “absolutely perfect” and accused Democrats of bringing any legislative progress to a standstill. “They’re frozen, the Democrats,” he said. Maguire's reputation was also on trial Thursday. He has come under fire from Democrats for initially withholding a copy of the complaint from lawmakers. That standoff was technically resolved when the complaint was declassified, and released to the public, in advance of the hearing. But Maguire was still pressed for answers from Democratic committee members on why his office did not hand over the complaint at first. Maguire insisted he is ""not partisan"" and ""not political,"" reminding the panel that he served under eight presidents and has taken the oath of office 11 times. ""I have served and led through turbulent times,"" he said.  ""... My integrity has never been questioned until now."" However, he maintained, ""I believe that I handled this matter in full compliance with the law at all times.” At one point in the hearing, during a tense exchange with Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., about allegations in the complaint of a potential “cover-up” regarding the Ukraine call, Maguire pushed back again by reminding the committee that the complaint was not based on direct knowledge. “This is second-hand information from a whistleblower. I have no knowledge if that is a true and accurate statement,” Maguire said regarding the “cover-up” claim. The complaint said White House officials tried to “lock down” records of the call. In the same document, the whistleblower also acknowledged not being a “direct witness” to most of the events described, instead citing other U.S. officials who are not named. Republican members also jumped to Maguire's defense at the hearing, while accusing Democrats of launching an ""information warfare operation"" against Trump. Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said of Maguire: ""I think you're nuts if you're going to convince the American people that your cause is just by attacking this man, by impugning his character."" Schiff, meanwhile, questioned Maguire over the timeline of his cooperation with the committee. Maguire said he was not able to release the document at first because of executive privilege concerns and other issues. He also said he is not aware of any instance where such a complaint dealt with such ""complicated and sensitive issues."" ""I believe that this matter is unprecedented,"" he testified. He also said he does not know the identity of the whistleblower, but said he or she acted in ""good faith."" Maguire maintained that he was ""not stonewalling"" despite the delay in the release of the complaint to the committee, but following ""the law the way it was written, not the law as people might wish it to be."" Maguire again explained that he was required to review the complaint for executive privilege. ""It took longer than I would have liked,"" he said. ""But once the transcripts were released, no longer was there an issue of executive privilege ... so then I was able to release the information to you."" He added: ""At no time did I ever try to withhold information."" The complaint cites “multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call"" between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and accuses Trump of attempting “to pressure the Ukranian leader to take actions to help the President’s 2020 reelection bid.” It also presents allegations that the White House tried to ""restrict access"" to records of the call. The complaint goes on to allege that White House officials said they were ""directed"" by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept. Instead, the transcript was allegedly kept on a different system normally used for classified information. WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT HAS BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND CONTAINS NO 'SURPRISES,' GOP LAWMAKER SAYS Meanwhile, Republicans on the committee, including Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., accused Democrats of orchestrating a public spectacle. ""I want to congratulate the Democrats on the rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president, and their extraordinary ability once again to enlist the mainstream media in their campaign,"" Nunes said, adding that  “we’ve been treated to an unending parade of press releases, press conferences, and fake news stories.” ""The released transcript of the call has already debunked that central assertion, but that didn't matter,"" he continued. ""The Democrats simply moved the goalposts and began claiming that there doesn't need to be a quid pro quo for this conversation to serve as the basis for impeaching the president."" The White House, on Wednesday, released an unclassified version of the transcript of that controversial phone call. The memo, which does not reflect a “verbatim transcript” but is based on “notes and recollections” of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of the Bidens, seeking an investigation of some kind. Maguire says that the whistleblower complaint released Thursday ""is in alignment with what was released yesterday by the president."" Trump first asked Zelensky to do a ""favor"" and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks. Then, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens. “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.” This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention. DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE While the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to “look into” the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid — which had been frozen days earlier, a detail that fueled impeachment calls earlier this week and helped prompt House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday. Hours after the transcript was released, Trump met with Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Reporters asked Zelensky about the call with Trump, and whether he felt pressured by the U.S. president, as alleged by the whistleblower—an accusation he denied. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “I think you read everything. I’m sorry but I don’t want to be involved in democratic elections of the USA,” he said. “We had a good phone call. It was normal, we spoke about many things.” He added: “I think you read it that nobody pushed me.” Republicans have also raised concerns about the whistleblower's possible ""political bias,"" as the intelligence community inspector general found indications the whistleblower was ""in favor of a rival political candidate"" of Trump.

"Asked by CNN at Saturday's Iowa Steak Fry as she was leaving the grill area what steps Congress needed to take, the Massachusetts senator said, ""Impeachment, we need to start impeachment proceedings."" Warren, who is running for President,  first called for impeachment proceedings in April  after she read  special counsel Robert Mueller's report  on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.  Since then, she has repeatedly called for the House to begin impeachment proceedings but took it a step further Friday by calling Congress ""complicit"" in ""failing to act.""  ""After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment,""  she wrote in a tweet Friday evening . ""By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump's latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president."" She also wrote in a thread  that the President ""continues to commit crimes"" because ""he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won't either.""  She told reporters after a climate change town hall Friday evening that Trump ""continues to show that he has no regard for the law."" She did not address Biden in her tweets or with reporters. ""The way to hold the President accountable is for Congress to begin an impeachment proceeding. Congress hasn't done that,"" she told reporters in Cedar Rapids. ""And what the President has now demonstrated is that he thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors. He can go back to the well on exactly what he did before. And that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election. It's time for Congress to step up and begin serious impeachment proceedings against this man."" Trump pressed Ukraine's President to investigate Biden's son  during a call earlier this summer, a person familiar with the situation told CNN on Friday.  That call, which took place on July 25, a day after Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the intelligence community inspector general, the source added. The Wall Street Journal was first to report that Trump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the July phone call to investigate Biden's son, citing multiple people familiar with the matter."
"On Fox News, Tucker Carlson agreed with a guest who said of allegations against President Trump, “This is all acceptable political behavior by presidents.” Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader,  tweeted : “House Democrats should stop lying to the American people. They aren’t concerned with the truth. They are still focused on undoing the 2016 election.” A right-wing group, Americans for Limited Government, offered this take: “Pelosi proposes impeaching Trump for denouncing Obama-Biden-led corruption in Ukraine.” We’re going to encounter more of these tornadoes of obfuscation in the coming months. So let’s debunk this nonsense. Whether one is for or against impeachment, facts still have value: Trump did not engage in “acceptable political behavior,” this is not about undoing the 2016 election and Biden didn’t do anything corrupt.  A starting point is the White House’s reconstruction of Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  The document  notes that it “is not a verbatim transcript,” and I can’t help wondering if it has been somewhat sanitized, but it is still unlike any presidential communication I can think of in my 35-year career in journalism. Days before the call, Trump had put a hold on nearly $400 million in military assistance to Ukraine to fend off Russian aggression. On the phone, Zelensky delicately raised the question of getting military aid. “I would like you to do us a favor, though,” Trump responded. I read that “though” as meaning:  Yeah, we can help you defend yourselves, but I want something from you, too.  Trump then asked Zelensky to coordinate with Attorney General William Barr on a politically driven investigation to help Trump in 2020. The quid pro quo was implicit — rather like the gangster who drops in on a store and offers to provide “protection.” Trump in essence was saying:  Such a nice country you have. Shame if anything were to happen to it. By the way, can you do me a favor? Just in case Zelensky was particularly thick, Trump noted that the U.S. had been very helpful to Ukraine, said that Ukraine had not reciprocated, held out the promise of a meeting if Zelensky cooperated, and repeatedly encouraged Zelensky to speak to Barr and to his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. If it were a single reference, one might wonder how much to make of it. But here is a compilation of Trump’s hints in the call: “I would like to have the attorney general call you. … It’s very important that you do it. … I will ask him [Giuliani] to call you along with the attorney general. … If you could speak to him, that would be great. … If you can look into it [the Biden matter] … it sounds horrible to me. … I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call. … I’m sure you will figure it out. … Your economy is going to get better and better, I predict. … I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call. … Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call.” If that presidential call were set to music, it could be the soundtrack for a “Godfather” movie. The Times  reports  that the acting director of national intelligence and the inspector general for the intelligence community — each appointed by Trump — both referred the matter to the Justice Department for possible criminal investigation into the president’s actions. Surprise! Barr’s Justice Department decided not to pursue the matter. As for the assertion that the real corruption is that of Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, that’s false. Ukraine  said in May  that there was no evidence of illegality by Hunter. I do think that he inappropriately played on his father’s job as vice president to get a board seat with a Ukrainian gas company, just as Trump’s children — and Trump himself — have monetized Trump’s presidency. But whatever Hunter’s impropriety, there is  zero evidence  of misconduct by his father. Journalists may try to be evenhanded by saying that Trump did this while Biden did that. That is false equivalence. Let’s be clear: Joe Biden appears to be completely innocent of  any  wrongdoing in this case, while Trump tried to use the power of the federal government and almost $400 million in taxpayer money to coerce Ukraine into meddling in a U.S. election. Fresh from allegations of collusion with Russia to win the 2016 election, Trump turns out to have been trying to collude with Ukraine to arrange foreign interference in the 2020 election. An impeachment inquiry will now unfold, and there’s no reason to prejudge the outcome or rush the process. Let the evidence emerge and be debated. No one should be gleeful, for an impeachment process is a trauma for our country — and I’m not sure that Democrats living in blue bubbles appreciate the risk that this process may end up helping Republican candidates. But put politics aside. Trump weaponized taxpayer dollars to coerce a foreign leader to target U.S. citizens with a criminal investigation, aiming to affect an American presidential election. Whether or not you believe that is impeachable, we should be able to agree that it is unconscionable. The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters  to the editor.

"Media's Ukraine frenzy boomerangs back onto Joe Biden. Sean Hannity  opened his television show Monday by thanking the media for unintentionally making  former Vice President Joe Biden 's dealings with  Ukraine  a national story.

UKRAINE PHONE CALL SCANDAL IS MEDIA STRIKING BACK AFTER FAILED RUSSIA HOAX, SAYS DAN BONGINO Trump is accused of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy into investigating Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, for their ties to a natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, which was being investigated as part of a corruption case. Hannity believes the media ""stumbled upon"" a legit claim against Biden. ""In fact, the media unintentionally stumbled on to what are serious credible claims of corruption surrounding one of the president's potential 2020 opponents,"" Hannity said. The host blasted the media's ""obsessive compulsive hysteria"" and argued that their Ukraine accusations are an extension of Russia collusion narrative. ""We have seen this now for over three years.

"""I'm in favor of moving toward impeachment,"" the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee told  People Magazine  in an interview published on Tuesday. ""I did not come to that decision easily or quickly, but this is an emergency as I see it.""  Clinton's call came on the heels of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement on Tuesday of a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, as House Democrats increasingly support proceedings to investigate the potential for impeachment. ""We are in a crisis,"" Clinton said, later adding that the House must begin impeachment proceedings ""not happily or with glee"" but to safeguard national security. Clinton cited reports that  Trump pressed Ukraine's President to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son  earlier this summer, and that he  requested a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine  roughly one week before the call, in her reasoning for impeachment proceedings. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. ""This latest behaviors around Ukraine, trying to enlist the President of Ukraine in a plot to undermine former Vice President Biden or lose the military aide he needs to defend against Trump's friend, Vladimir Putin -- if that's not an impeachable offense, I don't know what is,"" Clinton told People. Trump  asserted Monday that he delayed aid  to Ukraine ahead of the call but claimed it was unrelated to Biden, and remained defiant Tuesday that he's done nothing wrong and has no regrets about his behavior when it comes to Ukraine and seeking an investigation into Biden's son's dealings.  Clinton called Trump ""a reckless, corrupt human tornado"" and ""a clear and present danger to the future of the United States,"" accusing him of ""betraying our country on a daily basis"" and ""undermining the more perfect union"" of the United States."
"Comey, a staunch critic of Trump, appeared to shift his views hours after the  release of a White House transcript  of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday in which Trump repeatedly pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. ""Some media are quoting me from last week about my hope that America will remove Donald Trump by an election, not impeachment,"" Comey said in a Twitter post. ""But we may now be at the point where members of the House and Senate can't uphold their own oaths to support and defend the Constitution without acting."" When asked in an interview with CNN affiliate  KCRA  last week if he thought Trump should be impeached, Comey said Congress should figure out whether alleged actions  mentioned in the Mueller report  would ""trigger impeachment,"" but as a citizen he hoped Trump would not be impeached. ""Because I think the American people would be let off the hook if Donald Trump were impeached and removed from office, and a lot of his supporters would think some kind of coup had taken place,"" Comey said in the KCRA interview. ""We need to take responsibility for this and vote next November and show that we have a certain set of values and we insist that our leaders reflect those values. So we need an inflection point. An impeachment would deprive us of that and we need to show what we stand for."" According to the transcript, Trump repeatedly pushed for Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son during a July 25 phone call. The transcript also reveals the President also asked the Ukrainian leader to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and US Attorney General William Barr on the issue. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump fired Comey as FBI director in 2017, citing his handling of the probe  into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server , though he later said  ""this Russia thing""  -- referring to the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election -- was a factor as well."

"Although neither candidate holds a clear lead at this point, the new poll finds Warren and Biden well ahead of other contenders for the Democratic nomination. Sen.  Bernie Sanders ' support has dipped to 11% in this poll, with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor  Pete Buttigieg  at 9% and Sen.  Kamala Harris  at 6%. Sens.  Cory Booker  and  Amy Klobuchar  each land at 3%, while Rep.  Tulsi Gabbard , former Rep.  Beto O'Rourke , investor  Tom Steyer  and businessman  Andrew Yang  each have the backing of 2% of likely caucusgoers. The poll marks Gabbard's third qualifying poll for inclusion in October's Democratic debates. The rest of the field each notched 1% or less. Warren's improved standing overall in the Iowa poll comes on the heels of a stronger showing in recent national polls and is bolstered by an increasing positive favorability rating (75% have a favorable view, the best in the field, and she is one of only four candidates who have improved their net favorability since the June CNN/DMR poll), as well as a growing percentage of likely caucusgoers who say she is either their first choice, second choice or someone they are actively considering. All told, 71% are at least considering Warren's candidacy, ahead of the next best candidate on that score by 11 points (Biden at 60%). Her supporters are also more enthusiastic than those behind Biden (32% of her backers are extremely enthusiastic vs. 22% for the former vice president). The Massachusetts senator appears to be gaining ground primarily at the expense of Sanders. She holds the support of 32% of those who say they caucused for Sanders in 2016 (Sanders himself stands at 25% among that group), stands at 48% among those who consider themselves ""very liberal,"" and for the first time in CNN/DMR polling on the race, has edged ahead of Sanders among those under age 35 (27% back Warren, 22% Sanders). Biden's core backers remain behind him in largely the same way they were in the previous poll. Among seniors, he is the first choice of 35%, about the same as earlier this year. And he remains above 30% support with moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers. And Warren's supporters are a bit less apt to be locked in than are those backing Biden (12% of Warren supporters say their mind is made up vs. 26% of Biden's supporters). Overall, though, just 20% of likely caucusgoers say their mind is made up now, suggesting there is plenty of room for these preferences to shift before February. Shifts in favorability For many in the field, a summer spent campaigning in Iowa has done little to improve their chances there. Aside from Warren, no candidate has made meaningful gains in overall support compared with their backing among likely caucus attendees in June, and 10 candidates saw their unfavorable ratings rise by double-digits without an equivalent rise on the positive side of things, including a whopping 30-point increase in negative views of author Marianne Williamson, a 23-point jump for former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro and increases in the teens for former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. Sanders and Biden each saw an increase in unfavorable views alongside a drop in favorable ratings (Sanders shifted from 70% favorable and 25% unfavorable to a 58% favorable to 36% unfavorable rating; Biden's favorable numbers dipped 6 points to 66% while his unfavorable rating rose 5 to 29%). Yang also saw his unfavorable numbers grow, but the rise was matched by the increase in his favorability rating. Beyond Warren's gains, Buttigieg boosted his favorable rating 8 points to 69% without an appreciable rise in unfavorable views, Klobuchar saw favorable views gain 6 points to top 50% for the first time, while her unfavorable numbers rose 4 points, and Booker's favorability climbed 5 points to 60% as the unfavorable side gained just 3 points. Prioritizing electability Though views on the candidates have shifted, those likely to attend Iowa's Democratic caucuses remain more apt to prioritize nominating a candidate with a strong chance of beating Trump (63%) over one who shares their positions on major issues (31%). And most think that after Trump, American government could return to the way it was before his election (59%). The poll sought to gain insight into what it is likely caucusgoers think an electable candidate would be. Nearly three-quarters said a candidate who can excite new voters (74%) is closer to their vision of electability than one who would excite the base (16%). And most preferred a candidate who would represent a new generation of leadership (57%) over one with a long history in government (28%), as well as one who would take the high road against Trump (54%) vs. getting in the mud as needed to take on the President (35%).  Roughly two-thirds felt the more electable candidate is one who seeks common ground with Republicans (63%) rather than moving the country to the left (28%). But in assessing six positions that have become signatures of the more liberal candidates in the Democratic field, the poll finds wide variation in likely caucusgoers' level of comfort with them. Support for policy positions Clear majorities say that they are personally comfortable with policies that would raise taxes on the wealthy (74%) and restore the ban on assault-style weapons (69%) and they feel candidates ought to run on those positions. Fewer felt the same about the Green New Deal (48%), ""Medicare for All"" (41%), free tuition for public colleges (36%) and moving the country in a socialist direction (20%). Views on Medicare for All in particular are starkly divided between those backing Warren or Sanders -- the strongest proponents of such a plan among the Democratic candidates -- and those who favor other candidates. Among supporters of Warren or Sanders, 63% say they're comfortable with Medicare for All and want candidates to run on it, while among those backing other candidates, just 29% feel the same way. Perceptions on these policy positions are one sharp divider between supporters of the two top candidates. Among Warren's supporters, 64% say that none of the six tested positions are bad policy. Among Biden's backers, though, just 29% feel the same way. The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll was conducted by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, September 14 through 18 among a random sample of 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample of likely caucusgoers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points."

"After several months, when Pelosi resisted taking this step for fear of a political backlash, President Trump finally found a way to go too far. It turns out that there might still be a line in American politics, and he just crossed it.    As Democrats officially start the impeachment process and undertake the investigation, they will continue to be haunted by historical comparisons. Democrats who are leery about moving forward see the late-1990s impeachment of Bill Clinton all over again. With the 2020 election in the balance, they fear that their party will end up like the Republicans, moving forward to impeach the President only to encounter a fierce political backlash against their party for seeming too extreme.  Other Democrats, who have been calling for impeachment since the release of Robert Mueller's report, see a repeat of the early-1970s. In their minds, Trump is the new Richard Nixon, just on steroids. For them, moving forward with impeachment is not only the right thing to do but it will also strengthen the Democrats politically, by putting them on the right side of history.    The truth is we don't know how this will turn out. The trouble with speculation is that the future remains unpredictable. We can make educated guesses about how the politics might unfold and we can look to previous examples to better understand what is happening. But at the end of the day, the impeachment of Trump must be understood on its own terms.  This process will play out within the particular dynamics of 2019 and 2020. It is easy to map out how either prediction could be true. At the same time, it is even easier to imagine how we can't really envision or anticipate what is going to happen and what the ultimate political effects will be.   The impeachment process is always especially uncertain since it revolves around an intense investigation that sheds light on a situation rather than confirming what we already know. This means that, if the process is handled well, we will have many more facts on the table before any vote for articles of impeachment takes place.   While we live in an era where facts often don't matter and the people make decisions based on partisan preferences, dramatic revelations can still shake the status quo. That's what happened with Nixon -- the process itself dramatically changed public opinion. We have just seen that within the past few hours, as the heads of even the most seasoned Washington watchers are spinning.    Democrats need to make their decisions based on the obligations of the office and a respect for our democratic institutions. If there is one big lesson from the last two of our three impeachment processes -- it is that voters rewarded the party that in 1974 took this bold step but did so in a serious way, focusing on the health of our democratic institutions and the balance of power. When the Republican party seemed to move forward in a haphazard and clearly partisan manner in 1997 and 1998, the public disapproved of their actions.   Although politics is naturally always on the mind of any elected official,  this is a moment when they need to make those considerations secondary. It looks like Democrats have finally reached a point in their thinking, where they are willing to do what is right rather than what might be the easiest political path.    The outstanding question remains the Republicans and whether the revelations that keep emerging are enough to shake them out of a partisan slumber than has led almost all of them to be blindly loyal regardless of what the President does or says. In his latest statement, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not instantly jump to the President's side, vowing to  ""find out what happened.""  Given his history, the odds are that McConnell will stand firmly behind the Republican President. But the thing you learn from history is that politics can move in unexpected directions at the most unexpected of times."

"There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  ""I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,"" Trump tweeted while attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Trump's pledge comes amid growing calls for impeachment. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  announced a formal impeachment inquiry  later Tuesday.  Trump admitted Tuesday that he delayed aid to Ukraine ahead of a call to Zelensky, when he pushed the leader to look into potential rival Joe Biden and his son's work in Ukraine, giving the excuse that he was waiting for European nations to contribute their fair share of aid and claiming there was ""never any quid pro quo."" During a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Joe Biden called for the Trump administration to ""provide Congress with all the facts it need,"" including a copy of the whistleblower's complaint. He said the Zelensky call was ""an abuse of power.""   ""If the President does not comply with such requests to the Congress, he continues to obstruct Congress and flout the law, Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment,"" Biden added.  The President is scheduled to meet with Zelensky at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday. When approached by CNN on Tuesday at the UN General Assembly in New York, Zelensky would not answer if it his understanding was that the aid for Ukraine and an investigation into the Bidens was linked.   Zelensky simply responded that his conversations with the President are ""private and confidential."" When asked if he wanted the transcript of the call to be released, Zelensky said, ""We'll see.""  Trump on Tuesday indicated that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had already received permission from Ukraine to release the transcript. ""Secretary of State Pompeo recieved permission from Ukraine Government to release the transcript of the telephone call I had with their President. They don't know either what the big deal is. A total Witch Hunt Scam by the Democrats!"" Trump tweeted. Trump has remained defiant Tuesday, saying that he's done nothing wrong and has no regrets about his behavior when it comes to Ukraine and seeking an investigation into Biden's son's dealings. Trump has previously branded criticism of the call a ""Ukrainian Witch Hunt"" and called the whistleblower a ""partisan.""  On Monday,  The Washington Post first reported  that the President had directed his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million of US military and security aid to Ukraine in the days before he spoke with Zelensky. When a deadline to disclose the whistleblower report to Congress passed and the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, proceeded not to send the report over, the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, notified House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of an ""urgent concern"" that DNI has overruled. Three House committees launched subsequent investigations into the issue. "
"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden addresses whistleblower complaint, says if President Trump does not fully cooperate with a congressional investigation then Congress will have no choice but to initiate impeachment. Former Vice President Joe Biden  suggested on Tuesday that  President Trump  would only have himself to blame if he faces impeachment. ""Congress should demand the information it has the legal right to receive,"" Biden said Tuesday during a speech in Delaware. ""If the president does not comply with such a request of the Congress, if he continues to obstruct Congress and flout the law, Donald Trump will, in my view, leave Congress with no choice but to initiate impeachment. That would be a tragedy but a tragedy of his own making."" Trump, on Tuesday, announced that he would release the full transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is at the center of the latest controversy Democrats have cited in their push for impeachment. The administration reportedly suppressed a whistleblower seeking to report on Trump and Zelensky's phone call, which reportedly involved the president repeatedly urging his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden, the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Trump has denied any quid pro quo for foreign aid, but  Democrats  have portrayed the call as a second attempt for Trump to welcome outside interference in a presidential election. PELOSI EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP Biden called on Trump to release the full whistleblower report to Congress and comply with other congressional requests. The administration has stonewalled congressional investigations by refusing to comply with subpoenas surrounding the Russia investigation. While  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , has repeatedly resisted calls for impeachment, the Ukraine controversy appeared to change her mind. Fox News has confirmed that the speaker planned to announce a formal impeachment inquiry at 5 p.m. ET on Tuesday. Trump has used the whistleblower controversy to refocus attention on accusations surrounding Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings. Biden allegedly tried to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing a prosecutor who was probing a firm tied to his son. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in the call with Zelensky, insisting that he never engaged in any quid pro quo for foreign aid.

TRUMP UKRAINE GAMES TIP DEMS TOWARD IMPEACHMENT Politico : “President  Donald Trump  on Tuesday shifted his explanation for temporarily withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, citing what he criticized as a lack of similar financial contribution by other Western powers to the Eastern European nation. Trump’s latest remarks are at odds with his assertion Monday that he denied the assistance because he feared bureaucratic corruption within Ukraine’s government. The new claim also comes after weekend reports that he repeatedly pressured newly elected Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky  during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President  Joe Biden ’s son. ‘As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid,’ Trump told reporters Tuesday, ahead of his address to the United Nations General Assembly. ‘But my complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,’ he continued.” Officials say Pelosi quietly making moves -   WaPo:  “[Speaker  Nancy ]  Pelosi , according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has been gauging the mood of her caucus members about whether they believe that allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate a political foe are a tipping point. She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. Pelosi’s conversations — and reconsideration of her long-held position that impeachment is too divisive — come amid a growing clamor for impeachment that extends beyond the party’s liberal base and many Democratic presidential candidates to moderate lawmakers in competitive House seats.” Moderate Dems join the effort -   Fox News:  “A slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that President Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son  Hunter . The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed.” Trump’s attacks on Biden worry Dems of 2016 repeat -   WaPo:  “But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, [the Biden] campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis. … The flurry of online attacks against Biden carries echoes of conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies about  Hillary Clinton ’s health and claims about her foreign entanglements that helped turn voters against her. The onslaught comes at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary contest, as the former vice president attempts to showcase his ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump. But with the Democratic National Committee attempting to be a more neutral arbiter than it was in 2016, when it was accused of aiding Clinton, the party helped monitor viral attacks but publicly remained silent.” THE RULEBOOK: PROVE YOURSELF 
“To reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor, is very often considered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert… and that the less he resembles him, the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents.” –  Alexander Hamilton ,  Federalist No. 72 TIME OUT: ONE OF A KIND  Smithsonian:  “The guitar  Prince  plays in [the  Purple Rain  video] was custom-made for him by a luthier at a Minneapolis music shop called Knut-Koupee Enterprises. … It made sense, even then, that Prince would require an instrument that didn’t resemble anything anyone else was playing. Knut-Koupee made three so-called ‘cloud’ guitars for Prince in the early 1980s. … In 1993, Prince gave a cloud guitar to the Smithsonian Institution, but he didn’t include any information about the instrument’s origins. But earlier this year,  John Woodland , the conservator for Prince’s guitar collection … reached out to the Smithsonian with a sneaking suspicion. After the guitar underwent a CT scan and extensive paint analysis, what they found was a shocker… This wasn’t just  a  cloud guitar, in other words, it was  the  cloud guitar—the instrument responsible for some of the most iconic sounds and images in American popular music.” Flag on the play? -  Email us at  HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM  with your tips, comments or questions.

WARREN CLOSING IN ON BIDEN IN NEVADA USA Today:  “ Elizabeth Warren  has pulled within striking distance of  Joe Biden  for the lead in Nevada's influential presidential caucuses. A new Suffolk University/USA TODAY Network Poll, taken after this month's Democratic debate, shows Biden at 23% and Warren at 19% in Nevada, the state that follows Iowa and New Hampshire in the opening presidential contests next year.  Bernie Sanders  is at 14%. While Warren trailed Biden, the Massachusetts senator was within the margin of error of the former vice president for the first time in a public poll in the Silver State. … Among the second tier of candidates in Nevada, California Sen.  Kamala Harris  was at 4% and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor  Pete Buttigieg , entrepreneur  Andrew Yang  and activist  Tom Steyer  at 3%. … The survey showed Warren positioned to increase her support as the Democratic field narrows. She was the ‘second choice’ of 19%, compared to 16% for Biden, 12% for Sanders and 10% for California Sen. Kamala Harris.” She also joins him upfront in New Hampshire -  Monmouth University:  “Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has joined former Vice President Joe Biden at the front of the pack in New Hampshire, according to the latest Monmouth University Poll. … Among registered New Hampshire Democrats and unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the February 2020 Democratic primary, 27% currently support Warren and 25% support Biden. The only other candidates in double digits are Sanders at 12% and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%. Others with measurable support are California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%), New Jersey Sen.  Cory Booker  (2%), Hawaii Rep.  Tulsi Gabbard  (2%), Minnesota Sen.  Amy Klobuchar  (2%), former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).” Gabbard is the 12th Dem to qualify for October debate -   Politico:  “Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has qualified for the October Democratic presidential primary debate, making her the twelfth candidate to hit the Democratic National Committee's thresholds. Gabbard got 2 percent support in a New Hampshire poll conducted by Monmouth University and released on Tuesday. The Hawaii congresswoman had previously gotten 2 percent in three other DNC-approved polls, and her campaign said she already racked up more than the 130,000 donors she needed to make the debate stage. Gabbard will join Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg,  Julian Castro , Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, Tom Steyer, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang onstage in October.” DNC raises qualifying thresholds for November debate -  Fox News:  “The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates. But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar. The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.” PLAY-BY-PLAY Boris Johnson  in a parliamentary pickle  -  WaPo Pergram: Why Democrats' push for DC statehood will likely keep stalling  -  Fox News AUDIBLE: DON’T GET IT TWISTED, BRO

The Altai, a tugboat operated by the Russian navy’s Northern Fleet, carried researchers from the Russian Geographical Society and other expedition participants into waters near a remote island chain called Franz Josef Land in the Arctic Sea, Ars Technica reported. The boat dispatched a smaller inflatable landing craft in shallow waters off Wilczek Island to bring researchers ashore near Cape Heller. Before the boat could reach the beach, it was attacked by a female walrus who was probably ‘fearing for her cubs,’ according to a press release from the Russian Geographical Society. ‘The boat sank, but a tragedy was avoided thanks to the prompt action by the squad leader.

"""He'd like to get foreign help to win elections,"" Biden said of Trump at a private California fundraiser, according to a pool report, marking his strongest comments to date on the Ukraine scandal.  The Democratic presidential candidate asserted there hasn't been ""one shred of evidence"" showing wrongdoing by his family, according to the report. ""There's nothing anybody in my family did wrong ... at all."" While at the fundraiser, the former vice president quoted an excerpt of a  stunning whistleblower complaint  that was released earlier on Thursday, according to the report. The complaint alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.  Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Thursday  testified before the House Intelligence Committee  about the complaint and  defended the whistleblower , whose identity remains publicly unknown.  A transcript released by the White House  shows  Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate Biden , Trump's potential 2020 political rival, and his son, Hunter, during a July 25 phone call. Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and US Attorney General William Barr on the issue, the call transcript reveals. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. After  Trump admitted to discussing Biden and his son  on a phone call with the Ukrainian President,  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry  into Trump.  More than half  the US House of Representatives have now said they support an impeachment investigation.  Biden said Tuesday, shortly before Pelosi's announcement, if Trump does not cooperate with Congress, he would leave lawmakers with  ""no choice"" but to start impeachment proceedings . By making his call for Trump's removal from office conditional, he stopped short of some of his Democratic rivals, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who are calling for the House to impeach Trump now."

"Ohio Sen. Rob Portman weighs in on U.S. aid package to Ukraine. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said Wednesday on  ""Fox News @ Night""  that he does not agree with Democrats who allege a ""quid pro quo"" was suggested by  President Trump  to the president of Ukraine. ""I don't see the quid pro quo that the Democrats are claiming. In fact, I actually believe that if Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi and the Democrats had taken another 24 hours to make their decision and actually looked at the facts -- which is the transcript itself -- they might not have moved forward because there is no quid pro quo,"" he told anchor Shannon Bream. Democrats allege there was an implied quid pro quo from Trump when he asked Ukrainian Presiden t Volodymyr Zelensky  to investigate potential 2020 rival  Joe Biden  and Biden's son Hunter for possible corruption in exchange for military aid. MICHAEL GOODWIN: PELOSI’S IMPEACHMENT SURRENDER PROVES DEMS STILL CAN’T GET BEYOND 2016 – AND THAT'S RISKY Portman said after reading  the transcript  of the July phone call, released Wednesday by the White House, he does not believe it helps the Democrats' case for impeachment. ""I don't see it. I just don't understand how they can say it's because there's a quid pro quo. And then we find out there's not a quid pro quo that they're still proceeding,"" he said, claiming Trump was hesitant to provide the nearly $400 million in aid without the Europeans also committing to spending more. WATCH: UKRAINE PRESIDENT BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS HE WASN'T PRESSURED Portman, the co-chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, said he had been urging Vice President Mike Pence and top U.S. officials to release the funds ahead of Trump's call with Zelensky, which became the focus of a  whistleblower complaint . ""And on that date, I called the president because we were getting the point where the funds had to be released. And the president was very clear with me. He only raised one issue ... and that was about the Europeans not doing enough,"" he said. Select members of the congressional intelligence committees on Wednesday afternoon  received the whistleblower complaint  and related documents that have sparked the impeachment inquiry, reviewing the materials in closed session.

"Reaction from Brad Woodhouse, former DNC communications director and former Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign surrogate. The transparency group Judicial Watch  announced Thursday  it had filed a  Freedom of Information Act lawsuit  against the State Department, seeking more information about Joe Biden's boast that he pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor. The litigation came a day after President Trump, seeking to  turn the tables against Democrats  as they pursue an impeachment inquiry, highlighted what he called Biden's  own possible misconduct  while in office. “The latest assault on President Trump is an obvious attempt to protect Joe Biden from the corruption scandals involving his son,” Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in a statement. “Judicial Watch’s latest lawsuit will be the first of many to try to get to the bottom of this influence-peddling scandal.” Biden  has acknowledged   on camera  that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire that prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm  Burisma Holdings  — where his son Hunter Biden had a  highly lucrative role  on the board reportedly paying him tens of thousands of dollars per month, despite limited relevant expertise. The former vice president specifically said he threatened to pull nearly $1 billion in Obama administration loan guarantees if Shokin wasn't fired, potentially crippling Ukraine's government. TRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALLEGES BIDEN CORRUPTION, SAYS DEMS THREATENED UKRAINE AID MULTIPLE TIMES Shokin himself had been widely accused of corruption, while  critics charged  that Hunter Biden might have been essentially selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. Judicial Watch said it was pursuing from the State Department ""any and all records regarding, concerning, or related to Viktor Shokin’s investigation of [former Ukrainian energy official] Mykola Zlochevsky and Shokin’s resignation at Ukraine’s Prosecutor General."" Additionally, the organization sought ""any and all records of communication between any official, employee, or representative of the Department of State and any official, employee, or representative of the Office of the Vice President regarding Viktor Shokin."" The lawsuit came only after the State Department refused to turn over the records after receiving a request in May, according to Judicial Watch. WHISTLEBLOWER SETS UP GOFUNDME, WANTS $100G The State Department has not ""produced the requested records or demonstrated that the requested records are lawfully exempt from production .... notified [Judicial Watch] of the scope of any responsive records it intends to produce or withhold and the reasons for any withholdings ... or informed [Judicial Watch] that it may appeal any adequately specific, adverse determination,"" Judicial Watch said in its complaint. Following Trump's  fiery remarks in New York on Wednesday , political scientist Ian Bremmer argued that Hunter Biden's lucrative business work in Ukraine -- rather than Biden's decision to force out Ukraine's prosecutor -- was the real scandal.

So release all the financial records of all businesses involving Biden, Kerry’s stepson and notorious mobster Whitey Bulger’s nephew."" He added: ""Biden should agree to release records to see if he flew Hunter to China in Dec. 2013 on AF 2 to facilitate Hunter’s sale of his office to China for a total of $1.5 billion.

"President Trump's attorney Jay Sekulow on Democrats' push for impeachment on 'Hannity.' CNN anchor Chris Cuomo  made a rare concession on Wednesday night when he said  former Vice President Joe Biden  ""absolutely"" engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine but not for his ""personal advantage."" During a fiery debate with  President Trump 's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, Cuomo argued that a quid pro quo wasn't ""necessary for an abuse of power."" ""This isn't about the law, this is about finding something worthy of impeachment or not,"" Cuomo told Sekulow. ""Something can be wrong, but not a felony... An abuse of power can be wrong but not a felony.""

""And Joe Biden bragged on television that he gave a prosecutor in Ukraine to be fired in six hours or a billion dollars was going to be withheld. Do you think that's a quid pro quo?""

‘DESERVE’S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT’ Let’s start with the precondition that we don’t care whether you think the investigation into  President Trump ’s efforts to get the Ukrainian government to prosecute his political rivals is “THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!” grounds for immediate impeachment or something in between. 
We care in the sense that we’re sure that you are sincere in your beliefs and we acknowledge your God-given right to feel and think the way you do. What we mean is that in order to discern what might happen next, such feelings are hindrances. It’s hard to clearly consider such outcomes when you think in terms of your own beliefs. 
This note, for example, would be a poor source for Major League Baseball forecasting since it is our position that the St. Louis Cardinals not only will win it all but  deserve  to win it all. 
As  William Munny   told   Little Bill Daggett  right before he blew his head off with a Spencer repeating rifle on a saloon floor: “Deserve’s got nothing to do with it.” 
There are plenty of people who think that  Bill Clinton  unfairly beat the rap, and even some who still think  Richard Nixon  got a raw deal. If you flipped through the back pages of enough bibliographies, you might even find some historians with strong feelings about what happened to old  Andy Johnson . Woodrow Wilson  was incapacitated by a stroke in his second term, with his wife acting as a kind of regent for his last 17 months in office but Congress took no action.  Warren Harding ’s administration – in particular his Interior and Justice departments – was a quagmire of corruption, but he was dead and buried before any of it came to light.  Lyndon Johnson  grievously abused the powers of office for political advantage but he never faced any repercussions. 
The rightness or wrongness of a president’s actions are all but immaterial in these matters. Whether the supporters or detractors of the aforementioned men were correct or not was of no consequence. Now, that’s not to say that the passionate partisan bawling that we’re all now being subjected to won’t have an effect on what eventually does happen. Studies suggest  that home field advantage in sports is not only real but quite possibly the result of referees showing favoritism because of “the social atmosphere in the stadium.” The same is true with allegations of presidential misconduct.       We’ve said it many times before, but it bears repeating: Impeachment is a political proposition, not a legal one. And the referees here are the undecided or persuadable voters not yet sure what to make of what’s happening. 
But even if you want to be part of working the refs – screaming into the orc-filled chasms of Twitter or annoying friends and loved ones with forwarded emails and Facebook posts – you probably still want to be able to think clearly about where it goes from here. 
And that’s what we intend to help you do in the days ahead. You have plenty of other options for getting the latest details on what this unnamed source said or what that hearing may or may not have revealed. We’re going to stay focused on the political repercussions because that’s our job.

“The Union here was far more intimate, and its organization much wiser, than in the preceding instance.” –  Alexander Hamilton  and  James Madison ,  Federalist No. 18 TIME OUT: ONCE UPON A TIME… NatGeo:  “The brothers Grimm published what would become one of the most influential and famous collections of folklore in the world. C hildren’s and Household Tales (Kinder und Hausma ̈ rchen) , later titled  Grimm’s Fairy Tales , are childhood-defining stories. The Grimms, however, had curated the collection as an academic anthology for scholars of German culture, not as a collection of bedtime stories for young readers. Amid the political and social turbulence of the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815), as France conquered Germanic lands,  Jacob  and  Wilhelm  were driven by nationalism to highlight their homeland and heritage. They were inspired by German Romantic authors and philosophers who believed that the purest forms of culture, those that bonded a community, could be found in stories shared from generation to generation. Storytelling expressed the essence of German culture and recalled the spirit and basic values of its people. By excavating Germany’s oral traditions, the brothers urgently sought to ‘preserve them from vanishing . . . to be forever silent in the tumult of our times.’” Flag on the play? -  Email us at  HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM  with your tips, comments or questions.

This week  Dana   Perino  and  Chris   Stirewalt  discuss President Trump’s phone call with the Ukrainian president, how impeachment proceedings could affect the 2020 presidential race and Dana starts the countdown until Christmas. Plus, Chris answers trivia.   LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE WARREN SLIPS AND SWIPES BIDEN ON ETHICS Fox News : “Sen.  Elizabeth Warren  spotlighted her longstanding calls for the impeachment of President Trump at a campaign event on Wednesday, emphasizing, ‘I hope we do this and I hope we do this quickly.’ But, she also appeared to unintentionally swipe at a rival Democrat vying for the White House – former Vice President  Joe Biden  – over his family’s role in the Ukraine controversy that led the House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. Taking questions from reporters following a town hall event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on the board of a foreign company if she were president. Warren quickly answered, ‘no.’ When asked why, she said, in a rare moment where she appeared flustered: ‘I don’t know. I have to go back and look at the details.’” More family woes for Biden -   Politico:  “Joe Biden’s brother told executives at a healthcare firm that the former vice president’s cancer initiative would promote their business, according to a participant in the conversation, who said the promise came as part of a pitch on behalf of potential investors in the firm. The allegation is the latest of many times Biden’s relatives have invoked the former vice president and his political clout to further their private business dealings. It is the first that involves the Biden Cancer Initiative, a project Joe Biden made the centerpiece of his post-White House life following the death of his son  Beau . Biden’s brother,  James , made the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to  Michael Frey , CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden. At the time, James Biden’s business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records.” Sanders gives supporters the stage in Iowa -  Des Moines Register:  “As a Democratic candidate for president, [ Bernie ]  Sanders  frequently pushes his policies pugnaciously, framing them as moral imperatives as much as practical matters. But in his recent four-day swing through Iowa, he balanced his high-volume sermons with stories from his supporters. … Respondents who watched the September televised debate, where Sanders — who approached the debate stage with his typical fervor, but with a hoarse rasp — were more likely to have an unfavorable view of him. The debate-stage Sanders, whose style is described by some, including one of his 2020 rivals, as ""yelling"", was less present in his late September Iowa swing, Instead, Sanders often gave up the microphone to let others speak. … At his Iowa events, some of the personal stories are arranged in advance. But others are organic — hearing the stories of others inspires Sanders supporters to tell their own.” Biden leads the pack in Maryland -   Goucher College:  “The Goucher College Poll asked Maryland Democratic likely voters who they are currently planning to vote for in the Maryland Democratic presidential primary… Thirty-three percent of Maryland Democratic likely voters say they will vote for Joe Biden and 21 percent for Elizabeth Warren. Ten percent would vote for Bernie Sanders, 6 percent for  Kamala Harris , and 5 percent for  Pete Buttigieg . All other candidates earn support from 1 percent or fewer of voters. Fifteen percent have no preference or are undecided. … Mileah Kromer , director of the  Sarah T. Hughes  Field Politics Center at Goucher College [said,] ‘Democrats in Maryland are divided over whether they want a more moderate or progressive nominee and whether nominating a candidate who can defeat Trump or match their policy preferences is their top priority.’” ISSA TO CHALLENGE DUNCAN HUNTER NYT : “ Darrell Issa , the former nine-term congressman from California, will try to return to Congress by challenging Representative  Duncan Hunter , who was indicted last year, setting up a clash among two Trump allies for one of Republicans’ most endangered seats. Mr. Issa is expected to announce his challenge at a news conference on Thursday morning in the San Diego County district, according to two sources familiar with his decision. He had been publicly mulling for months whether to make a bid to return to Congress, and started an exploratory committee in August. ‘I have received such a tremendous outpouring of encouragement from supporters inside the district, and around the state and across the nation,’ Mr. Issa said in August in a statement posted to the committee’s website. Mr. Issa will likely bill himself to Republicans as a safer alternative than the incumbent.” Michigan announces new automatic voter registration -   MLive:  “Michigan took a leap forward into the modern era by announcing new voter registration policies on National Voter Registration Day.

"Pelosi announces plans to go forward; Mike Emanuel has the details. President Trump accused Democrats of ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"" moments after House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi,  D-Calif., publicly  announced Tuesday that there will be a formal impeachment inquiry  against him. The news comes on the heels of Trump's speech at the UN General Assembly in New York. ""Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage,"" Trump tweeted. ""So bad for our Country!"" PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP ""Pelosi, Nadler, Schiff and, of course, Maxine Waters!  Can you believe this? They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!"" ""The president must be held accountable,"" Pelosi said at a press conference late Tuesday. ""No one is above the law."" Democrats have long been threatening impeachment against Trump, even after Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded his nearly two-year investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, but Pelosi has been reluctant to formally open an inquiry, worrying that it would doom her caucus coming into the 2020 elections. ""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella."" Trump announced Tuesday that he will  release the full transcripts  of his July phone call with Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky  on Wednesday after a whistleblower alleged that Trump tried to convince the foreign leader to investigate former Vice President and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. ""Secretary of State Pompeo [received] permission from Ukraine Government to release the transcript of the telephone call I had with their President. They don’t know either what the big deal is. A total Witch Hunt Scam by the Democrats!"" Trump said. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP “Democrats can’t beat President Trump on his policies or his stellar record of accomplishment, so they’re trying to turn a Joe Biden scandal into a Trump problem,"" Trump's 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement to Fox News. ""The misguided Democrat impeachment strategy is meant to appease their rabid, extreme, leftist base, but will only serve to embolden and energize President Trump’s supporters and create a landslide victory for the President.”"
"The White House is making its own moves, making public a key telephone transcript and preparing to release to Congress a whistleblower's report as early as Wednesday, according to two sources familiar.  Politico first reported the White House's intention . One source told CNN the whistleblower report is under review and going through declassification and could be released within hours of the transcript release.  The investigation will test accusations that Trump sought to pressure a foreign power -- Ukraine -- into effectively intervening in the 2020 election to damage one of his possible Democratic opponents, former Vice President Joe Biden. ""The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said in a news conference. ""Therefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry."" Trump lamented the news in that it took the focus off his trip the United Nations General Assembly. ""Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!"" the President. Her decision elevates the turmoil and division whipped up by Trump's two-and-half years in power to historic proportions with massive political stakes for the 2020 election and beyond. Pelosi, after months of trying to slow walk impeachment demands from her liberal base, elected to strike, despite the  President agreeing to release a transcript on Wednesday  of a call with Ukraine's President. Trump says the document will clear him of wrongdoing despite his public admission that he pressured Ukraine to open an investigation into Biden and his son -- a fact in itself that his opponents argue is a gross abuse of power. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  Only two Presidents were impeached in the first 223 years of US history -- Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Now there is the possibility it could happen twice in the last 20 years, reflecting the fractured state of a nation split down the middle that has been further polarized by Trump's presidency. An impeachment inquiry would be the ultimate showdown between House Democrats who believe they were handed power in the midterm elections to constrain Trump, and a presidency that has repeatedly ripped democratic norms and tested the Constitution itself. Unfolding events Tuesday's developments unfolded at staggering speed in Washington and in New York where the President's ""America First"" speech to the United General Assembly was overshadowed. Trump decided to release the transcript under fierce political pressure over claims, first triggered by a whistleblower's complaint, that he threatened to withhold $400 million in military and security aid to force Kiev to open an investigation into his potential 2020 rival Biden and his son, Hunter. There is no evidence to support claims -- made in public by Trump as recently as Tuesday morning -- that the Bidens had corrupt dealings with the former Soviet Republic. At the United Nations, Trump put forward an alternative, retrospective justification for delaying aid to Ukraine ahead of his call to Zelensky on July 25. He said he wanted to wait for European nations to contribute their fair share.  Later, the President insisted in a tweet that his decision to provide the declassified, unredacted transcript -- opposed by senior aides -- would show that there was no quid pro quo offered to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!"" Trump tweeted. Some senior Democrats however insist that there need not be a quid pro quo for Trump to have committed a ""high crime and misdemeanor"" needed for a President to be impeached. The simple fact of a President asking a foreign leader to investigate a domestic political opponent is seen by many legal and political commentators as an abuse of power. Pelosi's strategy In an appearance in Washington, Pelosi warned: ""The President is making lawlessness a virtue in our country."" The House speaker did not specifically commit to an impeachment inquiry in the appearance and it's possible that the facts of the case will not merit, eventually, a full House vote on the question. But she shifted her position as a political torrent changed the shape of the impeachment debate in Washington. A number of moderate swing-state Democrats who she had been trying to protect, moved to the impeachment side of the argument. She said that the nature of Trump's alleged offense was clear -- a factor that might have changed the political equation. ""This is the most understandable by the public. And It's really important to know this. There is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation,"" she said. ""You don't ask foreign governments to help us in our election. That's what we try to stop with Russia. It's wrong."" Pelosi told her caucus that the impeachment would center around six House committees already investigating the President. It would be up to the Judiciary Committee eventually to decide whether to advance Articles of Impeachment. If the full House votes by simple majority to impeach a President his trial then takes place in the Senate. There is so far no suggestion, however, that staunch Republican support for Trump in the GOP controlled chamber is waning. That means the two-thirds majority that would be needed to convict the president on Articles of Impeachment and to oust him from office looks at this point unlikely to materialize. Like Pelosi, Biden also seems to be calculating his political position. As the subject of Trump's attacks and the Democratic front runner, he is in a unique position in the cascading drama. In an on camera appearance apparently meant to project presidential gravitas and temperament, the former vice president said that if Trump failed to provide information about the case, he would leave lawmakers with no choice. ""Denying Congress the information, which it is constitutionally entitled to, and obstructing its efforts to investigate actions is not the conduct of an American president. It's an abuse of power,"" Biden said. ""Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment. That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making,"" Biden said. Obstacles Democratic reluctance to move ahead with impeachment, despite what many in the party see as gross abuses of power revealed by special counsel Robert Mueller, has partly been based on fears of igniting Trump's base and causing a 2020 political backlash. Impeachment -- that can result in a democratic election being overturned -- is the most serious and consequential political maneuver available under the Constitution. It would tear at the fabric of the nation and trigger incalculable results and political forces that could reverberate for years. In another potentially enormous development, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff announced that the whistleblower who filed the complaint about Trump's conduct, wants to speak to the committee. The whistleblower has requested guidance from acting DNI Joseph Maguire on how to do so, Schiff said. Maguire had been under pressure from the White House and Justice Department not to turn over the whistleblower's complaint, but that appeared to change late Tuesday, so it was not clear how realistic are Democratic hopes of hearing the testimony. Trump made the decision to release the whistleblower complaint on Tuesday, a source familiar told CNN. It's unclear what is behind his change in position, though Pelosi told lawmakers she pressed Trump during a Tuesday phone call to release the complaint.  Two White House officials downplayed expectations for any bombshell revelation in the call transcript, saying it is expected to be ""underwhelming.""  One of the officials conceded that makes the release of the whistleblower complaint that much more important. But the official raised questions about the credibility of the the administration employee who filed the complaint about Trump's interactions with the Ukrainian President, referring to the employee as ""the so-called whistleblower."""

"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass.,  announced Saturday that he will mount a primary challenge to  Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass ., next year. The 38-year-old Kennedy -- the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy – formally announced his candidacy at a community center in Boston after weeks of rumors that he was mulling entering the race. AOC ENDORSES ED MARKEY, GREEN NEW DEAL CO-SPONSOR AHEAD OF POSSIBLE SENATE PRIMARY ""Donald Trump has forced a long overdue reckoning in America, and how we respond will say everything about who we are,"" Kennedy told supporters. ""We have to take on the broken system that gave rise to him in the first place — the outdated structures and old rules, the everyday oppressions and injustices that hold our people back.""

       Should Kennedy win, he would be the fourth Kennedy to serve in the Senate, joining his grandfather and his great-uncles John F. Kennedy, the 35th president, and Edward Kennedy. Edward Kennedy was the last member of the prestigious political family to run for Senate, winning election in 1962. The challenge to Markey, 73, is likely to leave local Democrats, including 2020 presidential hopeful and fellow Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., with a difficult choice of who to back. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,  has already endorsed Markey, with whom she has worked closely on the  Green New Deal  resolution introduced in Congress earlier this year. ""Ed Markey is a proud and strong progressive champion for working families -- not just in Massachusetts but across the country,"" she said last week.

       Markey, who joined thousands of young climate change activists who rallied in Boston on Friday as part of a global, youth-led day of environmental action, has the backing of many environmental activists. One of those groups — Environment Massachusetts — has vowed to raise $5 million to help Markey win re-election. Kennedy positioned himself as a more pragmatic Democrat when he was first elected to Congress in 2012, but has since adopted a series of left-wing stances. He has backed impeachment proceedings against President Trump, ""Medicare-for-all"" and the Green New Deal. In 2018, Kennedy gave the Democratic response to Trump's State of the Union address. Despite the blue-on-blue challenge, Kennedy has not yet moved to criticize Markey. ""Senator Markey is a good man,"" he said. ""This is going to be a tough race."" But Markey responded on Saturday by challenging Kennedy, along with other primary opponents, to a debate on how to respond to the question of climate change -- an issue he has been advocating on for decades. He proposed it be held in November. ""I was very disappointed at the Democratic National Committee's refusal to hold a debate on climate change for our presidential candidates,"" Markey said in a video message. ""So today I'm challenging Congressman Joe Kennedy, Shannon Liss-Riordan and Steve Pemberton to a climate change debate, and to do it very soon."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “For the next generation, we can’t wait,” he said. Liss-Riordan, a workers' rights lawyer, and Pemberton, a former senior executive at Walgreens, are also challenging Markey. The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"""The president asked a foreign power to help him win an election. Again,"" the former secretary of state tweeted, referring to Trump's call during the 2016 race for Russia to look into Clinton's deleted emails. Clinton's tweet included a video of  Giuliani's comments on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time""  Thursday, when Chris Cuomo pressed the former New York mayor over conversations he'd had with a  Ukrainian official  about Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who had investigated the former vice president's son, Hunter. ""Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?"" Cuomo asked Giuliani.  ""No, actually I didn't. I asked the Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016 by the Ukrainians for the benefit of Hillary Clinton, for which there is already a court finding,"" Giuliani responded. ""You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden and his role with the prosecutor?"" Cuomo asked. ""The only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that (Yuriy) Lutsenko, who was appointed, dismissed the case,"" Giuliani said. ""So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?"" Cuomo pressed. ""Of course I did,"" Giuliani said. When asked about his contradicting answer, Giuliani said he ""didn't ask"" for Biden to be investigated specifically, but asked Ukraine ""to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme."" Asked Friday if he discussed the former vice president with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed"" but that someone should look into Biden. During the 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump called on Russia, China and other hackers to turn over Clinton's emails. ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump said in July 2016.  Then-White House press secretary  Sean Spicer later said Trump was ""joking""  when he publicly asked Russia to hack his Democratic rival."
"He had felt confident after phoning Pelosi earlier that morning. The drive for impeachment in her caucus had ramped up amid reports  he pushed the Ukrainian President to investigate Joe Biden , and Trump was hoping to head off a clash. He figured he could de-escalate tensions by speaking with her directly.  It was after that call that  Trump made the decision to release an ""unredacted"" version of the transcript  of his July call -- against the advice of aides such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who warned him it would set a risky precedent. Trump wanted to undercut the argument from Democrats that he acted inappropriately, he said, and felt he had nothing to hide.  But when the announcement he would release the transcript did little to quell the growing calls for his impeachment, Trump was in disbelief.  Democrats immediately argued that it wouldn't be enough.  They also wanted to see the whistleblower's complaint , which had been found urgent and credible by the inspector general for the intelligence community and was mandated by law to be handed over to the intelligence committees. Administration officials began working out a plan to declassify and redact the complaint so it could be turned over too, all in the hope of easing escalated tensions with lawmakers.  After Pelosi's historic announcement, Trump immediately began lashing out, accusing Democrats of distracting from his successes at the United Nations General Assembly and arguing it was just ""more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage.""  But people close to him said he is not welcoming this impeachment fight. The President who keeps a careful watch on his approval numbers was unhappy.  A source close to the White House who routinely speaks with Trump confirmed he does not want to be impeached. Despite the argument that it could help him politically, Trump, according to the source, has worried about the possibility of being impeached for nearly a year, dating back to the weeks that followed the November 2018 midterms when Democrats won the House. This also isn't the first time Trump has misread Pelosi. He also told aides he wasn't that worried when Democrats won the House after the 2018 midterms because he thought they would be easier to work with than some of the Republicans he had been forced to deal with, like former House Speaker Paul Ryan. Six committees are now investigating Trump, ranging from his tax returns to his policies in office.  Aides and allies of the President plan to argue that Democrats have wildly overreached here. "
"President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani on his conversation with Ukraine officials. President Trump ’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani aimed to clarify what he said in a recent  CNN  interview about his involvement with Ukraine investigating Joe Biden's son Hunter, after the network’s Chris Cuomo accused him of contradicting himself. Giuliani first said no when Cuomo asked if he urged Ukraine to investigate Biden, saying instead that he asked the country to investigate allegations of election interference by Ukraine for the benefit of Hillary Clinton. He later said he did ask Ukraine to investigate a newly appointed prosecutor. Cuomo replied, “So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?” and Giuliani responded, “Of course I did.” When Cuomo called out the apparent contradiction, Giuliani followed up, “No. I didn't ask them to look into Joe Biden. I asked them to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme.” TRUMP: CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ‘WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT,’ TOUCHED ON CORRUPTION, OTHER ISSUES “The no was obviously wrong, I corrected it immediately,” Giuliani said  on “Fox News Sunday,”  adding, “I corrected it before he corrected it. The reality is, the distinction is this: What they’re saying is, I went there for, on a political mission, to kind of get Joe Biden in trouble. Ridiculous. I went there as a lawyer defending his client.” Hunter Biden had been the subject of an investigation by Ukrainian authorities based on his business dealings with energy company Burisma. Giuliani said the case was dropped only after then-Vice President Biden got the prosecutor fired and then had influence over the selection of his replacement. “You don’t get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country unless something fishy’s going on,” Giuliani said. He explained that his original purpose in going to Ukraine was to look into election interference, not the Bidens, but the two matters were “inextricably combined,” so one led to the other. “This is going to get bigger and bigger, and everything I say I can prove.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden has denied any wrongdoing, although he publicly said in the past that he threatened to withhold $1 billion from Ukraine if they did not fire the prosecutor. That prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, already had been facing allegations of corruption. It was reported last week that during a July phone call, Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to work with Giuliani in investigating the Bidens. Trump  fought back  Sunday, telling reporters he “said absolutely nothing wrong.” Fox News' John Roberts contributed to this report."
"When McCain was asked if Democrats have a chance to win Arizona in 2020, she said she ""really can"" see the southwestern state going blue.  ""We have, on my side of the aisle, on the Republican side, we see a local party in Arizona that's not functioning well. And it's excluding people. And it's excluding people for the wrong reasons,"" McCain said in an interview  for Politico's ""Women Rule"" podcast . ""If you're not walking the line, then you're out. That's just not right. That's not the party that my husband and I belonged to."" John McCain, whose career in Washington spanned decades, cultivated a reputation for occasionally opposing Republicans. In the last years of his life, he was a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, particularly over foreign policy, and Trump  occasionally criticized  the late Arizona senator, even after his passing. ""I think we've seen the end of men like my husband,"" Cindy McCain said on the podcast. ""At least for right now ... there's lots of good people in the Senate and the House but I just don't see anyone bubbling up to the kind of quality my husband had."" ""The inability to even discuss issues -- differing issues -- it's degenerated into name-calling and Twitter responses, and all of these things that not only do they not help the argument, but they don't help foster good relationships with people.""

"In a letter to McConnell on Monday, Schumer writes that he is calling on the majority leader and Senate Republicans who control the chamber to ""take immediate action to stop President Trump from withholding an Intelligence Community whistleblower complaint that by law must be transmitted to Congress, and to begin an investigation into the Administration's handling of security assistance to Ukraine.""  Schumer calls for hearings ""to determine exactly what prompted the whistleblower to file this urgent complaint,"" and says they should feature testimony from a host of administration officials, including acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Schumer also calls for testimony from Trump's private attorney Rudy Giuliani.  Schumer also states that a subpoena should be issued ""to compel the delivery of the whistleblower complaint to Congress, as required by law.""  The letter is the latest effort by congressional Democratic leaders to push for an investigation into the whistleblower complaint amid a controversy surrounding Trump and his contact with Ukraine.  McConnell addressed the whistleblower complaint in remarks on the Senate floor on Monday afternoon and accused Schumer of politicizing the issue.  ""The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has long worked on a bipartisan basis in secure settings out of the public spotlight, to conduct critically important oversight of classified and sensitive matters,"" the Senate GOP leader said. ""So, I've been disappointed to see our colleague, the Democratic leader, choose to politicize the committee's ongoing efforts with respect to a recent whistleblower allegation, the specific subject of which is still unknown.""  McConnell went on to say that ""Chairman Burr and Vice chairman Warner have been working together to get the acting director of intelligence and the intelligence community's inspector general before the committee this week to discuss the matter,"" referring to Republican Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the committee. McConnell said that it is important that the work be handled ""in a secure setting"" and in a ""bipartisan fashion.""  Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden in a July call with Ukraine's president. CNN  has previously reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son Hunter. Schumer's letter calls on Senate Republicans to demand that the White House release the transcript of the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian President. It also asks that Trump administration officials be identified ""who directed that $341 million of security assistance to Ukraine be delayed.""  The letter from the Senate Democratic leader comes after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  called over the weekend  for the whistleblower to come before Congress.  Maguire is set to testify in open session before the House intelligence committee on Thursday.  In a letter to House Democrats, Pelosi wrote, ""At that time, we expect him to obey the law and turn over the whistleblower's full complaint to the Committee.  We also expect that he will establish a path for the whistleblower to speak directly to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as required by law."" Pelosi warned in the letter, however, that ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation."" More senators weigh in on whistleblower controversy Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told CNN on Monday that he hopes that he will have a chance to speak with the whistleblower, but would not weigh in on Trump's contacts with the Ukrainian President. ""I would like the whistleblower to come and talk to me so I know what his story is,"" Grassley said when asked if the complaint should be turned over to Congress. ""I don't want to hear it second hand."" When asked if it is an appropriate use of Trump's office to talk to Ukraine's president about the Bidens, the GOP senator sidestepped the question, saying, ""I think through the news media maybe you can get the whistleblower to come and talk to us.""  Warner would not say if he believes that it's an impeachable offense if Trump urged Ukraine to probe Biden in exchange for releasing military aid.  ""What I want to do is get the truth first,"" Warner said, adding that he wants a probe done in a bipartisan way. ""We need to get the facts.""

"Democrats officially move to impeach based on whistleblower complaint. One of the most bewildering facts of our current moment is how quickly  everything  moves. For example, remember the latest  New York Times hit piece on Brett Kavanaugh ? The one where they found a brand new accusation of sexual misconduct, but then later had to admit it was all a sham? When did that happen? It feels like about a year ago, but actually, no, it was just last week. That's the Trump-era news cycle for you. Scandals that used to go on for months now seem to end in hours. Nothing illustrates that better than this  bizarre Ukraine story  that we're all living through. NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMS FEAR BLOWBACK FROM IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: REPORT So, a week ago, no one had even heard of it. By Tuesday night, we were on the brink of  impeachment  because of it. And now, it seems to be over already. Just to bring you back and remind you what just happened: the same angry news anchors who brought you  Stormy Daniels  and the  Russia hoax  now wanted you to know that Big Orange's days in the White House were finally over. Why? Because Trump, they said, threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine. And it's essential that we send military aid to Ukraine for some reason. But Trump was going to withhold it unless they did something bad to  Joe Biden  and his family. Basically, it was an extortion plot against Ukraine, and that's a crime, the news anchors shouted. A crime! Trump was finished! Well, Wednesday morning, they turned out to be wrong. Actual evidence emerged. And it contradicted what they told us yesterday. The administration released a  transcript  of the president's phone call with Ukrainian head of state, and it  shows none of the things that news anchors claimed  it would show.  Read it for yourself , don't trust us. It's right online. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Try to find the extortion in there; there isn't any. Trump never even mentions military aid. Well, yes, they're saying now, but he asked a foreign government to investigate an American citizen and that is immoral. OK. Was it immoral when three Democratic senators wrote a letter to Ukraine just last year, demanding investigations into Trump? No answer on that question. Well, we will tell you if we hear back. Instead, now they're telling us that the transcript of the phone call can't be real. It must be doctored.  Chuck Schumer  and  Adam Schiff  spun their conspiracy theory on Tuesday night. Chris Hayes, MSNBC host: Do you trust the White House enough to take that transcript and believe that that is an actual representation of what transpired? Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.: Well, you know, I think, sadly, it is the case as you described that we cannot trust the administration with respect to anything that it produces. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.: Simply to release the transcript is not going to come close to ending the need of the American public and the Congress to see what actually happened. So again, that was last night, before the transcript was publicly available. Now that it is publicly available for Adam Schiff's conspiracy addled brain, it has lurched in a different direction. Now he is telling us that the transcript, the one that he has already denounced as fake, is, in fact, real. But it doesn't show what it should show -- which is to say it doesn't show President Trump doing any of the things that supposedly justify impeachment. Why? Well, Adam Schiff explains because the president, like a Navajo code talker, is speaking in secret code. If we're talking about Ukraine and impeachment, we're talking about Joe Biden's alleged corruption. That can't help his campaign for president. In fact, it's likely to tank it. It looks like sabotage, really. ""This is how a mafia boss talks,"" Schiff told reporters. ""What have you done for us? We've done so much for you. But there's not much reciprocity. I have a favor I want to ask you. And what is that favor? Of course, the favor is to investigate his political rival. A classic mafia-like shakedown a foreign leader."" So, you know, we're not psychiatrists here. But honestly, Adam Schiff is a nut case. It's true. It's hard to believe he is in Congress. Poor people of Anaheim, or wherever he is from -- Southern California, the Valley somewhere. It's hard to believe he is actually in Congress. He is actually a committee chairman, believe it or not. Too bad the 25th Amendment doesn't apply to members of Congress. But to be fair, most Democrats are not anywhere near as crazy as Adam Schiff, not even the same ballpark. They're just very cynical -- extremely cynical -- more cynical you've ever thought of being. For example, this is illustrated when Congressman Al Green, who is not stupid or crazy, explains what's actually driving impeachment against Trump. Interviewer: Are you concerned that impeachment talk may actually help the president's reelection? Rep. Al Green, D-Texas: I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get reelected. ""I'm concerned if we don't impeach, he will get reelected."" I'm concerned that democracy could happen. We've got to stop that. It's about power. Duh. You knew that. That's what it's always about, power. Nobody pushing for impeachment actually cares about secret deals with foreign leaders. Oh, please. Much less justice or the truth. Again, these are the most cynical people in the United States of America. What they care about -- and you knew this already -- was winning the  2020 presidential election . That's all they care about. Getting their mitts on the levers of power and exercising power for its own sake. That's what drives them. That's why they get up in the morning. Democratic leaders have decided that impeaching Trump is essential if they're going to win next year. So they're staking everything on this bizarre, flimsy scandal that the rest of us can barely even understand. Will it work? Probably not. If personal attacks on Trump are effective -- if calling him a racist or a traitor actually worked -- then  Hillary Clinton  would be running for reelection right about now. That is not going to work. It never works. If you want to impeach Trump, make a case on the issues. He won on the issues. Make a counter case. The geniuses can't figure that out. In the end, the real loser here in this impeachment nonsense is likely to be Joe Biden. Biden, you'll recall, is the frontrunner, supposedly. He is supposed to be the safe choice, the guy who is going to energize the Obama coalition and win back the White House. And yet now Democrats have, in effect, demanded that we  spend the next six months talking about Biden and his son's alleged corruption  because that's at the core of this Ukraine story. If we're talking about Ukraine and impeachment, we're talking about Joe Biden's alleged corruption. That can't help his campaign for president. In fact, it's likely to tank it. It looks like sabotage, really. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP They must have gamed this out. They must know. Is it sabotage? Well, honestly, we don't know. We're not in the room. Maybe it is. Or maybe Democrats have just become so obsessed with destroying  Donald Trump , that they're destroying themselves accidentally.

"In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour outside of the United Nations, Gore said ""there is no evidence ... of any credible accusation against (Biden).""  ""The facts being laid out on President Trump's conversation with the head of Ukraine must be investigated thoroughly,"" he continued. ""And this latest accusation, like some of the others, falls into a rare category. The only remedy is an impeachment investigation."" The controversy surrounding a phone call  Trump acknowledged  having with Ukraine's president about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden in July has rekindled talk among Democrats about a potential impeachment movement.  CNN previously reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to  investigate Biden's son , according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of  a whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.  There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. When asked if he thought an impeachment investigation against Trump should happen, Gore said the latest controversy gives ""new impetus"" to congressional Democrats' first stage in investigating whether there should be impeachment proceedings. ""There's a difference between an investigation to see if there should be a formal impeachment and the formal impeachment itself. They're in the first stage now. But this really gives new impetus to that,"" he said.  Gore continued: ""It all depends on what the truth is, but they must find the truth. Because, were it to be true, and not addressed, it would normalize the most obscene and outrageous behavior, threaten the rule of law and the promise of democracy and self-governance. That much is at stake."" House Democrats have said they are a close to a  ""tipping point""  on an impeachment investigation into Trump.

"In public, for the last five days,  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  and his campaign have been on a ferocious offensive, ripping into President Trump for allegedly abusing his powers in asking Ukraine’s leader to help hurt  Mr. Biden  politically, and castigating the news media for questioning his son Hunter Biden’s financial dealings there. On Tuesday, Mr. Biden made his biggest move yet, saying Congress should start an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump if he does not cooperate with their investigations. In private, though, this has been an enraging and uncertain time for the Biden campaign, and for Mr. Biden himself, who associates say has been astounded both by Mr. Trump’s contact with the Ukrainian government and his obvious enthusiasm for attacking Mr. Biden’s family. He and his advisers have long feared that  Hunter Biden  would become a target for political opponents, according to people familiar with their thinking, and now the scrutiny of Mr. Biden’s son is bound to intensify. And as Mr. Trump’s onslaught has pushed the House of Representatives to start  an impeachment inquiry , Mr. Biden now faces a crucial political test where his standing may hinge on how he handles a wildly unpredictable confrontation with Mr. Trump. Bryce Smith, the Democratic Party chairman in Dallas County, Iowa, said the moment showcased Mr. Biden as a candidate Mr. Trump is “genuinely worried about” and offered a reminder of the lengths Mr. Trump may go to oppose any Democratic opponent. But it also exposed Mr. Biden to risks in the leadoff caucus state, he said. “I could see people who are already on the fence about him, maybe because of his long career in politics, his age, his ability to win this, kind of going, ‘Oh, great, we’re already starting this and he hasn’t even gotten the nomination,’” Mr. Smith said. “And others going, ‘He’s obviously being thought of as a formidable opponent, if Trump is thinking about it like this.’” Mr. Biden and his campaign team have encouraged the latter interpretation, trying to project an image of strength in the primary and warning the press that the Biden campaign would deliver blunt criticism about coverage it sees as unfair. At a Philadelphia fund-raising event on Monday, Mr. Biden pledged, “I’m not going to take a punch and not punch back.” Yet allies of Mr. Biden acknowledge privately that the campaign has been girding for months for criticism of Hunter Biden, who has charted a winding career as a bank executive, lobbyist and financier, often operating in parts of the private sector that overlapped with his father’s footprint in government. They have declined to say whether they vetted Hunter Biden’s business activities as part of preparing for the 2020 presidential campaign, arguing that the political world should be solely focused on Mr. Trump’s conduct. Image President Trump in New York on Tuesday. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times There is no evidence that Mr. Biden, as vice president, intentionally tried to help his son in his dealings with Ukraine, but Hunter Biden’s business career has sporadically drawn attention from political rivals and the media for more than a decade. Associates say Mr. Biden is infuriated by Mr. Trump’s conduct and astonished by the president’s willingness to dismiss some of the most basic ethical lines in American politics.    In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president’s actions an “abuse of power’’ that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations.  In some respects, Mr. Trump’s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden’s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share. At fund-raisers and other events, Democrats who have spoken with Mr. Biden in recent days say he has largely appeared measured, greeting old friends in his typical effusive style and keeping the focus on his concerns with Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, rather than dwelling on the challenges the moment raises for his family. Still unclear in this moment of crisis is what conclusions Democratic voters might make about Mr. Biden as an opponent for Mr. Trump, and how a drive for impeachment in Congress might shape the Democratic primary campaign. Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, who saw Mr. Biden at a fund-raiser in Iowa on Saturday, said he believed that Mr. Trump’s dangerous conduct was at the forefront of Mr. Biden’s mind. “I suspect he’s just as focused and just as concerned about that as he is about an attack on a family member, as personal as that is,” said Mr. Vilsack, who served as agriculture secretary in the Obama administration. A memo circulated to political surrogates from the Biden campaign on Tuesday urged supporters to note that “this isn’t about Biden or his family. We all know who Trump is,” and also suggested criticizing reporters for giving undeserved coverage to Mr. Trump’s attacks on Mr. Biden and his son. “Trump is successfully playing the same game he played in 2016 — and the press is falling for it again,” the memo stated. This clash has come at a precarious moment for Mr. Biden’s candidacy, as he seeks to recover momentum after a largely limp summer on the campaign trail. He has slipped in the polls over the last two months and faces an increasingly formidable challenge from Senator Elizabeth Warren: Two polls released in recent days showed her slightly overtaking him in  Iowa  and  New Hampshire , the leadoff states in the Democratic nomination process. In the short term, at least, Mr. Trump may have effectively put Hunter Biden off limits for his father’s Democratic rivals. It is unlikely that any other candidate in Mr. Biden’s party would soon follow Mr. Trump in going after the former vice president’s son on the subject of business ethics, while Mr. Trump may face an impeachment inquiry for allegedly pressuring a foreign government to do just that. Senator Bernie Sanders, for one, deflected a reporter’s question on Tuesday about whether he thought the sudden focus on Hunter Biden’s overseas work would weaken the Biden campaign. “You guys write very perceptive articles on these things, and I’ll let you make that judgment,” he replied. It is unclear, however, how well prepared Mr. Biden and his campaign may be to address questions about Hunter Biden’s business dealings beyond the specific case Mr. Trump has attempted to raise. Hunter Biden has operated for years in parts of the business world that intersected with his father’s career in government, including working for MBNA, a Delaware-based bank, while his father was involved in rewriting the bankruptcy code as a senator, and leading an investment fund that did business in foreign countries   while his father was vice president. Hunter Biden’s work for MBNA briefly became an issue during his father’s campaign for the vice presidency in 2008, and Obama-Biden campaign officials  defended it  as within the bounds of ethical propriety. TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, said the former vice president was indeed angry that Mr. Trump was “lying about his family, and now appears to be blackmailing a foreign government into helping legitimize those lies.”  “He’s fighting back, which is what Democrats want to see in their nominee and why he will beat Donald Trump next fall,” Mr. Ducklo said, adding, “The V.P. and his family know Donald Trump plays dirty, and they can take it.” Mr. Ducklo declined to say whether the campaign had vetted Hunter Biden’s business dealings and said the media should not be asking questions like that. “We’re not going to indulge Trump’s conspiracy theories, and we’re not going to dignify his attacks with a response,” he said. Mr. Biden is said to have limited patience for discussing Hunter Biden’s apparent political vulnerabilities, even in private. Some of Mr. Biden’s close advisers have argued in private settings that going after any member of Mr. Biden’s family — including Hunter Biden — would ultimately backfire on an opponent, because of Mr. Biden’s stature and the sympathetic feelings much of the public has for him and his family. For Mr. Biden, the matter of his son is deeply sensitive for reasons that have nothing to do with politics: While the whole Biden family endorsed his choice to enter the 2020 race, friends of Mr. Biden said consistently throughout his deliberations that his deepest anxiety was the impact of a campaign on a family still grappling with profound loss after the death of Mr. Biden’s elder son, Beau Biden, in 2015, from brain cancer. “I know that he worked through that, he did a lot of contemplation about how it would affect the family,” said the Rev. Joseph Darby, an influential South Carolina-based pastor who has known Mr. Biden for years. Earlier this year, Hunter Biden  spoke in detail  to The New Yorker magazine about the crippling grief he experienced after his brother’s death, and his long-running struggles with drug addiction. The magazine story also detailed a number of potential ethical conflicts in Hunter Biden’s business activities and described the vice president as having dealt “with Hunter’s activities by largely ignoring them.”  Maggie Astor and Sydney Ember contributed reporting.

"""Special Report"" anchor  Bret Baier  said Wednesday morning that House Democrats will argue that an ""implied "" quid pro quo is evident  in the transcript  of President Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Reacting on  ""America's Newsroom""  to the release of the transcript of the call, which is based on ""notes and recollections"" of those who heard the conversation, Baier said Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden appears to have been made right after Zelensky mentioned the planned purchase of Javelin anti-tank missiles from the United States. “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,"" Trump said, according to  the transcript . READ THE UKRAINE CALL MEMO HOUSE DEMOCRAT WHO ENDORSED BIDEN SAYS IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO 'CLEAR UP' QUESTIONS ON SON'S UKRAINE DEALINGS Baier noted that House Democrats have not moved forward to a vote on impeachment, but many on the left will likely argue that a quid pro quo is ""implied"" by the president in the conversation. ""They will say that that conversation that preceded it is implied. Is that going to be the moment that gets a vote on an impeachment article? Obviously Nancy Pelosi doesn't think so yet. She hasn't moved to vote to authorize an inquiry,"" he said. In the days before the call, Trump reportedly ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine, a detail that fueled impeachment calls leading to House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi  announcing a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday. Democrats have argued Trump may have been using the military aid as leverage to push Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings, though the White House has denied that. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,” Trump said in the phone call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.” The document does not show Trump explicitly leveraging military aid as part of a quid pro quo. The memo begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory, before Trump eventually broaches the subject of the Bidens, telling Zelensky he wanted his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr to get involved.

"White House provides unredacted text of President Trump's phone call with Ukraine's new leader Volodymyr Zelensky. Critics of President Trump are being accused of moving the goalposts following  Wednesday’s release of the transcript of a call  with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that  does not show  Trump dangling American military aid in return for a Ukrainian probe of Joe Biden. In  pressing forward with a formal impeachment  inquiry, Democrats claimed Trump had frozen $400 million in aid to Ukraine to pressure officials into pursuing a Biden investigation. Democratic lawmakers and liberal pundits urged Trump to release the transcript of his controversial call, and he obliged with a CIA-drafted memorandum of the conversation. The document does not show Trump explicitly leveraging military aid as part of a quid pro quo. But critics cited several concerns -- including that the document did not reflect a ""verbatim transcript"" and that a related whistleblower complaint still has not been made public. STEPHANIE GRISHAM SAYS REPORTERS USED WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFINGS TO ‘GET FAMOUS’ NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News that “the stampede of excuses” surrounding the transcript doesn’t surprise him, as mainstream pundits shift the criteria needed to impeach the president. “One of the most time-honored traditions in the liberal media is the moving of the goalposts when their adversaries and/or enemies do the very thing they've been asking for,” Houck said. “One of the most time-honored traditions in the liberal media is the moving of the goalposts when their adversaries and/or enemies do the very thing they've been asking for."" CNN’s Pamela Brown immediately told viewers the transcript didn’t reveal “explicit quid pro quo” but featured a disclaimer that it isn’t necessarily a “verbatim” transcript. “This is just one part of the whistleblower complaint surrounding President Trump. It is not the full picture,” Brown said. TRUMP SLAMS CNN’S ACOSTA FOR PRESS CONFERENCE PERFORMANCE: ‘YOU ARE A RUDE, TERRIBLE PERSON’ “The president has a way of asking without asking,” CNN’s Gloria Borger said when explaining the lack of quid pro quo. “He did say, ‘I’d like you to do me a favor.' I think that’s kind of an ask, don’t you?” CNN’s Jeffrey Toobin then said, “Let’s be clear that quid pro quo is not necessary for this phone call to be widely inappropriate and potentially impeachable.” Over on MSNBC, correspondent Julia Ainsley noted the ellipsis in the transcript. “There’s a dot-dot-dot and I asked, ‘Is there something we’re not getting there?’ I couldn’t get an answer to that, whether or not it was just a pause in the call or something they left out,"" Ainsley said. ""Typically, if they leave it out, they would redact it. But there is a lot of questions about what he is implying here.” NYT REPORTERS BEHIND KAVANAUGH STORY GRILLED ON ‘THE VIEW,’ BLAME ‘OVERSIGHT’ BY GRAY LADY EDITORS MSNBC then brought on former Obama staffer Ned Price to declare the call was “worse” than he thought it would be. “The whole game here is the mention of Vice President Biden and his son. It was really a binary, either he did or he didn’t,” Price said. “To see it in this call memorandum is really striking.” Harvard’s Nieman Journalism Lab director  Joshua Benton determined  that the transcript reveals 66 words were spoken per minute, which he says is “quite slow” and suggests text was omitted. Others harped on the word “transcript” being used to describe the summary of Trump’s phone call, so much that ""not a transcript"" became a trending topic on Twitter. NBC, COMCAST SILENT ON LAWRENCE O’DONNELL’S RETRACTED REPORT THAT BYPASSED MSNBC’S VERIFICATION PROCESS “This clearly IS NOT a transcript… we have to refrain from calling it a verbatim transcript,” CNN’s Brian Karem  tweeted . ""We've been lied to -- again."" “No Things Considered” host Tim Young pointed out that the goalposts were moved twice regarding the Trump-Ukraine call. READ THE UKRAINE CALL MEMO “At first we had to see the transcript of the call. Now we have seen it and it vindicates the president. Then they said we had to see the whistleblower complaint, which we will see, and it will also vindicate the president. All the Democrats and the media can do is move the goalposts,” conservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News. “If they had any decency, they would apologize for getting this so utterly wrong. Alas, decency means nothing when you are all-in on yet another provable lie to the American people.” DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall told Fox News that mainstream media coverage of the Ukraine controversy has “been thoroughly saturated by partisanship and speculation” despite facts being sparse prior to the transcript being released. TRUMP RIPS NEW YORK TIMES OVER KAVANAUGH PIECE, CALLS FOR RESIGNATION OF ANYONE INVOLVED IN 'SMEAR STORY'   “Reporters who might want to challenge the accuracy of the transcripts should make sure there is evidence to support any challenges as they go forward,” McCall said. “Sadly, most media outlets have already decided which direction their coverage will take them, either to support the impeachment parade or throw cold water on it. And any facts one way or the other won't necessarily change the direction.” “Sadly, most media outlets have already decided which direction their coverage will take them, either to support the impeachment parade or throw cold water on it, and any facts one way or the other won't necessarily change the direction.” The process of moving the goalposts began on Tuesday before the transcripts were even released when MSNBC’s Chris Hayes and CNN’s Jake Tapper responded to Trump announcing he would release the full transcript of the call. Hayes and Tapper pre-emptively raised doubts about the transcript's veracity “Given what we know about how Trump pressures and manipulates civil servants to toe his line, I'm not *quite* sure we can trust the transcript itself as being accurate/comprehensive,” Hayes  tweeted . Tapper took it further, reminding CNN viewers of “two important caveats” about the transcript. “One, this is a White House that has falsified information before, from showing a doctored hurricane map to promoting a video that an outside group altered of a CNN reporter,"" Tapper said. ""So who knows if this transcript will actually be complete? Second, the whistleblower’s complaint about Trump is about more than just that one phone call."" CNN’s Brian Stelter  even reminded viewers that former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen once  said the president “speaks in code… like a mob boss” to prepare for a lack of quid pro quo in the transcript. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “This White House lost the benefit of the doubt a long time ago,” Stelter said before the transcript was released. People took to Twitter with their thoughts on the goalposts being altered: Fox News’ Alex Pappas contributed to this report."
"""Everybody does it,"" Trump said Monday. That blasé attitude is not reflected in Congress, where the weekend's revelations have led more Democrats to support an impeachment inquiry against Trump. The worst possible scenario, which not everybody believes, is that Trump used his office and his authority over foreign aid to stir up trouble for a leading 2020 rival.  But the political fight is over more than just whether Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, to get involved in the US presidential election by investigating Biden and his son, Hunter, over Hunter's former business interests. It's also about what must be shared with Congress after a whistleblower raised the alarm, and just how much Trump has changed what's allowed in American politics. ""I'm leading in the polls, they have no idea how they stop me,"" Trump told reporters Tuesday at the United Nations. ""The only way they can try is through impeachment."" This is a fast moving scandal that's hard to keep track of. Here's what we know about each of the issues at hand: Did Trump talk to Ukraine's new president about Joe Biden? Yes.  Trump initially denied it, but over the weekend admitted  that when he talked to Zelensky on July 25, he brought up Joe Biden. Trump also made clear that in his mind, Biden = corruption.  On Sunday, Trump said of the conversation: ""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption),"" Trump told reporters. The call is part of the whistleblower complaint against Trump. The Wall Street Journal  reported  Friday that Trump told Zelensky ""that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know"" whether allegations were true or not, a person familiar with the matter said, according to the Journal. While Trump pressed Zelensky, he did not bring up military aid on the call, CNN reported Friday. Mr. Giuliani is former New York mayor and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who has been calling for months for a new inquiry into Biden's role in a corruption purge in Ukraine during the Obama administration. He renewed those calls during a remarkable  interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo last Thursday during which he said he asked officials in Ukraine to investigate Biden. Why is anyone suggesting Trump pressured Zelensky or tied a Biden investigation to military aid? At the same time Trump was mentioning Biden to Zelensky, Giuliani was actively pushing Ukraine's top prosecutor, who has since left that position, to officially investigate Biden and his son. That's also about the same time Trump's administration was putting the skids on nearly $400 million aid, including $250 million in military aid and $141 million from the State Department, US officials familiar with the matter tell CNN. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said on Twitter last week that after he met recently with Zelensky, there was no question the Ukrainian was concerned both about the aid being cut off and about Giuliani's calls for an investigation in Biden. ""Zelensky did not explicitly connect the two in our meeting, but he was VERY concerned about the cut off of aid, and VERY aware of the conversations that Rudy Giuliani was having with his team. I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump's campaign operatives. He agreed,"" Murphy explained in a series of tweets. An aide to Zelensky, Andriy Yermak, summed up his contacts with Giuliani in an interview published Monday. ""So, Giuliani and I talked on the phone, and after that we personally met in Madrid. I repeated to him the same points. He noted that it was important for him to hear that the new Ukrainian government would preach the principles of openness and legality, will fight corruption, and set as its goal to make Ukraine successful."" Who is Zelensky? Zelensky is a former comedian, and like Trump, a newcomer to politics. Before his election in April, he was better known as the star of a TV show in which he  played the President of Ukraine . When he won a landslide victory over Petro Poroshenko, he promised to clean up corruption. Did Zelensky feel pressured by Trump to investigate Biden? There are conflicting accounts on this. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said over the weekend that his country would not take sides in a US election. ""I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,"" he told the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske,  according to Reuters . ""This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers."" Did Trump directly tie military aid to Ukraine to investigating Biden? We don't entirely know. It does not appear Trump ever explicitly told Zelensky that if he didn't investigate Biden, he wouldn't get the military aid. There is a transcript of the call, but it's not clear if or when anyone outside the White House will see it. Some details of the call have been reported,  including by CNN . ""I did not make a statement that 'you have to do this or I'm not going to give you aid.' I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that,"" Trump told reporters on Monday.  He also suggested it's his hope the call's transcript is released: ""It was a very nice call. I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon."" When was the military aid to Ukraine frozen? CNN confirmed that Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on the millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before a call with Zelensky, two senior administration officials said on Monday. Officials from the Office of Management and Budget told officials from the Pentagon and State Department about the freeze at a meeting in mid-July, according to  The Washington Post . When and how were the funds frozen? Trump admitted he withheld the money in comments to reporters at the UN Tuesday. He said he wanted Europe to do more for Ukraine. But then he added the money was ultimately paid. He didn't point out it was ultimately paid because of an objection from Democrats. ""My complaint has always been -- and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,"" he said. Because they not doing it, it's the United States. We're putting up the bulk of the money. Mulvaney has long been skeptical of the aid. Former national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not agree on much, but they did agree that Ukraine should get the aid. Congressional staffers say Congress was in the dark on the holdup. ""The administration did not notify us that the aid was frozen,"" according to a Senate aide. ""The House Appropriations Committee learned of it on or about August 23rd and informed us, and then the first news stories appeared days later. In response to our inquiries, DoD confirmed to us that the funds were frozen on August 28th."" Further, according to CNN reporting, officials in Ukraine were never formally told the funds were being frozen. Why does Trump keep returning to Biden and Ukraine?  Politics. Trump wants to attack Biden's credibility. Every time Trump is asked about his conversation with Zelensky, he returns to his message about Biden, as he did on Twitter Monday. ""Now the Fake News Media says I 'pressured the Ukrainian President at least 8 times during my telephone call with him.' This supposedly comes from a so-called 'whistleblower' who they say doesn't even have a first hand account of what was said. More Democrat/Crooked Media con.......Breaking News: The Ukrainian Government just said they weren't pressured at all during the 'nice' call. Sleepy Joe Biden, on the other hand, forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine. That's the real story!"" An important note: There have been no serious allegations of specific wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. An investigation into a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board, had been shelved by a prosecutor before Biden and many other Western officials and Ukrainians called for him to step down.  Biden had threatened aid in the form of loan guarantees  if the prosecutor did not leave office. When did Trump's focus on Biden and Ukraine start? This is a story that has been percolating for some time. Giuliani has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden's call in 2016 to remove the country's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating the natural gas company connected to Hunter Biden. CNN reported in August that Giuliani and Yermak, the aide to Zelensky, had spoken several times over the phone and met in Madrid. Now according to The Washington Post, Giuliani said he has had five conversations with Yermak. Separately, Giuliani told the Post he did not address the issue of US aid to Ukraine in the Madrid person to person meeting this summer. ""I was not involved in the aid at all,"" he said,  referring to military aid . ""I had no idea the $250 million was on the table."" He said that Yermak was pushing for an Oval Office meeting between Trump and the Ukrainian president and that the Ukrainians were ""embarrassed"" there had not been one yet.  Giuliani has said he essentially stumbled upon the Biden element. He had been pushing in Ukraine on an effort to clear Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who is currently in jail for tax evasion on money he made for political consulting in Ukraine and elsewhere. Why does Ukraine need US military aid? Ukraine is dealing with Russian-backed separatists in the Eastern part of the country and still opposes Russia's 2014 takeover of Crimea, which had been part of Ukraine. The country is very much standing between Vladimir Putin's Russia and the West. What is the aid used for? The assistance,  according to previous CNN reports , is for sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, counter-artillery radars, night vision and military medical treatment -- all of which Ukrainians could use to counter pro-Russian separatists. What was the official reason that aid to Ukraine was frozen? The White House has said it wanted to make sure the new administration in Ukraine would stay true to its word and cut down on corruption. Vice President Mike Pence, for instance, denied earlier this month that the holdup had anything to do with Biden, but he did say, ""We have great concerns about issues of corruption... I mean, to invest additional taxpayer in Ukraine, the President wants to be assured that those resources are truly making their way to the kind of investments that will contribute to security and stability in Ukraine."" That's very similar to language Trump used Sunday, except Trump tied the idea of corruption in Ukraine to Biden, perhaps further suggesting a link between the money and the investigation. Trump returned to corruption during his comments to reporters at the United Nations on Monday. ""If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?"" he said. ""One of the reasons the new president got elected is he was going to stop corruption. It's very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption. Very important."" How was the aid unfrozen? There was bipartisan opposition to the freeze up on Capitol Hill. CNN reported on September 12 that the administration had suddenly dropped its opposition to the aid after Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, got bipartisan support for an amendment to force the administration's hand. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and Trump ally who nevertheless supported the aid to Ukraine, gave Durbin credit for making the aid happen. ""So why was it released? Because of your amendment, that's why it was released,"" Graham said during an appropriations hearing earlier in September. ""Because I was going to vote for it, so I think they got the message. If you're listening in the Ukraine on C-SPAN, you're going to get the money."" Has Ukraine gotten any of the aid? ""The Department of Defense was able to begin obligating these funds last week. We will continue to leverage all available tools to expedite the implementation of these programs. We expect the majority of the funds to be obligated by the end of the fiscal year,"" according to Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman. Some $60 million had been obligated fairly quickly (as of last Monday), according to a US official. The Pentagon is confident that it can obligate $220 million before the end of the fiscal year and is working with Congress to get an extension to continue the aid delivery. The House voted last week to extend the window for the aid through November. Why is it important when Trump talked to Zelensky?  It's completely incredible that Trump may have pressured the Ukrainian president, essentially asking him to investigate a US political rival, in the very midst of denying his campaign colluded with Russia's election interference in 2016.  On Wednesday, July 24, former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about all of the Trump campaign interactions with Russia in 2016 and explained why his report did not recommend charges against the President or his aides for seeking political help from a foreign government. ""NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION!"" Trump tweeted that day and his allies hailed the end of calls for impeachment. Turns out things were just beginning. He talked to Zelensky the next day. What is the fight over the whistleblower? While there had been plenty of reporting on Biden's involvement in the Ukraine, on Giuliani's quest to highlight it for campaign season and on the temporary halt of aid to Ukraine, the whistleblower complaint is what tied them all together. But the White House tried very hard to keep it quiet. While Congress should be entitled under the law to hear about whistleblower complaints, the White House had justified keeping it from Congress. The Intelligence Community Inspector General informed lawmakers that the complaint existed, but no one outside the intelligence community or the White House has actually seen it. That's because the DNI has, on the advice of the White House and Department of Justice, resisted providing the report to Congress and have said it is not actually covered by the whistleblower law. What are Democrats saying? Even some Democrats who had opposed impeachment proceedings against Trump are now saying there is no alternative. ""I don't think we have a choice under the Constitution,"" said Texas Rep. Vicente Gonzalez on CNN Monday. ""We must move forward with impeachment proceedings.""  ""I don't think we'll have much of a choice,"" he said. ""It seems like the President is really pushing us for impeachment proceedings. I don't know if he's baiting us because he has a personal agenda that he thinks this might be helpful to him."" What is Trump saying now? He was asked exactly during an appearance Monday at the United Nations if he's taking impeachment seriously. ""Not at all seriously,"" Trump said, denying any wrongdoing and staying impeccably on-message that this whole thing has more to do with Biden.  ""We had a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""Everybody knows it's just a Democrat witch hunt. Here we go again. They failed with Russia, they failed with recession and now they're bringing this up. The one who has the problem is Biden. Biden did what they would like to have me do except one problem, I didn't do it.""  This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday."
"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Sen.  Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., surged ahead of former Vice President  Joe Biden  in a new poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers released late Saturday, with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and South Bend, Ind. Mayor  Pete Buttigieg  slipping into a distant third and fourth, respectively. The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll  showed Warren as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. By comparison, the Register poll in June showed Biden leading with 24 percent support, nine percentage points clear of Warren and eight points clear of Sanders. J. Ann Selzer, president of pollster Selzer & Co., told the Register the survey represented ""the first major shakeup” of the Iowa race, because: ""It’s the first time we’ve had someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the leader board."" BIDEN GOES ON THE ATTACK OVER UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, PLEDGES TO BEAT TRUMP 'LIKE A DRUM' Sanders was in third place with 11 percent support, a five percentage-point drop from the Register's June poll. No other candidate cracked 10 percent of the first-choice vote, with Buttigieg garnering nine percent. That also represents a five percentage-point drop from June. Warren also had the highest percentage of poll respondents (20 percent) who said she was their second choice in the February caucus. By contrast, Biden and Sanders each garnered 10 percent of the second-choice vote. Warren also had the highest favorability rating of any candidate, with 75 percent of respondents saying they had a very or mostly favorable view of her compared to 66 percent for Biden and 58 percent for Sanders. BERNIE SANDERS RELEASES PLAN TO ELIMINATE $81B IN PAST-DUE MEDICAL DEBT Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., rounded out the top five, with six percent of voters saying she was their first choice. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Cory Booker, D-NJ, both received three percent. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and hedge fund manager Tom Steyer each received three percent. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The polling shakeup may not be done, as 63 percent of respondents said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. Harris, Buttigieg and Booker could still benefit from late deciders, as 39 percent, 37 percent and 35 percent of poll respondents said they were still actively considering those respective candidates. The poll came from a sample size of 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. It was conducted from Sept. 14-18. The most recent  Fox News poll  of Democratic primary voters nationwide showed Biden with 29 percent support, down six percentage points from his peak in May. Sanders was in second place at 18 percent, up eight percentage points from the previous month's poll, while Warren was on 16 percent, down four points from August."
"The Democratic field got a little bit smaller this week,  shrinking to 19 candidates . Here’s our weekly catch-up on the  2020 election  and some moments you may have missed. ‘Clearly not my time’ Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who entered the Democratic presidential race on the hopes that his brand of urban progressive leadership could appeal on a national scale,  said on Friday that he was ending his candidacy . Breaking: Bill de Blasio announces he is ending his presidential campaign  pic.twitter.com/vL8GcX3xV5 — Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe)  September 20, 2019 
 Mr. de Blasio’s campaign never quite caught on, and his announcement came less than two weeks before the qualification deadline for the  October debate . His inclusion in the event was growing less likely by the day.  “I feel like I’ve contributed all I can to this primary campaign, and it’s clearly not my time,” he said in an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “I’m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City, and I’m going to keep speaking up for working people.” Read more about  Mr. de Blasio’s exit here .  And here’s  our magazine piece  about his journey from progressive hope to punching bag. A big day for Warren  Monday was big for Senator  Elizabeth Warren  of Massachusetts.  She  received the endorsement of the Working Families Party , a labor-aligned progressive group that endorsed Senator  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont  during the last presidential cycle .  She released a 6,000-word  anti-corruption plan , which would make the release of tax returns automatic for candidates for federal office, make it illegal for elected officials to become lobbyists and strengthen ethics requirements for federal judges.  And in a speech at a rally in Manhattan that drew thousands to Washington Square Park, she forcefully attacked corruption and invoked the power of women to bring about sweeping change.  Ms. Warren delivered the speech blocks from the site of the  Triangle shirtwaist factory fire  of 1911, which killed 146 garment workers, most of them immigrant women. It was one of the deadliest industrial disasters in the nation’s history. “The tragic story of the Triangle factory fire is a story about power,” Ms. Warren said. “A story of what happens when the rich and the powerful take control of government and use it to increase their own profits while they stick it to working people. But what happened in the aftermath of the fire is a different story about power — a story about our power, a story about what’s possible when we fight together as one.” Our colleague Alexander Burns noted that in dueling speeches Monday night, Ms. Warren and President Trump  laid out competing visions of populism . Sanders shakes up his operation With five months to go before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Sanders  overhauled his operations in the state , which he won by more than 22 percentage points in 2016.  Mr. Sanders, who hails from neighboring Vermont, almost certainly must win New Hampshire again next year to have a chance at the nomination. The campaign also parted ways with its political director in Iowa,  according to a report  that surfaced later in the week.  Read more  about that move here. ‘A sham process’: Democrats call for Kavanaugh’s impeachment Several candidates called for the impeachment of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh after The New York Times published  new information  about allegations of sexual misconduct against him. Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Senator Kamala Harris of California were among those who called for the justice’s impeachment. “He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice,” Ms. Harris wrote. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called the revelations “profoundly troubling” but stopped short of demanding impeachment. Instead, he called for an investigation into “whether the Trump administration and Senate Republicans pressured the F.B.I. to ignore evidence.” Read  our full report  on the calls for impeachment. Regulating marijuana like alcohol Former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas  released a plan  on Thursday to legalize marijuana, expunge all possession convictions and regulate the substance the way alcohol is regulated. Sales would be limited to adults, smoking would be banned in public areas, and advertising would be restricted.  He also wants to tax the marijuana industry and invest the revenue in the communities of color disproportionately affected by the war on drugs.  Every Democratic candidate supports decriminalizing marijuana, and most, including Mr. O’Rourke, support full legalization. But six candidates — Mr. Biden, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., and former Representative Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania — want to leave the question of legalization up to the states. In other policy news: Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey  unveiled a plan  to bolster workers’ rights. It would protect the right to organize for all workers, including those in the gig economy; end anti-union “right-to-work” laws; and change the way capital gains are taxed. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., released  a disaster preparedness plan  to help communities prepare for and recover from storms. It aims to improve coordination between federal agencies and storm victims, fortify infrastructure and strengthen the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Mr. Buttigieg also detailed his  “Medicare for All Who Want It” plan , which seeks to ensure universal access to coverage by allowing all Americans to opt in to a public-coverage alternative.  Mr. Sanders  introduced a $2.5 trillion housing proposal  that calls for more public and affordable housing,  as well as a national rent control law  that would cap annual rent increases at 3 percent or one and a half times the inflation rate, whichever was higher.  Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund executive, released a  “justice-centered climate plan ,” which he said would create nearly   46 million jobs over 10 years. He also promised to create a civilian climate corps as part of a broad  “national service plan ,” which would aim for a million annual participants by 2025.  And finally ... Overheard on the campaign trail? “I’m moving to Iowa,”  Ms. Harris joked in a comment   to Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii that included an expletive and was overheard by a reporter. The state of California did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Ms. Harris’s remark came as  her campaign announced a new push in the state . In a call with reporters Thursday morning, aides said they hoped to position Ms. Harris for a late-breaking Iowa surge. And they set a firm target: a top-three finish. Ms. Harris’s team sent out a fund-raising email based on her quip. And, of course,  there are already T-shirts . "
"National security attorney Bradley Moss and attorney Harmeet Dhillon weigh in on the whistleblower complaint. A guest on  MSNBC  offered a warning to Democratic lawmakers on Monday night that if they don't pursue impeachment against  President Trump  that they will lose in 2020. Richard Painter, the former White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, began by claiming there was ""no evidence"" that  former Vice President Joe Biden  and his son Hunter Biden, were involved with corruption in Ukraine, as Trump has alleged. But when asked about Trump's ""attempted collusion"" with Ukraine, Painter declared it was an ""impeachable offense."" “This is an impeachable offense, turning the powers of a foreign government against a candidate in the United States who is a political rival of Donald Trump, this in and of itself is impeachable,”  Painter said . “This president has committed multiple high crimes and misdemeanors and what is happening when the House refuses to impeach him, he continues to do more and more of it.” REP. AL GREEN WARNS DEMS: 'THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO TURN ON US' IF WE DON'T IMPEACH TRUMP Painter went on to say that Trump ""feels emboldened"" as House Democrats remain stagnant on impeachment and gave a grim forecast for the Democratic Party if they don't take action. “As Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi doesn’t have the courage to impeach him, he’s going to keep on doing it. He is getting a pass from this Congress,"" Painter continued. ""It’s critically important that the House not only start impeachment investigations formally but that they vote out articles of impeachment, all of the evidence is already there. We don’t need more to impeach this president and if they don’t do it, I think the Democrats are going to lose in 2020, and probably deserve to lose.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The debate among Democrats over Trump's impeachment was revived last week after it was reported that a whistleblower from the intelligence community flagged what was being described as a ""troubling"" interaction the president had with a foreign leader. It was later reported that Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into Biden's son and the president has since been accused of leveraging financial aid to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on the 2020 Democratic frontrunner."

THE SHADOW OF CORRUPTION How corrupt do you think your government is? 
According to Transparency International, which has been ranking countries on its 1-100 scale for 25 years, the United States is not very corrupt at all. 
The  most recent rankings , built through a survey of experts and businesspeople, ranks the U.S. as 22nd cleanest in the 180 nations of the world. We run in a pack with other mostly Western liberal democracies like Australia, Britain and France just behind the squeaky clean Scandinavian nations and, of course, Canada. 
We are far removed from the rampant corruption under which most of the rest of the world is forced to live. Russia, China, India and Brazil are all bad news when it comes to basic principles of fairness. All of Africa except for Botswana and every Asian nation except Japan are considered substantially corrupt.   
So your government, on an empirical basis, is pretty much on the level. 
But that’s not the important question. What matters is how corrupt do you  think  your government is. And on that score, the news is bad. 
In our most recent Fox News  poll , we asked respondents “How many people in the government do you think are corrupt -- almost all, many, some, or almost none?” The results should be sobering for everyone concerned about the current trajectory of politics. 
About one in five said that almost all of the people in government are corrupt. An amazing 43 percent said that “many” are crooked. Just 31 percent got closer to reality saying that “some” in the government are corrupt. A sad 2 percent said “almost none.” 
As with all reputational goods, like a nation’s currency, the perception of value is far more important than the actual value itself. If a government is perceived as corrupt it’s almost as bad as the real thing, and will eventually result in real corruption anyway. 
If you think the game is rigged, you’re far more likely to be willing to cheat yourself. 
The 64 percent of Americans who believe their government is rotten with corruption don’t belong to any particular demographic or political group, either. Women are a little more distrustful than men and white people are more dubious than other ethnic groups, whites without college degrees most of all. 
But religious faith, political proclivities, education and income all had relatively little bearing on the overall perception that corruption is a major problem in our government. 
It’s no wonder, given what both political parties are selling these days. It would be one thing if the response was really about “draining the swamp” and some sustained effort for reforms that might bring public perception back into alignment with reality. But what tends to happen is that politicians exploit such perceptions to create lower expectations for good government and accountability once they are in power. 
If the whole system is rigged, why should our side have to play by the rules? After all  they’re  the real crooks  
That’s how the false perception of rampant corruption makes way for the real thing. THE RULEBOOK: THERE’S A DIFFERENCE 
“It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.” –  James Madison ,  Federalist No. 14 TIME OUT: SOUNDS LIKE AMERICA Gun&Garden:  “When  Ken Burns  decides to cover a topic, set aside some time to dig in. Best known for his epics, including his  Civil War  documentary, which aired on PBS over five nights in 1990 to an audience of 40 million people, the filmmaker is now readying for the premiere his latest deep-dive,  Country Music . The eight-part, sixteen-hour film takes a magnifying glass to the forces that shaped this distinctly American sound. ‘I’m looking for stories, and I’m looking for stories that are firing on all cylinders,’ Burns tells  Garden & Gun . … The film runs chronologically, tracing the many influences that shaped country music, from enslaved people bringing the banjo across the Atlantic from Africa all the way to the heyday of pop-country in the mid-1990s. The genre, Burns reveals, is less a set of rules and boundaries than it is a spectrum—one that trades on universal truths and bridges cultural, racial, and economic divides.” Flag on the play? -  Email us at  HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM  with your tips, comments or questions.

BIDEN RACKS UP KEY ENDORSEMENTS AP:  “ Joe Biden  sought to demonstrate a broad appeal to Democrats on Thursday with new endorsements from leading African American lawmakers and a former governor of a pivotal swing state. The backing from Reps.  G.K. Butterfield  of North Carolina,  Emanuel Cleaver  of Missouri and  Charlie Crist  of Florida reflects Biden’s play both for the party establishment and for minority voters who are critical in the early stages of the primary. Butterfield and Cleaver are former chairmen of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Crist was the governor of Florida before he entered Congress. The moves are the latest example of Biden’s durability as an early Democratic front-runner. So far, he’s successfully threaded different wings of the party despite skepticism from progressives and questions about whether, at 76, he’s too old for the presidency. … [T]he support of Butterfield and Cleaver in particular is a potential blow to Sen.  Kamala Harris  [and] Sen.  Cory Booker …” Younger black voters try to pry their parents from Biden -  NYT:  “If Mr. Biden, 76, is going to win the Democratic nomination, it is likely to be because of the support of older black voters… But if he is to be overtaken by one of his more progressive rivals, the most powerful tool against him may not be opposition research or negative advertisements. Instead, it may be an organic effort by younger black voters — concerned about Mr. Biden’s age and more moderate ideology — to sway their older family members. Mr. Biden seems aware of this dynamic. In interviews, he has both acknowledged the generational gap among his black supporters and downplayed its importance, arguing that the support of older, more moderate black voters would be enough to give him an electoral advantage. Still, Mr. Biden, by his own admission, would be unwise to underestimate the lobbying efforts of those who are young and politically engaged.” Harris takes aim at Warren -  WSJ:  “Ka­mala Har­ris, now a dis­tant fourth in the De­mo­c­ra­tic pres­i­den­tial race, took aim at poll-climber  Eliz­a­beth War­ren  for do­ing big-money events. In re­sponse to a ques­tion about War­ren, Har­ris said at a closed-door fundraiser it was hyp­o­crit­i­cal for her ri­val to claim she wasn’t tak­ing money from large donors when War­ren trans­ferred around $10 mil­lion from her Sen­ate funds be­fore de­nounc­ing big money do­na­tions. Har­ris moved $1.2 mil­lion into her pres­i­den­tial fund. Har­ris lamented that she now needs to be in places like New York to keep the cam­paign fi­nan­cially afloat but prefers to spend time in early vot­ing states. On a later press call, Har­ris’s cam­paign didn’t name War­ren di­rectly but noted re­peat­edly that Har­ris came into the cam­paign with less than other can­di­dates be­cause ‘we spent 2018 rais­ing for other can­di­dates.’” And same with Buttigieg -   AP:  “Democratic presidential candidate  Pete Buttigieg  is accusing his 2020 rival Elizabeth Warren of being ‘extremely evasive’ when it comes to explaining how she'd finance a universal health care plan. Speaking on CNN on Thursday, Buttigieg issued his most pointed attack yet on the Massachusetts senator, saying she ‘was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we've seen that repeatedly.’ The sharpened critique comes as the fall campaign kicks into high gear with Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses scheduled in February. Warren has assembled a well-organized campaign there and leads Buttigieg in Iowa, where the South Bend, Indiana, mayor's longshot presidential campaign is competing heavily and trying to break through.” Yang plays Perot for a new generation -   Atlantic:  “To understand why [ Andrew Yang  is hanging on in the polls], it’s worth looking at how he responded earlier this month when  Shane Gillis , a comedian for Saturday Night Live, referred to him using a racial slur. Yang urged that Gillis not be fired. … But more revealing was Yang’s explanation for why Gillis deserved forgiveness. Gillis, Yang tweeted, ‘does not strike me as malignant or evil. He strikes me as a still-forming comedian from central Pennsylvania.’ What does central Pennsylvania have to do with it? For Andrew Yang and his supporters, everything. It’s code for economic distress—which Yang believes fuels racism and most of the other problems that menace America. … Over the past quarter century, two presidential candidates have mobilized these economics-first, culture-war-indifferent voters into a potent force. The first was  Ross Perot . The second is Andrew Yang.” De Blasiout -   Fox News:  “New York Mayor  Bill de Blasio  announced Friday he is dropping out of the 2020 Democratic primary, ending his campaign after struggling to gain traction in the race. ‘I feel like I contributed all I can to this primary election and it’s clearly not my time,’ he said during an appearance on MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe.’ ‘So I’m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City and I’m going to keep speaking up for working people.’ De Blasio entered the presidential race in May, running as a proud progressive. But his campaign never caught fire: He qualified for the first two rounds of Democratic presidential debates but has failed to make the cut for the others.” Booker hides from past alliance with DeVos -   WaPo:  “Cory Booker was a little-known member of the Newark City Council 19 years ago when he received an extraordinary invitation from a Michigan group connected to  Betsy DeVos , now the U.S. Secretary of Education. DeVos and her husband,  Dick , were leading Republican proponents of a state ballot initiative that would allow taxpayer-financed vouchers to pay for private schools. … Booker accepted. … But as Booker runs for president, his relationship with DeVos, his previous support of vouchers and his continuing praise for charter schools present potential roadblocks. Vouchers and charters schools are anathema to many powerful teachers unions, who have outsize power in Democratic primaries, and some candidates in the party strongly oppose them on the grounds that they weaken traditional public schools.” UKRAINE AT CENTER OF FIGHT OVER ALLEGED TRUMP PROMISE Fox News:  “The developing controversy over a mysterious phone conversation  President Trump  had with a foreign leader apparently centers on Ukraine, as the president and his allies fight back and claim the uproar is just another ‘partisan’ plot against him. What touched off the controversy is a secret whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ‘promise’ Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. Trump's attorney,  Rudy Giuliani , seemed to acknowledge some effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate potential corruption related to the Biden family, though he gave conflicting answers on the matter in a CNN interview overnight. It remains unclear what the supposed ‘promise’ from Trump entailed. The president, however, maintained he said nothing improper, tearing into those pushing the allegations Friday.” Giuliani inconsistent -  WaPo:  “Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, contradicted himself when asked whether he personally asked Ukraine to investigate former vice president  Joe Biden , ranted about media bias and defended Trump amid new reports about an intelligence official’s whistleblower complaint, during a chaotic and fiery CNN interview Thursday night. Immediately after anchor  Chris Cuomo  introduced him and summarized the latest news out of the whistleblower story, which had only broken about an hour prior, Giuliani went into attack mode. … Giuliani spent the first half of the interview repeating the claim that Biden in 2016 pressured Ukraine to drop its top prosecutor, which at the time was also investigating a natural gas company where Biden’s son  Hunter  was on the board. …There’s been no evidence found that Biden was trying to help out his son.” TRUMP RALLIES WITH MODI IN OUTREACH TO KEY VOTER BLOC WaPo:  “President Trump heads to Harris County, Texas this weekend to a major rally ahead of next week's United Nations General Assembly — for Indian Prime Minister  Narendra Modi . The website for the ‘Howdy, Modi’ rally boasts that the ‘live audience will be the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader visiting the United States other than the Pope’: Some 50,000 people, many from Houston's large Indian diaspora, are expected to turn out. It's eye-popping that leaders of the world's two biggest democracies are appearing together at such an event — let alone that this particular American president will be holding court in the epicenter of Texas's blue wave and the most diverse city in America. You're not wrong if you think that doesn't sound like friendly territory for Trump. But that's a strong political reason for him to go: Democrats are making a big play for Texas in 2020 and Republicans are growing concerned. The rally for Modi, who is hugely popular in India, provides Trump with access to a potential pool of Indian American voters that could turn out to be critical in next year's presidential elections.” SENATE DEMS NEED BIG WINS IN THE SUN BELT Politico:  “To take back the White House, Democrats only need to win back three key Rust Belt states. But if they want to move a president’s agenda through the Senate, they have to flip the Sun Belt. From Arizona to North Carolina to a pair of seats in Georgia, Democrats have to clean up in that stretch of the country to have any chance of taking the chamber. President Donald Trump carried each of those states in 2016, and in an era of polarized politics when Senate races are increasingly nationalized, Democrats need at least strong performances by the party's presidential nominee in the Sun Belt states — if not victories — to have a shot at flipping their Senate seats. So while some Democrats are laser-focused on winning back the Rust Belt, Democrats across the Southern half of the country are urging their party to invest heavily in their states — not just as a way to flip the Senate, but as part of the path to 270 Electoral College votes.” Kemp frustrates GOP with cattle call for Senate appointment -   AJC:  “Within hours of Gov.  Brian Kemp ’s unusual decision to invite the public to apply to succeed U.S. Sen.  Johnny Isakson , his office was blitzed with resumes — some serious and some silly — from wannabe Washingtonians.Lawyers. Doctors. Local government officials. Serial jokesters. IT specialists. A well-known pundit. As of Wednesday evening, 158 people had applied — and many, many more are expected to join in. … Welcome to the next phase of the race for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Chances are, Kemp and his advisers already have whittled a list of top contenders for Isakson’s seat down to a handful — and that the online application process unveiled late Tuesday will be largely for show. But encouraging would-be U.S. senators to publicly declare their ambition might just expand the scope of his search even as it forces some tough decisions on potential contenders.” PLAY-BY-PLAY Fox Poll: Voters are frustrated with government, nervous about economy   -  Fox News Trump files lawsuit in bid to protect personal, corporate tax returns from release  -  Fox News McConnell flips stance, announces support for $250 million in election security funding  -  WaPo Sanders becomes first Dem candidate to hit one million donors  -  Politico AUDIBLE: IOWA NICE?

"Sean Hannity  did not hold back when addressing Democrats announcing the  formalization of an impeachment inquiry  into  President Trump  Tuesday, saying they were motivated by ""Trump rage."". ""The psychotic anti-Trump hysteria has now completely overtaken the entire Democratic Party,"" Hannity said Tuesday. ""What is happening is dangerous to this country. It is grossly political, will forever alter how any president in the future ... will be able to communicate freely with other world leaders,"" Hannity said. ""The world is less safe and secure tonight as a result of yet the latest partisan witch hunt."" TRUMP VOWS TO RELEASE TRANSCRIPT OF CALL WITH UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT During her announcement Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , in which the president is accused of pressing the foreign leader to ratchet up an inquiry into presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of the law. The law is unequivocal."" Hannity said that Democrats have done Trump a ""huge favor"" by pursuing impeachment.

"Reaction and analysis from American Center for Law and Justice executive director Jordan Sekulow. Editor’s note: Peter Schweizer and the Government Accountability Institute spent three years investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter and their dealings in the Ukraine and China. The research culminated in the #1 New York Times  bestselling book  “Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends” (Harper Collins, March 2018). Below are some of the results of the investigation.  1.  Joe Biden’s  son, Hunter Biden, joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma in April 2014, according to RSB bank records. Hunter Biden had little background in energy. Over a 16-month period, Burisma paid $3.1 million to a bank account associated with Hunter’s business. 2.  Joe Biden led  the Obama administration’s policy toward Ukraine when he served as vice president. Biden helped shape Ukraine’s energy and anti-corruption policies, issues that directly  impact Burisma . 3. Burisma sought to capitalize Hunter Biden’s name and relationships.  According to The New York Times , Hunter Biden helped assemble the company’s legal team, which consisted of American attorneys and consulting firms, including a former Obama Justice Department official. PETER SCHWEIZER: TRUMP RIGHT TO QUESTION BIDEN DEALINGS WITH UKRAINE, DESPITE DEM CRITICISM 4. Burisma is led by an oligarch named Mykola Zlochevsky. Zlochevsky served as ecology minister under pro-Russia former Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovich,  leading to allegations  that he used his office to benefit Burisma.

"WASHINGTON — The Democratic National Committee said on Monday that it would demand a slight increase in the polling and fund-raising thresholds that presidential candidates must meet in order to qualify for the party’s November  primary debate , a move that may once again shrink the field of participating candidates.  To be invited to the November debate, candidates must have received donations from at least 165,000 individual donors and must meet one of two polling requirements. They must either receive 3 percent support in four national or early-state polls conducted by qualifying pollsters, or 5 percent support in two polls in the four early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.  Polls will count if they were publicly released between Sept. 13 and midnight seven days before the debate. The date and location of the November debate have yet to be announced.

 At least 11 candidates have already met the 165,000-donor threshold, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Only three qualifying polls have been released since Sept. 13., and two of them were national polls, meaning no candidates have fully qualified for the November debate yet. Candidates must also prove they have at least 600 unique donors in at least 20 states, United States territories or the District of Columbia, the D.N.C. said. As the Democratic primary has progressed, party officials have gradually tightened the standards for debate qualification, making it harder and harder to clear the bar.  The 20 candidates who participated in the two-night debates held in June and July only had to amass donations from 65,000 people or reach 1 percent support in three qualifying polls. The qualification standards for this month’s debate were much stricter: Candidates were required to collect donations from 130,000 unique donors and achieve 2 percent support in four qualifying polls.  Only 10 candidates cleared the higher bar and  the debate was held over just one night . With the addition of Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund investor, 11 candidates have already qualified for the October debate, which has the same requirements. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii needs just one more qualifying poll result to make the cut. The repeated tightening of the standards has caused considerable consternation among the candidates,  causing many to gripe about the rules  and nudging some to drop out of the race altogether. Aides to several of the second-tier candidates feared that Tom Perez, the D.N.C. chairman, would raise the bar much higher, effectively limiting the debate field to just a handful of candidates. The modest threshold increase for the November debate came as a relief to on-the-bubble campaigns that had been preparing for a requirement of up to 260,000 individual donors, which would have forced unpleasant decisions about whether to divert resources from grass-roots organizing to online advertising in search of new donors. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York ,  Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington  and  John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor , exited the race in August after it became clear that they would not qualify for the fall debates. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York  dropped out  last week after failing to qualify for the September debate and realizing he stood almost no chance of getting onstage next month. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who both participated in the September debate and have qualified for the October one, have in recent weeks emailed appeals to supporters warning they could be left off the stage in November and December without an uptick in their fund-raising.  Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey  sent a message to supporters over the weekend , saying that without an infusion of $1.7 million by the end of the month his campaign may no longer be viable. On Monday, he sent another email acknowledging the newly released debate thresholds, noting that he had not reached 165,000 individual donors and asking supporters to chip in. According to the Times analysis, he is the only candidate who has participated in all of the debates and has not yet reached 165,000 donors. Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, who did not qualify for the September debate and is not likely to make the stage for October’s, has been one of the most vocal critics of the process.  He renewed his attacks this month after it became clear that Mr. Steyer would qualify for the October debate after using millions of dollars of his own money to buy advertisements that have helped him draw in donations and increase his standing in the polls.  “At this point, there isn’t much left to be said regarding a set of rules that have allowed a billionaire to bankroll his way onto the debate stage, while governors and senators with decades of public service experience have been forced out of the race,” said Mr. Bullock, who has failed to earn 2 percent in a single qualifying poll. “This process is failing Democrats and does nothing to help us beat Donald Trump next November.” The D.N.C.’s announcement may begin a new cycle of protests and recriminations from candidates who do not qualify. But  while riding on a campaign bus in Iowa  on Sunday, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who seems likely to make the November debate stage, was circumspect. “I think it’s mission impossible for the D.N.C. to please everybody,” he said. Maggie Astor contributed reporting."
"There was a lot of drama. Senator Cory Booker, by way of greeting, lifted one of the moderators of Friday night’s  L.G.B.T.Q. Presidential Forum  right off the floor in a great bear hug. Later, an audience member interrupted Senator Amy Klobuchar with what sounded like an appeal to “protect sex workers.” And then there was Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who was asked what it would feel like to serve as president of a country for which he could not, under current regulations, donate his blood. But the most breathtaking moment, by my reckoning, belonged to Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said that she wasn’t just going to tell us what she’d do in her first 100 days. She would show us. And then she read aloud the names of the  18 transgender women of color  who have been murdered this year, in a voice that quavered with emotion. “It is time,” she concluded, “for a president of the United States of America to say their names.” Those names are Dana Martin, Jazzaline Ware, Ashanti Carmon, Claire Legato,  Muhlaysia Booker , Michelle Tamika Washington, Paris Cameron,  Chynal Lindsey , Chanel Scurlock, Zoe Spears, Brooklyn Lindsey, Denali Berries Stuckey, Kiki Fantroy, Pebbles LaDime “Dime” Doe, Tracy Single, Bailey Reeves, Bee Love Slater, and  Ja’leyah-Jamar . It was a historic night — the first time candidates for president have been brought together to discuss queer issues, in an event sponsored by  The Gazette , the  Advocate ,  One Iowa , and  GLAAD  (the L.G.B.T.Q. nonprofit which I served as national co-chair for four years). Cory Booker was the star of the first hour. After he bear-hugged  Zach Stafford , the editor of the Advocate, he gave a speech that was, for all its brevity, a barn burner. “You cannot lead the people,” he said, “if you do not love the people.” Meanwhile, as an older American — and one from Pennsylvania at that — I have a longtime affection for former Vice President Joe Biden, a fondness that has occasionally put me at odds with a younger generation of queer activists. I had hoped that Biden’s appearance at the forum would finally put to rest the uncertainty around his candidacy. That didn’t happen. Instead, — I’m so sorry to have to say this — he appeared, once again, to be  phoning it in . He said a few passionate but circuitous words as he stepped onto the stage, then looked over at the host, Lyz Lenz, an Iowa-based writer. “Do I go sit down?” he asked. She nodded. “Honestly, I thought you’d go a little longer.” Later, when she asked about Biden’s description of Mike Pence as “a decent guy,” he just looked at her and said, “You’re a lovely person.” Backstage, Lenz said, Biden had called her “sweetheart.” It may well be that this was, once again, just Joe being Joe. But — to put it mildly — he’s wearing me down. He has to do better. Pete Buttigieg had a good night; so did Julián Castro. Senator Kamala Harris did well enough, but I had hoped she’d show some of the grace and magic on display in the first debate. That didn’t happen, either. There were three losers of the forum, all Republicans: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, and the president himself. Many of the candidates took special note to lament the actions of the trio: DeVos, for  refusing to investigate complaints  by trans students in schools; Carson for his  horrific description  of trans women this week as “big hairy men;” and Donald Trump for pretty much everything: for the damage his administration has done to queer America, and for his passion, as abetted by Russian trolls, for pitting us against one another. Another loser last night was Senator Bernie Sanders, who did not show. There’s  a second forum  coming up in October, sponsored by U.C.L.A. and the Human Rights Campaign. Sanders isn’t going to that one, either. His campaign cites scheduling conflicts. Some of the other winners weren’t candidates. Angelica Ross, the chief moderator, was poised and fierce; you could make the case that she was more electrifying than any of people actually in the race. The sponsors of the event had a lot to celebrate as well, just for the fact of pulling this whole thing off. GLAAD’s chief executive,  Sarah Kate Ellis , provided a poised, articulate keynote as the evening began. As I listened to her, it occurred to me — and not for the first time — that I wouldn’t mind it one bit if she ran for president herself. Which is more than I can say about some people. But it was Warren and Booker who shone brightest. Warren, when asked about some Americans objecting to the morality of queer lives, responded with the parable in Matthew 25 about the sheep and the goats. “Whatever you have done for the least of my brothers and sisters,” she read, quoting Christ, “you did for me.” I would hope that this passage from Scripture gives Mike Pence something to think about. Booker, in making an appeal for a revival of civic grace, was nothing short of inspirational. Is this the moment he breaks out of the middle of the pack, and rises into the top tier? We’ll know soon enough. “What does love look like in public?” he asked. “It looks like justice.” The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters  to the editor.

"Trump tweets that the American people will see it was a 'very friendly and totally appropriate call' with 'no quid pro quo!' MSNBC host Chris Hayes isn’t sure  Americans can trust the transcript  of  President Trump’s  controversial call with Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky , so he turned to Twitter to smear it in advance. Trump announced on Tuesday that he would release the full transcript of the call, in which they reportedly discussed an investigation involving 2020 Democratic hopeful Joe Biden's kin. But the liberal pundit pre-emptively raised doubts about the transcript's veracity, because of how the president “pressures and manipulates” his staff. “Given what we know about how Trump pressures and manipulates civil servants to toe his line, I'm not *quite* sure we can trust the transcript itself as being accurate/comprehensive,” Hayes tweeted on Tuesday. NBC, COMCAST SILENT ON LAWRENCE O’DONNELL’S RETRACTED REPORT THAT BYPASSED MSNBC’S VERIFICATION PROCESS NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News he isn’t surprised that an anti-Trump cable news host would attempt to discredit the transcript in advance -- just in case it turns out to help the president fend off a whistleblower's allegations. “One of the most time-honored traditions in the liberal media is the moving of the goalposts when their adversaries and/or enemies do the very thing they've been asking for. Now that the president is going to be releasing the ‘complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of his phone call, the stampede of excuses were petty and sad but, again, predictable,” Houck told Fox News. “One of the most time-honored traditions in the liberal media is the moving of the goalposts when their adversaries and/or enemies do the very thing they've been asking for.""

"Michael Knowles says the Biden campaign does not benefit from news surrounding his son’s overseas business with the Ukraine. Utah Sen.  Mitt Romney , who has recently said he may decline to support  President Trump ’s reelection bid, tweeted on Sunday that it would be ‘troubling in the extreme’ if the president appealed to his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Romney, in a tweet on Sunday, said it was ""critical for the facts to come out.” Trump called his conversations with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy “perfectly fine and routine."" “Nothing was said that was in any way wrong,”  Trump said. Trump has been reportedly accused of pressuring Zelenskiy to work with his  personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, in investigating Hunter Biden, and using military aid as leverage.  Trump denied making any improper requests, but he did point fingers at the Bidens and their relationship with Ukraine. The Democratic presidential hopeful’s son Hunter Biden had been investigated related to business interests.  Biden has said in the past that the  U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden’s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. Biden told reporters in Iowa on Saturday that “Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader trying to intimidate a foreign leader, if that’s what happened.” GET THE FOX NEWS APP He accused Trump of “doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.” Trump accused Biden of dishonesty in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling the  New Yorker  that they spoke “just once” about it.

"The age of transparency must be balanced against an enduring presidential interest, says Fox News contributor Ken Starr, former independent counsel. Fox News contributor Ken Starr said Tuesday that the White House should not ""rush"" to release a transcript of President Trump's phone call with the president of  Ukraine  that triggered a whistleblower complaint and calls for impeachment from some  House Democrats . Trump was accused of pressuring President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate  Joe Biden  in connection with his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine. The furor began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week that involved allegations that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Zelensky. The Trump administration  pushed back Tuesday  against accusations that Trump pressured Zelensky over Hunter Biden while also holding back nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. Starr, a former independent counsel and U.S. solicitor general, responded on  ""America's Newsroom""  to Democrats who are demanding that the White House release the transcript of the call. SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL ""Not at this time. I don't think there should be a rush. There are dangers, the precedent of any president making public transcripts of confidential conversations,"" he said. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE' Starr said all calls between a U.S. president and a foreign leader are ""sensitive,"" suggesting a negotiated solution between the White House and the Senate Intelligence Committee in the interest of ""accountability and checks and balances."" ""There are different ways of calibrating and negotiating this, but don't rush to publish,"" Starr cautioned the White House. GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""We live, I know, in the age of transparency. But that has to be balanced against an enduring presidential interest in carrying on the foreign policy of the United States in a responsible way."" Biden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump and  his allies  have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate's role."
"Democrats, activists offer doomsday climate scenarios. We hope you had a happy weekend. If you did, hold on to those memories. It might be the last relaxing moment you'll have for a while. We're about to wreck your peace of mind. It turns out that all is not well on this blue planet of ours, far from it. Indeed, it appears that the  Earth  itself is facing what we're going to call tonight, an existential threat from  climate change . Now, what does the term ""existential threat"" actually mean, you ask? Honestly, we don't know. But it sounds absolutely terrifying. CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTS SNARL DC TRAFFIC AS BIZARRE SCENES UNFOLD IN CAPITAL Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., presidential candidate: The climate change is real. It is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet. Sen. Cory Booker , D-N.J., presidential candidate: If NATO is about the common defense, the biggest existential threat is climate change. Former Vice President Joe Biden , presidential candidate: This is climate change. It really is the existential threat. Julian Castro , presidential candidate: We're going to have to address the most existential threat to our nation and the world, climate change. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Beto O'Rourke , presidential candidate: On climate change, the greatest existential threat that we face. Sen. Kamala Harris , D-Calif., presidential candidate: We are facing a climate crisis, it represents an existential threat to who we are as human beings. ""A threat to who we are as humans."" Well, there are a number of questions here. Let's see if we can unpack them. The first one: is climate change real? That's an easy one. Of course, it's real. Climate always changes. If you're in the United States, for example, the ground that you're standing on right now was not so long ago really covered with glacial ice a mile thick. Now, it's not covered in glacial ice a mile thick. So what happened? What happened is climate change. That's been happening since the Earth cooled. Is human activity accelerating climate change? Can we reverse or slow climate change? Despite what they tell you, no one really knows. But the real question here has nothing to do with climate science. It has to do with people who pretend they understand climate science. Do those people actually believe what they're saying? This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets. Well, let's see. Here was Kamala Harris recently  talking at a CNN town hall  about how red meat contributes to the absolutely existential threat of climate change. Harris: As a nation, we have actually have to have a real priority at the highest level of government around what we eat and in terms of healthy eating, because we have a problem in America. Erin Burnett, CNN host: But would you support changing the Dietary Guidelines? Harris: Yes. Burnett: You know, the food pyramid, what people are eating? Harris: Yes. Burnett: So reduce red meat specifically. Harris: Yes, I would. Got that? Kamala Harris is a good person, and because she is a good person -- a much better person than you are -- she cares about the existential threat of climate change so much, that she is willing to forgo red meat. That's what she told CNN viewers recently. But when she is in the pork producing state of Iowa, though, it's a very different story. Just this past weekend, Harris attended the Annual Polk County Democratic Party Steak Fry. She took her turn working the grill posing for the cameras. And by the way, so did  all of the other Democratic candidates .  Liz Warren  was there, Beto O'Rourke, even Cory Booker, who says he is a vegan. Organizers grilled more than 10,000 steaks over the weekend. Tape of the event shows plumes of ozone destroying meat smoke rising heavenward. The candidates standing amidst all of this seemed wholly unconcerned. Are you surprised? Don't be surprised. This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets. No one says a word about it. Last week, millions of concerned progressives took part in the so-called climate strike. In their wake, they left mountains of litter. On Monday in Washington, climate activists demanded change by blocking roads, causing gridlock, and throwing confetti on the ground. Well, if you're under 40, you might be surprised to learn that people didn't use to express concern about the environment by littering. That used to seem weird, but then the point of environmentalism used to be about nature and preserving it and protecting it. The point now is very different. The point now is political power. You gin up a crisis and you demand the population submit to your will, or else. And as you do that, of course, you don't need to fight fair or acknowledge democracy or make a rational case for your position. You do whatever it takes. You'll even use children, if it helps. Just today, for example, a 16-year-old Swedish girl named Greta Thunberg addressed the United Nations at the behest of climate activists. Here's part of what she said: Thunberg, climate change activist: This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school, on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams, my childhood with your empty words. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is the money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you? If you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil, and that I refuse to believe. You stole my childhood? Do what I want you to do, or else you're evil? How do you respond to statements like that? The truth is you can't respond. And of course, that's the point. When you use children to demand power, they become a kind of human shield. You can hide safely behind them, no one can criticize you. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But who would do something that unscrupulous?

"The White House is set to release document showing intel community watchdog found whistleblower had 'political bias'; John Roberts reports. The intelligence community inspector general found that the whistleblower who leveled explosive allegations against President Trump concerning his  phone call  with  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  showed indications of “political bias” and was “in favor of a rival political candidate,” a new document shows. The Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel on Wednesday morning released an opinion on the whistleblower’s complaint, which had claimed to report a matter of “urgent concern.” The OLC determined that the complaint, though, “does not involve an ‘urgent concern’” and does not require that the director of national intelligence “transmit the complaint to the intelligence committees.” UKRAINE CALL MEMO SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, BUT DID NOT MENTION AID This determination is at the heart of a disagreement that has pitted the DOJ and intelligence director against the inspector general and congressional Democrats. The latter maintain that the complaint should be turned over to Congress. Such a step is being considered, though the White House released a rough transcript Wednesday morning showing Trump indeed pressed Ukraine to look into Biden family dealings, as had been alleged. But Trump, in the transcript, did not explicitly tie the request to military aid. Included in the OLC opinion, though, was a section that revealed the whistleblower showed indications of a “political bias” -- as  Fox News first reported  Tuesday -- while saying that the inspector general still believed the allegations were credible. “Although the ICIG’s preliminary review found ‘some indica of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,’ the ICIG concluded that the complaint’s allegations nonetheless appeared credible,” the opinion said. The name of the rival candidate was not revealed in the opinion. Fox News previously reported that the whistleblower also did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, according to sources. The OLC opinion came in conjunction with the released transcript of the president’s call with Zelensky. The whistleblower complaint alleged that unnamed “White House officials” had “expressed concern about the content of a telephone call between the President and a foreign leader.” READ UKRAINE CALL MEMO According to the ICIG, “statements made by the president during the call could be viewed as soliciting a foreign campaign contribution in violation of campaign-finance laws.” The DOJ has not reached such a determination. The transcript, declassified by Trump, indicates the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25 from 9:03 a.m. to 9:33 a.m. It begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually broaches the subject former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.” That refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention. Trump, in the run-up to the transcript's release, was accused by Democrats of essentially pressuring a foreign power to investigate a political opponent, as Biden is now a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. On Monday, it was reported that Trump had even ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before the phone call with Zelensky, a detail that fueled impeachment calls leading to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday. But the call transcript does not show Trump mentioning the aid as a bargaining chip or otherwise. The transcript shows Zelensky suggesting to Trump the Biden matter would be looked into by a new prosecutor. “He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue,"" he said. ""The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and we will work on the investigation of the case.” The release of the transcript and of the opinion from the OLC come after Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump, answering mounting calls from her caucus to make the process official. Democrats are seeking the whistleblower’s complaint in a full and unredacted format. The DNI general counsel said, though, after consulting with the DOJ, the matter did not meet the legal definition of “urgent concern,"" and was not subject to mandatory disclosure to Congress. Fox News’ Jake Gibson, Catherine Herridge, John Roberts and Alex Pappas contributed to this report."
"Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs, Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee, joins Shepard Smith on 'Shepard Smith Reporting.' Top Republicans on Thursday pushed to identify the White House officials who told a whistleblower of alleged misconduct by the Trump administration, as Democrats ramped up their impeachment inquiry -- and several apparent inconsistencies emerged in the whistleblower's complaint. Republicans specifically questioned why the whistleblower's sources in the White House didn't file a complaint themselves -- especially given that relevant whistleblower  procedures   did not protect second-hand complaints until shortly before the whistleblower filed the complaint  against Trump. (The New York Times  reported  that the whistleblower is a CIA officer detailed to the White House. Fox News has not confirmed The Times' report.) Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., a member of the House Judiciary Committee,  told Fox News' ""Shepard Smith Reporting""  on Thursday that the administration had an apparent ""leak problem,"" adding, ""if they're leaking something that's supposed to be classified, then ... that probably is criminal in nature."" ""Let's find out,"" Biggs said when Smith asked if he wanted to see the whistleblower's sources. The  whistleblower's complaint , released earlier in the day, contained no firsthand accounts of wrongdoing. It cited information from White House officials who alleged there'd been efforts to hide Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, among other conversations. The Trump administration  reportedly  began placing transcripts of Trump's calls with several foreign leaders in a highly classified repository after leakers publicly divulged the contents of Trump's private calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia in 2017. FLASHBACK: LEAK OF TRUMP CALL WITH AUSTRALIA LEADER  PROMPTS WH TO INCREASE SECURITY MEASURES The complaint stated that Trump made a “specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike"" -- a request that does not appear in the  declassified transcript of the call released by the Trump administration  on Tuesday. Trump mentioned CrowdStrike, but did not demand the server. And according to the whistleblower complaint, by mid-May, U.S. diplomat Kurt Volker sought to ""contain the damage"" from Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's outreach to Ukraine. But a July 19 text message conversation from Volker to Giuliani, provided to Fox News on Thursday, showed that Volker had in fact encouraged Giuliani to reach out to Ukraine -- even sending Giuliani a message reading, ""connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky."" 
      A screenshot of a text message conversation in July between U.S. diplomat Kurt Volker and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani.
       Additionally, the complaint said Trump ""suggested that Mr. Zelensky might want to keep"" his current prosecutor general, a claim not supported by the transcript. CBS News  reported  late Thursday that the whistleblower complaint further inaccurately claimed that a State Department official was on the call with Zelensky. TRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ACCUSES BIDENS OF CORRUPTION, DEMS OF HYPOCRISY The memo was not a ""verbatim transcript"" but was based on ""notes and recollections"" of those memorializing the call. As questions arose concerning the whistleblower's identity and credibility,  Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C., echoed Biggs' skepticism and called for more information. ""It is imperative we find out which White House official talked to the whistleblower and why. Why didn’t they lodge the complaint?"" he asked on Twitter. ""When I think of whistleblower complaints I generally think of someone with first-hand knowledge of the events in question,"" Graham added. Trump, for his part, reportedly threw his support behind an inquiry into the whistleblower's sources. ""I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that’s close to a spy,"" Trump said, according to audio of his remarks at a private event in a New York hotel obtained by The Los Angeles Times. ""You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now."" TRUMP ADMIN DECLASSIFIES, RELEASES WHISTLEBLOWER TRANSCRIPT Among the whistleblower's most explosive accusations was that ""White House officials who heard"" Trump's July call with Zelensky were ""deeply disturbed"" by it, and that White House lawyers discussed how to handle the call ""because of the likelihood, in the officials' retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain."" The complaint cited ""multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call."" TRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALLEGES BIDEN CORRUPTION, SAYS DEMS THREATENED UKRAINE AID MULTIPLE TIMES The complaint went on to raise the specter of a cover-up. It said, ""In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced -- as is customary -- by the White House Situation Room."" Trump administration officials allegedly said White House attorneys ""directed"" them to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they normally were kept, according to the complaint. Instead, the transcript allegedly was kept on a  system normally used for classified information. The whistleblower said that, according to White House officials, it was ""not the first time"" a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national security-sensitive information. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, in tense testimony Thursday on Capitol Hill, defended his handling of the whistleblower  complaint , while calling the matter ""unprecedented."" But after maintaining his composure for most of the morning, his frustration showed through at the end, when House Intelligence  Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif., repeatedly pressed him to agree that the matter needed to be investigated. READ THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT READ THE TRANSCRIPT OF TRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL Maguire stressed that the committee had all of the relevant information, including the whistleblower complaint, released publicly Thursday morning, and said it's up to its members to decide how to proceed. Maguire also stressed that the complaint essentially was ""hearsay,"" not ""corroborated by other folks."" On Wednesday, the White House  released a transcript  of Trump's July call with Zelensky, showing Trump sought a review of former Vice President Joe Biden's efforts to have Ukraine's former top prosecutor fired. Zelensky, speaking with Trump later in the day, said he did not feel pressured at all during the call to investigate Biden. Joe Biden  has acknowledged   on camera  that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm  Burisma Holdings  — where Biden's son Hunter had a  highly lucrative role  on the board. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden supporters say Shokin was widely accused of corruption. On the flipside,  critics charged  that Hunter Biden essentially might have been selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. Trump made the request on the call for Ukraine to look into the Bidens after Zelensky first mentioned Ukraine's corruption issues, and after Trump separately requested as a ""favor"" that Ukraine  help investigate foreign interference in the 2016 elections , including the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server involving CrowdStrike. The call came not long after Trump had frozen millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine. However, the aid was later released to Ukraine, and the Ukrainians  were unaware  the money was frozen in the first place until more than a month after Trump's call with Zelensky, according to  The New York Times.  Fox News' John Roberts and Brooke Singman contributed to this report."
"A handful of Democrats who have spent Trump's presidency warning against the consequences of a distracting impeachment inquiry have used the latest allegations -- where Trump  admitted  to discussing his possible 2020 political rival Joe Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- to signal a ""tipping point."" While most left some wiggle room in their stance on impeachment, Democratic Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota issued a statement saying she is ""immediately"" calling for proceedings. ""We must safeguard our electoral process and our very democracy from outside threats. For this reason, the current investigations into corruption must continue. And when there is an abuse of power of this magnitude, it is our responsibility to stand up for what is right. This is why I am calling to open impeachment proceedings -- immediately, fairly, and impartially."" In a  Washington Post op-ed published Monday night,  seven freshman Democrats wrote that ""if these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense."" ""We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly, and we call on our colleagues in Congress to consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us, including the power of 'inherent contempt' and impeachment hearings, to address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security,"" the op-ed read.  The move by the freshman Democrats -- Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia -- marks a notable escalation from a group of lawmakers who are vulnerable in the 2020 election. Crow had previously called for an impeachment inquiry earlier in the summer, but the other lawmakers were signaling their potential openness for the first time. Sherrill said on CNN's ""New Day"" Tuesday that ""none of us ran on impeaching the President"" and noted her concern that impeachment would shift focus from her constituents' needs, citing fixes to health care and taxes. ""Quite frankly, in my district, it is not enough to impeach the President. In fact, many people probably won't agree with my decision,"" Sherrill said. But she argued that the allegation that Trump might have tried leveraging foreign military aid to advance his reelection efforts ""crossed a line"" for her and the six other freshmen Democrats. ""I think we all understood the implications of this right away. Many of us, if not all of us, have worked overseas. We've worked with foreign governments. We've worked to protect our national security and democracy, so this was a red line. We coalesced on this very quickly,"" Sherrill said of the group's decision to pen the op-ed. Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he discussed Biden in a July call with Ukraine's president. CNN  has previously reported  that Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the inspector general of the intelligence community in August. The complaint hasn't been shared with lawmakers, despite Democratic calls for the acting director of national intelligence to comply with a legal requirement to do so. Rep. Vincente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who has thus far resisted calling for Trump's impeachment, told CNN on Monday that he would reconsider his position if the administration  does not turn over the whistleblower complaint  regarding the President and Ukraine to the House Intelligence Committee this week. Speaking to CNN's Poppy Harlow on Monday, Gonzalez said if Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for a reopening of an investigation into Biden's son, he would support an impeachment inquiry. Trump has admitted to discussing Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son, Hunter. ""I don't think we have a choice under the Constitution. We must move forward with impeachment proceedings. I don't think we'll have much of a choice,"" Gonzalez said.  Gonzalez reiterated his stance in statement to CNN following the interview, saying he would ""seriously consider joining the calls to open an impeachment inquiry"" if the complaint isn't handed over. Rep. Dean Phillips, a Minnesota freshman Democrat who has also not embraced impeachment, said Monday that Democrats ""must pursue articles of impeachment and report them to the full House of Representatives for immediate consideration"" if reports about the whistleblower complaint are corroborated.  ""This continues a pattern of behavior that is corrupt at best, treasonous at worst, and puts our rule of law at risk,"" Phillips said in a statement. ""Our Constitution transcends any person, politician, or political party, and I call on the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Judiciary Committees to use every legal mechanism possible to obtain all relevant evidence."" And Rep. Stephen Lynch, a Massachusetts Democrat who has long pushed against pursuing impeachment, separately said on Monday that the complaint could lead to impeachment, calling the situation ""deeply concerning.""  ""If fully substantiated, it will be of momentous consequence, including the possibility of initiating impeachment proceedings,"" Lynch said in a statement. As recently as last month, he was  arguing  that conducting impeachment proceedings would hand Trump another four years in the White House. In a news release Monday night, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, said she has been reluctant to call for impeachment, but ""these actions regarding the 2020 election are a turning point."" Impeachment, she said, ""may be the only recourse Congress has"" if Trump is enlisting foreign help in the 2020 election. RELATED: House Democrats near 'tipping point' on impeachment as Pelosi faces crucial week Their comments came after House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff  told  CNN's Jake Tapper over the weekend that Trump may have ""crossed the Rubicon"" and impeachment could be ""the only remedy"" equal to the offense. The controversy surrounding Trump's dealings with Ukraine has added fuel to already-heated discussions among Democrats about whether to pursue impeachment. The House Judiciary Committee is conducting an investigation to determine whether or not to recommend articles of impeachment, but Democratic leaders are  divided  about the issue. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has thus far resisted calls to launch such proceedings over concern that an impeachment push would be dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate and would imperil Democrats' 2020 election chances. Pelosi,  in a letter  to all members of Congress over the weekend, said that the standoff could escalate Democrats' ongoing investigation into Trump. ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" she wrote. But some lawmakers say they are hearing from constituents who want to see Democrats take action beyond just more investigation, and soon. ""Phones have been ringing all day with constituents calling to tell me they support impeachment, particularly following the President's corrupt dealings with Ukraine,"" Virginia Rep. Don Beyer  wrote  on Twitter Monday. ""They are right."" This story has been updated with additional developments Monday."
"WASHINGTON — President Trump pressed the Ukrainian president in a July call to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son, according to a person familiar with the conversation, an apparently blatant mixture of foreign policy with his 2020 re-election campaign. Mr. Trump also repeatedly told the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, to talk with his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had been urging the government in Kiev to investigate Mr. Biden and his family, according to two other people briefed on the call. Mr. Trump’s request is part of the secret whistle-blower complaint that is said to be about Mr. Trump and at least in part about  his dealings with Ukraine , according to two people familiar with the complaint. Mr. Biden is a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. The president has made no secret that he wanted Ukraine to investigate any improper overlap between Mr. Biden’s own diplomatic efforts there and his son’s role with a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. “Someone ought to look into Joe Biden,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday in response to a question about his call with Mr. Zelensky. The revelations added urgency to questions about Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, which is battling Russian-controlled separatists in the country’s east. When the president sought the Biden investigation, the Trump administration’s military aid to Ukraine had been frozen for weeks. The United States suspended that assistance in early July, according to a former American official. Mr. Trump did not discuss the aid in the July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky, whose government did not learn of the suspension until August, according to people familiar with the call. The Wall Street Journal  first reported  details of the call. For Democrats who want to examine the whistle-blower complaint — itself the subject of  an internal administration dispute  over whether to hand it over to Congress, as is generally required by law — the key question is whether Mr. Trump was demanding a quid pro quo, explicitly or implicitly. Democratic House committee chairmen  are already investigating  whether he manipulated American foreign policy for personal political advantage and have requested the transcript of the Zelensky call. The growing controversy had echoes of the dominant scandal of the first years of Mr. Trump’s administration: whether his campaign sought help from Russia to benefit him in 2016. Ultimately,  the special counsel found  that although “insufficient evidence” existed to determine that Mr. Trump or his advisers engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the Russians, his campaign welcomed Moscow’s election sabotage and expected to benefit from it. Any attempt by Mr. Trump to ask a foreign power to “dig up dirt” on a political rival while withholding aid is corrupt, said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, one of the panels examining Mr. Trump’s Ukraine dealings. “No explicit quid pro quo is necessary to betray your country,”  tweeted Mr. Schiff , who has also pushed for the whistle-blower complaint to be given to Congress. Mr. Trump opened a direct counterattack on Friday against the whistle-blower, whose identity is unknown, as are many details about the complaint. The president dismissed the allegations and labeled the whistle-blower, without evidence, a political partisan. “It’s a ridiculous story. It’s a partisan whistle-blower,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, though he acknowledged he did not know the person’s identity. “They shouldn’t even have information.” Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have pressed for an investigation of the Bidens for weeks, after reports this year in  The New York Times  and  elsewhere  examined whether a Ukrainian energy company sought to buy influence in Washington by hiring Mr. Biden’s younger son, Hunter Biden. The younger Biden had a lobbying business in Ukraine while his father was vice president. When he was vice president, Mr. Biden cast himself as both the Obama administration’s advocate of military assistance to Kiev as well as the chief antagonist of the notorious corruption in Ukraine’s government. In early 2016, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in American loan guarantees if Ukraine’s top prosecutor was not dismissed after accusations that he had ignored rampant corruption. Mr. Biden succeeded; the prosecutor general was voted out office. And Hunter Biden had an interest in the outcome: He sat on the board of an energy company that had been in the sights of the ousted prosecutor general. On Friday, the former vice president accused Mr. Trump in a statement of using the power of the United States to extract “a political favor.” Mr. Biden called for the president to release the transcript of his call with Mr. Zelensky and said that if the reports about it proved true, “there was no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.” He also said the allegations that he or his son committed wrongdoing in Ukraine were baseless. “Not one single outlet has given any credibility to his assertion,” Mr. Biden told reporters after a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Controversy over the Trump administration’s Ukraine policy has swirled for weeks but has been confined mostly to foreign policy experts. The revelations about the whistle-blower complaint plunged the issue into the center of the political debate. Congress has still not seen the whistle-blower’s allegation. Although the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, has sought to provide it, the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has blocked him in  a dispute over legal requirements . Mr. Maguire and his general counsel decided against providing the complaint to Congress after consulting with Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, according to a person familiar with the move. Mounting evidence that the White House was involved in the effort to withhold the complaint from lawmakers has stirred anger on Capitol Hill. Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Mr. Maguire of violating the law. “If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,” she added in a statement. Republicans were largely silent about Mr. Trump’s calls for a foreign investigation of his political rival. Their apparent desire to avoid criticizing the president during a political crisis stood in contrast to the criticism from party members after the administration froze aid to Ukraine. The administration, critics said, has struggled to explain the move, which has convinced some Democrats that it was part of an effort bring about a Biden investigation. “They have no shame,” said Michael Carpenter, a former aide to Mr. Biden and expert on Ukraine. He added: “They released the assistance in mid-September after the bipartisan uproar over the freeze — and under pressure from the House investigations. But strikingly, the administration never articulated why the assistance was frozen in the first place.” Mr. Giuliani has spearheaded a push for a Biden inquiry. He  met with Mr. Zelensky’s emissaries  this summer in hopes of encouraging his government to pursue investigations into the family as well as whether Ukrainian officials took steps during the 2016 election to damage Mr. Trump’s campaign. Mr. Giuliani has said he was acting on his own, though his comments on Thursday seemed to draw a closer connection to Mr. Trump. “A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job,”  Mr. Giuliani tweeted  shortly after  an appearance on CNN,  where he first denied, then admitted, asking the government in Kiev to investigate the Bidens. Although they agreed to meet with Mr. Giuliani, the Ukrainians have so far refused to open the investigations. But there is little doubt the pressure from Mr. Trump is causing stress on the new government, according to a former Ukrainian official. Since 2014, Ukraine has been under attack by Russia and its proxy, a fight that has become a grinding conflict that has made it difficult for Kiev to continue its overhaul efforts and work to become more integrated with Europe and the West. But now Ukraine also finds itself potentially at odds with the leader of its most critical partner, the United States, and at the center of a political battle in Washington. Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky  will meet next week  on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, a senior administration official confirmed on Friday after Mr. Zelensky’s office announced the meeting. But the administration has put off any commitment for a White House meeting, which Mr. Zelensky views as critical for the relationship."
"The announcement marks the most direct step taken by the House Democratic leader to embrace impeachment proceedings and is a significant escalation in the fight between House Democrats and the President. ""Today, I am announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,"" Pelosi said in a brief speech in the Capitol, adding, ""The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law."" ""Actions taken to date by the President have seriously violated the Constitution,"" the House speaker said. The House speaker, who has long pushed to keep her caucus away from the politically divisive issue, is responding to the seismic shift among Democratic members, following Trump's admission of discussing Vice President Joe Biden and his son in his phone call with the Ukrainian President. Dozens of House Democrats -- many from moderate or Trump-won districts -- have announced their support for an impeachment inquiry over the past 48 hours.  ""This week, the President has admitted to asking the President of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically. The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said in her public remarks.  In advance of that statement, Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer also announced plans to vote on a resolution of disapproval on Wednesday for allegations ""that the President of the United States sought to enlist a foreign government to interfere in our democratic process by investigating one of his political rivals -- and may have used the withholding of Congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance days earlier as intimidation."" Their statement did not mention impeachment. 'Full speed ahead' Pelosi consulted Tuesday afternoon with the six House Democratic leaders to discuss their presentation to the caucus later in the day, Democratic sources familiar with the issue said. In that closed-door meeting before her public announcement, Pelosi said the six chairmen will continue to investigate under a powerful new umbrella of an impeachment inquiry.  A separate source in the room said the speaker added, ""Here we are. A moment of truth. Truth is what this has been about all along.""  ""He's taken it to another level of betrayal therefore we're moving forward with another level of inquiry,"" Pelosi said.  Behind the scenes, Pelosi has encouraged members of her caucus to state their impeachment position now in order to show there is a groundswell in the caucus. She is also conveying that message to freshmen. On Tuesday, Pelosi also told the caucus that the impeachment inquiry will be done ""expeditiously,"" but wasn't specific in her timeframe, according to a source in the room. Rep. Jackie Speier told CNN that the President's actions in regards to Ukraine were so egregious, that there has been a ""dramatic"" shift by Pelosi. ""I think she's very laser-focused on this offense as being so egregious that it warrants a full blown impeachment inquiry,"" she said. Asked what the timeline is for this, she said, ""swiftly.""  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said on Tuesday after Pelosi's remarks, ""I only have one thing to say, full speed ahead."" Tide changing for Pelosi allies and vulnerable House freshmen Civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis on Tuesday announced his support for impeachment proceedings, arguing that ""now is the time to act"" and any delay ""would betray the foundation of our democracy."" ""We will never find the truth unless we use the power given to the House of Representatives and the House alone to begin an official investigation as dictated by the Constitution,"" the Georgia Democrat  said in a speech on the House floor . ""The future of our democracy is at stake."" Some of Pelosi's closest allies, including House Reps. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Debbie Dingell of Michigan, have signaled their support for impeachment proceedings — a significant indicator that the speaker could be moving closer to backing the divisive political procedure. Another crucial development has been multiple high profile freshmen Democrats in districts Trump won in 2016 either coming out publicly to fully endorse the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry or at least  opening the door to proceedings , citing Trump's actions as forcing them to act.  One of those freshman Democrats, Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, stressed on CNN ""New Day"" Tuesday that ""none of us ran on impeaching the President."" But she argued that the allegation that Trump might have tried leveraging foreign military aid to advance his reelection efforts was ""just a line that I think was too much for all of us."" Pelosi has cited the House members in GOP-leaning districts as part of her hesitance to embrace impeachment, and the groundswell of statements over the past 48 hours could signal a tipping point in the political calculus.  ""If investigations confirm recent reports, these actions represent impeachable offences that threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections and jeopardize the balance of power within the federal government,"" Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan said in a statement Tuesday. Stevens had told  CNN last month  that she had ""mixed reviews from the people of my district"" on the issue of whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings.  So far, as many as  165 House Democrats  have publicly stated their support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, according to a CNN count, and that doesn't include the House Democrats who've said in recent days that the President's behavior is a turning point in Democrats' oversight into the administration.  Pelosi has, for months, resisted pursuing impeachment because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash.  Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a member of House Judiciary, told CNN on Tuesday morning that he believes articles of impeachment are ""inevitable"" and said there's a ""growing clamor throughout the Democratic caucus"" to deal with Trump's ""reckless and lawless"" behavior. Some holdouts remain But some vulnerable Democrats in 2020 are still treading cautiously on the issue. Rep. Ben McAdams of Utah told CNN on Tuesday that he's ""considering"" impeachment, but didn't want to discuss the issue further. ""Before making any judgments, I want to know the facts of what occurred between the President and Ukraine,"" McAdams said. ""I share Sen. (Mitt) Romney's view that If the President used his position to pressure a foreign power to dig up dirt on a rival for his own personal gain, it would be deeply troubling. I believe it would be a betrayal of the loyalty owed to our country and the Constitution."" Rep. Max Rose, another endangered House Democrat, told CNN that he has not moved off his opposition to impeachment, but argued that ""we have to get to the facts"" of the allegations. ""It is impossible to not take these allegations seriously. It is a national security matter,"" the New York Democrat said Tuesday on Capitol Hill, adding, ""It's incredibly serious ... what I'm not going to do is jump to make another declaration."" Asked if that meant he is opposed to moving ahead on impeachment, Rose said, ""My current position right now is clear, but that is not a justification to not take these points as seriously as possible."" Rep. Susan Wild stood up during the Democratic caucus meeting on Tuesday and argued that Pelosi should cancel some of the upcoming two week recess to not lose momentum, according to a source in the room. The House, at the end of the week, will recess for two weeks for a district work period over the Yom Kippur and Columbus Day holidays. CNN  previously reported  that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation.  There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. That call was also part of a  whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, which hasn't been shared with lawmakers despite calls from Democrats.  Trump  acknowledged on Sunday  that he discussed the former Vice President Joe Biden in a phone call over the summer with Ukraine's president, but denied doing anything improper. CNN confirmed that Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before a call with Zelensky, two senior administration officials said on Monday. The  Washington Post  first reported this. In her public remarks on Tuesday, Pelosi said, ""The law is unequivocal: it says the DNI, director of national intelligence, shall provide congress the full whistleblower complaint,"" Pelosi said. Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee approved a resolution defining the rules of the panel's impeachment investigation. That vote came, however, as Democrats struggled to publicly define the committee probe with Nadler saying the committee is conducting an impeachment inquiry, while Pelosi and other Democratic leaders had refrained from calling it that. In a nod to the ongoing investigations in the House, Pelosi said on Tuesday, ""For the past several months we have been investigating in our committees and litigating in the courts so that the House can gather all the relevant facts and consider whether to exercise its full Article I powers, including a constitutional power of the utmost gravity, approval of articles of impeachment."" The House Speaker also said in her speech, ""I can say with authority the Trump administration's actions undermine both our national security and our intelligence and our protections of whistleblowers."" This story is breaking and will be updated."
"Sitting in a Manhattan hotel meeting room, the men eagerly sought to deflect questions of wrongdoing after a White House transcript released earlier in the day showed Trump pressing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. The call has formed the basis for Democrats' impeachment probe, and has thrown Trump's presidency into turmoil. But as camera shutters whirred, Trump and Zelensky insisted nothing was untoward.  ""There was no pressure,"" Trump insisted, denying allegations he was using his position of power to prod Ukraine into investigating a political rival. ""Nobody pushed me,"" Zelensky chimed in, denying he felt coerced by Trump to launch a probe. Instead, he suggested he was an unwilling participant in an American political firestorm. ""I'm sorry but I don't want to be involved (in) democratic open elections of USA,"" he said after consulting with a translator. It may be too late for that. The controversy over Trump's dealings with Zelensky have massed into a political and diplomatic watershed, with Ukraine squarely in the center. Trump remained defiant during a rambling Wednesday afternoon news conference that he ""didn't threaten anybody.""  ""No push, no pressure, no nothing,"" Trump said. ""It's all a hoax, folks.""  Trump added, ""I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo. But there was with Biden and there was with the senators."" He said he's told House Republicans he wants ""full transparency on the so-called whistleblower information,"" but continued to peddle conspiracy theories about Biden and his son. He also challenged the credibility of the whistleblower's claims. Trump claimed the individual -- who has not been identified -- ""didn't have any first-class or first-rate or second-tier information from what I understand."" The President told reporters he's willing to release a transcript of another, earlier call with Zelensky, as well as any calls between Ukraine and Vice President Mike Pence.  ""I'll release that, too, if that's important to you,"" Trump said of a call which preceded the July 25 conversation the public learned more about today through a newly released transcript. ""I spoke to him previous to the call that we released."" The mid-afternoon meeting between Trump and Zelensky   was arranged well before the whistleblower controversy exploded into public view, according to people familiar with the plans. Aides initially did not view it as a major highlight of Trump's agenda at this week's United Nations meetings, which they expected would focus heavily on Iran and not on the questions of abuse of power. When news emerged that an intelligence whistleblower had filed a complaint related to Trump and Ukraine -- and later that it was related to Trump's July phone call with Zelensky -- White House officials began to view the meeting as an important venue for Trump to counter Democratic accusations of wrongdoing. Trump began by making light of the matter, telling reporters that Zelensky ""made me more famous and I've made him more famous."" And later his attention seemed to drift, recalling his onetime ownership of the Miss Universe pageant, won once by a Ukrainian contestant. But the mood turned grave as Zelensky -- himself a former television personality whose entry into politics was as unlikely as Trump's -- raised Russia's annexation of Crimea. ""If you remember, you lost Crimea during a different administration. Not during the Trump administration,"" Trump insisted, ascribing the invasion to his predecessor Barack Obama. Asked whether he wants Zelensky to do more to investigate Biden, Trump said, ""No, I want him to do whatever he can."" The evening before the meeting, Trump and Zelensky greeted each other at a diplomatic reception hosted by the American President for fellow leaders visiting New York for the annual United Nations meetings. A photo posted by Zelensky on Twitter showed the two men with their spouses smiling broadly, without a hint of the controversy that now overhangs their relationship. There have been conversations between US and Ukrainian officials this week about the matter, including over whether to release the log of the July phone call. One official said there had not been extensive conversations between US and Ukrainian officials about what each leader would say during the open-press part of Wednesday's meeting, though they could not rule out more informal discussions, namely between Trump and Zelensky during the diplomatic reception or between Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and his Ukrainian interlocutors. Speaking during the meeting, Trump praised Giuliani, his private attorney, for pushing Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden, saying he was demonstrating admirable verve. ""Rudy Giuliani is a great lawyer, he was a great mayor, he's highly respected. I've watched the passion he's had on television over the last few days. Incredible what he's done,"" Trump said. The sit-down between Trump and Zelensky on Wednesday was not originally meant to be their first meeting. Trump had agreed to meet Zelensky earlier this month in Poland, where he was planning to commemorate the anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. When a hurricane forced him to cancel his plans,  Mike Pence went in his place and met with Zelensky in Warsaw . Afterward, Pence was asked whether the Biden matter arose in the talks. He said no, but did turn quickly to the issue of corruption in Ukraine. Trump and Zelensky have spoken by phone twice: once immediately following Ukrainian elections in April, and again in July. The latter conversation has become the focal point for Democrats after an intelligence whistleblower raised concerns about Ukraine and Russia. In the months following Zelensky's election, Trump showed little interest in meeting him, believing Ukraine to be an intractably corrupt country. He ascribed Russia's annexation of part of the country to his predecessor, who he repeatedly blamed for ""losing"" Crimea. But as Giuliani began raising the issue of Biden and his son, Trump's interest was piqued. He was also convinced by top national security aides, including then-national security adviser John Bolton, that engaging the new leader would be valuable in countering Russia. Bolton was also among those aides pushing Trump to approve an aid package worth millions of dollars to Ukraine after it was put on hold. That package -- and whether it was used as a bargaining chip in Trump's attempts to push an investigation into the Bidens -- has become a lynchpin in the impeachment inquiry."

"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — College students are back on campus.  Bernie Sanders  is, too. Earlier this month at Iowa State University, he lectured to young voters as they played “Green New Deal Pong” (the  Solo cups  were filled with green-colored water) and “Bern Bag Toss.”  At the University of Nevada, Reno,  he croaked through a hoarse voice to address a crowd that stretched from the college lawn to the open-air floors of a  parking garage beside it. And at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Thursday evening, he implored students to get themselves to the primary polls come February — and vote for him. “You have friends out there, and I know you do, who think that the political system” is absurd, he said, using a colorful expletive. “Tell them that instead of just complaining, they must get involved into the political process.” It was a sentiment he has repeated often this month as he crisscrossed the country on what has amounted to a whirlwind back-to-school tour. In Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina, he has by turns used flattery (“Your generation is the most progressive younger generation in the history of this country”) and subtle warnings (“The future of this country and in fact the world rests with your generation”) to bolster his appeals. Everywhere, his goal was the same: muster a version of the army of young voters who propelled his campaign in 2016. His message was one that has resonated with Brianna Williams, 19, who arrived with a group of friends to hear him in Chapel Hill .  “I’ve seen a lot of his policies, and I’m just excited for what he has to offer as a candidate,” she said. But she was just as excited by Senator Elizabeth Warren. “I would love to see a woman running the country,” she said. “That would be really cool.” Last time around, Mr. Sanders’s rants against the elite and promises of free college tuition endeared him to legions of young fans. It also helped that Mr. Sanders —  74  at the time, with unruly white hair and an old-school Brooklyn accent — was both decidedly uncool and new to presidential politics, affording his campaign a paradoxical edge that inspired millions of young supporters to “feel the bern” and vote for him over Hillary Clinton.  As he fights anew for the Democratic nomination, it is not lost on him or his allies that his success hinges, in no small part, on his ability to capture that enthusiasm again —  for both the optics of his race and the actual votes.   But this time he is no longer an insurgent, nor is he the only anti-establishment candidate in the race — factors that helped boost his standing among young voters. With the race entering the crucial fall period, other candidates, including Ms. Warren and Andrew Yang, have begun siphoning off some of his support. [ Sign up for our politics newsletter  hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race. ] Even Mr. Sanders’s closest advisers acknowledge that he cannot take for granted a voting cohort they view as critical, even if it is traditionally unreliable in actually making it to the ballot box. “Last time it was much more organic,” Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, said. “And this time it’s far more intentional.” In interviews, many young voters still praised Mr. Sanders, sometimes breathlessly — citing his authenticity and conviction but also his calls for free college and universal health care and his proposal to cancel student debt. But many also expressed curiosity, if not exuberance, about other candidates  “I love everything he stands for,” said Asha Loutsch, 18, as she sat with a circle of friends who were waiting for his event at the University of Iowa. “I think he really cares about what he’s trying to say. Like, he’s always getting up in there, you know?” But she also said she was interested in Ms. Warren and wanted to hear her speak. Jiego Lim, an 18-year-old student at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was volunteering at Mr. Sanders’s event there, said he supported Mr. Sanders but was also intrigued by Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris. “I feel like we need a fresh new face in politics,” he said. “Bernie comes off aggressive to me sometimes.” Others were less equivocal.  “He’s America’s dad,” offered Gabriel Olier, 19, a student in Reno. “I love Bernie.” That affection for Mr. Sanders is reflected in some more tangible metrics. His campaign said it had so far raised over $1 million from people under the age of 25, a relatively small figure compared to his overall haul but one that nevertheless points to his continued strength with young voters. [ Here’s the latest data  on who’s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] And in most polls, Mr. Sanders still maintains a strong lead among young voters:  A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey  showed that a third of voters under 35 supported him. Yet at the same time, a quarter of these respondents said they supported Ms. Warren , suggesting Mr. Sanders no longer has the same hold on the group he had in 2016. Any candidate relying on the support of younger voters faces an undeniable challenge: Younger voters tend not to vote in high numbers compared with other groups. In the 2016 election, for instance, only  11 percent of voters  under 30 participated in the Iowa caucuses, representing just 15 percent of the total, according to an estimate from the  Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and  Engagement   at Tufts University. But the high turnout among young voters during the 2018 midterm elections has given some experts hope that the 2020 election will be different. That strong showing has provided organizers with a larger pool to identify and target potential presidential voters. Issues, including climate change, criminal justice, health care and gun control, are also motivating young voters to act. “The truth is that if younger people in this country voted at the same level as people 65 and over, we could transform this country,” Mr. Sanders said this month at the University of Iowa. “Please do it!” John Della Volpe , the director of polling at Harvard’s  Institute of Politics , said that Mr. Sanders was still “doing really well” but that the field was more complex and his pool of support was smaller. “At this stage, he’s essentially sharing support of young people in most polls with Elizabeth Warren,” Mr. Della Volpe said. “The idea of going after structural reforms is really, I think, what is resonating so clearly with young people.” Indeed, of all the other candidates, it is Ms. Warren who appears to be generating the most powerful wave of energy among young voters in Democratic presidential politics — particularly among those who once supported Mr. Sanders. Olivia Stecklein, 19, a student at the University of Iowa, said she had been a fan of Mr. Sanders since 2015 but was now choosing between him and Ms. Warren. “I feel like they’re pretty similar, but I just kind of like how Elizabeth Warren has a set-out plan for everything,” she said. “She just seems very prepared.” Eliza Link, 18, a University of Iowa student, said she was also deciding between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. “I think they’re both the cool aunt and uncle of the political race right now,” she said. With his characteristic verve that can exhaust even young reporters, Mr. Sanders has been in an all-out sprint to earn the vote of the youths, months before any of them can even cast their vote.  His team set up a Bernie Summer School program to train campus leaders in the art of campaigning. He urged his campaign to get him back on college campuses in the first weeks of the new school year. He constantly asks his team to share data on young voters. To win over the group, however, Mr. Sanders will have to convince people like Tim Watts, 19. Before Mr. Sanders’s event in Reno, Mr. Watts wore a “MATH” hat, the universal accessory of Yang supporters. But despite his overt support for Mr. Yang — who in some ways is benefiting from the outsider status among young voters that Mr. Sanders enjoyed in 2016 — Mr. Watts said he had not yet closed the door on Mr. Sanders. “I’m part of the Yang gang, I guess,” he said. “I will probably feel the bern later.” Rachel Shorey contributed reporting from Washington."
"Only one in three of these staffers are covered, compared to 63% of workers at other companies. Workers at companies with many lower-wage employees are less likely to be eligible, according to  Kaiser's annual employer health benefits study , released Wednesday. They also have to pay more for these plans. Only two-thirds qualify for benefits, compared to 81% at other firms. And these staffers pay annual premiums that average $7,050 versus just under $6,000 elsewhere. ""These folks don't have a lot of money so the contribution becomes pretty expensive for them,"" said Gary Claxton, a senior vice president at Kaiser. The  2020 Democratic primary campaign  has put a spotlight on employer-based plans, which cover about 153 million Americans. Candidates such as former Vice President Joe Biden are defending the current system, while progressives such as Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren want to move to a national, government-run health insurance system to ensure that everyone is covered. The share of Americans covered by employer polices has been drifting downward over the past two decades, though it has stabilized in recent years amid the good economy. Still, Claxton noted, it's not rising even though unemployment is at a record low. Although the poverty rate fell and 2.3 million more Americans found jobs last year,  the share covered by private insurance  did not statistically change, according to a recent US Census Bureau report. That indicates that low-income people are not landing positions with benefits. The Democratic debate over whether to maintain  employer-sponsored coverage  comes at a time of relatively slow growth in health care costs.  Annual family premiums rose 5% to roughly $20,600 this year, Kaiser found. Employers pick up about $14,600 of the tab. Still, the cost of coverage has risen far faster than earnings or inflation over the past decade. Family premiums have increased 54% and workers' contributions have jumped 71%. By contrast, wages are up 26% and inflation 20%. Deductibles, meanwhile, stayed roughly flat at an average of $1,655 for single coverage among workers who face a deductible. But that's up from an average of $826 a decade ago. ""The single biggest issue in health care for most Americans is that their health costs are growing much faster than their wages are,"" said Drew Altman, Kaiser's chief executive."

"But these are not ordinary times. On April 21, US President Donald  Trump spoke by phone with Ukrainian president-elect  Volodymyr Zelensky, who had just won a resounding victory at the polls. Kurt Volker, the US Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations, described it as a routine congratulatory call. But within days of Zelensky's win,  the New York Times  published a story that resurfaced questions about Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in Ukraine. At the center of the story -- pushed in good part by  Rudy Giuliani , Trump's lawyer and political attack dog -- was the role of Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma, a natural gas company. The Bidens and Burisma were the focus of a July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, a conversation that spurred a whistleblower complaint. ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,"" Trump said, according to notes prepared by staff in the White House situation room. Trump was referring to investigations into Burisma, following on the insinuation -- an unproven one -- that Joe Biden tried to have Ukraine's top prosecutor ousted in 2016 to stop investigations of Burisma, to benefit his son. That version of events has not held up: Burisma had indeed been investigated, but at least one former official in the Ukraine prosecutor's office said the investigation into Burisma had already been shelved by the time  Joe Biden lobbied  for the  replacement of Ukraine's prosecutor. Still, in the July 25 call, Zelensky appeared to promise to have a new prosecutor look into the case. ""Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September,"" he said, according to the transcript. Whether the Ukrainian government will deliver what Trump wants -- an investigation of the Bidens -- remains to be seen. A prominent Ukrainian lawmaker told CNN Thursday that a new investigation of a Ukrainian firm at the heart of a growing US political scandal would not involve Joe or Hunter Biden. Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, a leading parliamentarian and a former head of Ukraine's domestic intelligence agency, told CNN prosecutors were looking to open an investigation into Burisma. Nalyvaichenko added, however, that the role of Hunter Biden would not be examined, as far as he was aware, and that Joe Biden's efforts during his tenure as vice president to dismiss a former Ukrainian prosecutor general will not form part of the restarted investigation.  ""This investigation is about Ukraine's corruption at the top,"" Nalyvaichenko said. ""It is about getting to the truth for Ukrainians.""  The Ukrainian Prosecutor General's office has not said whether a probe of Burisma had been reopened, and declined comment to CNN. Previous probes into Burisma by Ukrainian prosecutors over the years have been dropped or gone dormant. Hunter Biden no longer works for Burisma. The Ukrainian government, it appears, will be walking a fine line in reopening a probe of Burisma."
"The impeachment push from  House Democrats  is likely to ""blow up in the faces of Democrats and the media like an exploding cigar,"" Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett predicted on  ""Fox & Friends""  Wednesday. Jarrett, who has authored an upcoming book called ""Witch Hunt,"" asked why House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi  did not wait 24 hours before her ""impeachment gesture."" He noted that the director of national intelligence is set to testify Thursday before Congress on the whistleblower complaint stemming from  President Trump  pressuring the president of Ukraine to investigate his potential opponent in the 2020 election, Joe Biden. PELOSI ANNOUNCES IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY -- WILL IT BACKFIRE? ""We know from his lawyer's letter that the whistleblower isn't a whistleblower because the complaint, under the law, isn't recognized as a whistleblower complaint. You can't whistle-blow on the president. The law is very clear, you can only blow the whistle on someone in the intelligence community,"" said Jarrett, adding that the president is not a member of the intelligence community. Meantime, a senior White House official  told Fox News late Tuesday  that the administration will release a document showing the intelligence community inspector general found the whistleblower had “political bias” in favor of “a rival candidate” of the president. The official did not identify the name of the rival candidate. Separately, a senior administration official told Fox News the White House has been working as quickly as it can to release to Congress the whistleblower complaint involving President Trump's conversations with the leader of Ukraine, as long as it's legally possible. FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED The news came just hours after Pelosi  initiated a formal impeachment  inquiry  by alleging that the administration was hiding the complaint. Other top Democrats  had previously said  such an inquiry was already underway. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Jarrett said the ""AOC crowd"" – referring to  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y., and her liberal supporters –""forced [Pelosi's] hand"" in moving toward an impeachment inquiry. ""I think this is all going to blow up negatively for Joe Biden,"" said Jarrett, accusing the media of ignoring the story behind Biden, his  son's business dealings  and Biden's demands for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor. Fox News' Gregg Re, John Roberts and Ed Henry contributed to this report."
"Pelosi,  who sharpened her rhetoric over the weekend , is still not committing to moving forward with impeachment proceedings -- but she is feeling the tide turn. In a brief interview with CNN as she flew from New York to Washington Monday, Pelosi again declined to say whether she would fully endorse initiating an impeachment inquiry when she meets with committee chairmen and members of the Democratic caucus on Tuesday. But she left little doubt the developments around the whistleblower's complaint had dramatically escalated the standoff with President Donald Trump and a move toward impeachment proceedings was all but certain.  ""We will have no choice,"" Pelosi said of ultimately initiating an impeachment inquiry. She did not say whether the move toward impeachment could be slowed if the White House provided the whistleblower's report. During the flight, Pelosi read a  Washington Post op-ed  from seven freshman Democrats who made the case for impeachment.  She said she had advance notice the lawmakers were planning to join forces to collectively argue the president's actions ""represent an impeachable offense.""  ""It will be a big week,"" Pelosi said. The reason: The substance of the complaint is not yet clear. And it's still unclear how the Trump administration will respond.  Multiple Democratic sources told CNN that if the White House completely stonewalls Democrats for the information, it will make the calculus easier for moving forward with impeachment proceedings. But if the White House provides a  transcript, or seeks to muddy the waters in its response, that could make it more challenging for Democrats to unify behind impeachment, even  after President Donald Trump's admission  of discussing Vice President Joe Biden and his son in his phone call with the Ukrainian leader. That's why this week is critical for House Democrats to decide which course to take. They are awaiting to see how the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, responds during Thursday's high-stakes hearing before the House Intelligence Committee -- and whether the administration provides any more details about Trump's conversations with Ukrainian leaders or the substance of the whistleblower complaint. Plus, Pelosi and House Democratic leaders are waiting to see how members respond --  particularly ones in difficult races who represent GOP-leaning districts  -- to see if it's time to move ahead. Pelosi, a savvy vote counter, has no desire to move forward with impeachment if it lacks 218 votes in the House, Democratic sources say, and before the Ukraine controversy, it is almost certain that the House Democrats would have fallen well short of that majority threshold. That could change depending on how the latest controversy shakes out.  The House Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon, according to three Democratic sources. A leadership aide told CNN that the topic is likely to be about the next steps on investigations.   ""The dominant focus of the caucus on Wednesday is trade, a second caucus has been added to ensure adequate time for member discussion on the whistleblower matter and a number of other pressing matters on Tuesday afternoon,"" a Democratic leadership aide said in a statement Monday evening. 'When are Democrats going to get tough?' The impeachment fight remains a divisive issue in the party as Democratic leaders continue their investigations into the Trump administration -- including a new subpoena threat from a trio of House chairmen -- following a steady stream of developments on the issue over the past couple days.  Democrats, including freshmen from Trump districts and moderates who have resisted calls for impeachment, are telling their colleagues privately they are prepared to announce their support for impeachment proceedings if the controversy continues to grow -- namely if there's evidence that Trump sought to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigating the Bidens, according to Democratic sources involved in the conversations.  That could change the calculus for Pelosi, who has in part resisted moving forward on impeachment because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash over impeachment. But if those members come out in support of impeachment proceedings, Pelosi is bound to shift her positioning as well, according to Democrats close to the speaker. ""I think we're reaching a tipping point both within our base and within our caucus,"" Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat on the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, told CNN on Monday. ""This weekend, all I hear at home is when are Democrats going to get tough?"" Connolly said. ""We are looking weak."" So far,  as many as 137 House Democrats have publicly stated  their support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, according a CNN count -- more than half the caucus and with dozens having joined in the past two months. But that number is still far below a majority of House members and Pelosi has long warned of the political consequences of taking such a step against the Presidents.  Speaking to CNN's Poppy Harlow on ""Newsroom"" Monday, Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas said if Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in exchange for a reopening of an investigation into Biden's son, he would support an impeachment inquiry. ""I don't think we have a choice under the Constitution. We must move forward with impeachment proceedings. I don't think we'll have much of a choice,"" Gonzalez said.  New subpoena threat The new comments from Democratic lawmakers Monday comes as three House committees threatened to subpoena the State Department over ""documents the State Department has been withholding in response to a letter the Chairmen sent two weeks ago relating to efforts by the President and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to solicit the help of a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 Presidential Election."" Three chairmen -- House intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel and Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings -- authored a letter Monday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. ""Seeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution, which the President is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend,"" the three chairmen wrote jointly. ""Yet the President and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election."" Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he discussed the former vice president in a July call with Ukraine's president. CNN has previously reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, which hasn't been shared with lawmakers despite calls from Democrats. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  This story has been updated with additional developments Monday."
"This article is part of Paul Krugman’s newsletter. You can  sign up here  to receive it each weekday. Only 11 days have passed since Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee,  revealed  that the Trump administration was illegally withholding a whistle-blower complaint from Congress. When the news came out, I — probably like most observers — expected it to be another fizzle, yet another clear example of Trump malfeasance that would just fail to catch fire with Congress or the public. And that may yet happen. I presume and hope that pollsters are at work as we speak, trying to gauge public opinion on the scandal. But this time feels different, maybe because it’s so simple and clear cut. The president of the United States and his personal lawyer both admit that they called on a foreign regime to produce dirt on one of his political rivals. It now looks as if he tried to pressure said foreign regime by  withholding crucial military aid , which makes it worse. The result is that this scandal is blowing up in a way previous Trump scandals, no matter how serious, haven’t. A House vote to impeach has quickly gone from “unlikely” to “more likely than not” now that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to announce a formal impeachment inquiry. Why does this matter? In general, I dislike the common journalistic trope of “winners and losers” from political developments. In this case, however, it seems to me like a good way to sum up the fallout so far. So here are three winners and two losers from the developments so far. Winners 1. Adam Schiff: After years when it seemed as if nothing could shake Trump’s ability to stonewall, Schiff started an avalanche that has a good chance of bringing the wall tumbling down. 2. The narrative of Trump as betrayer of America: There has been abundant evidence all along that Trump’s team colluded with Russia in 2016, and that Trump in office has been all too happy to carry water for brutal foreign autocrats. But it was all complicated and obscure enough to confuse many people. Pressuring Ukraine to smear Joe Biden’s son is something everyone can understand, and it retroactively makes all the other accusations credible. 3. Hard-working reporters: We don’t have all the facts about what exactly Trump and company did to set off the whistle-blower, but the past week and a half have been one devastating revelation after another, all thanks to reporters at major news outlets, including The Times. Losers 1. “Savvy” journalistic analysis: The two great media sins of 2016 were false equivalence and the substitution of speculation about how things would “play” for description of what was actually going on. Sure enough, the first reaction of some in the media was to present Trump’s verified abuse of power and completely unsupported claims of corruption by Joe Biden as comparably grave, and to suggest that the episode somehow “raises questions” about Biden — a cowardly dodge of the media’s obligation to get at the truth. But articles along these lines generated huge criticism, and I’m seeing a lot less of that sort of thing in the past couple of days. 2. Senate Republicans: It’s looking quite likely now that G.O.P. senators will have to vote on charges of impeachment — charges that will be based on documented abuses, not disputable interpretations. Most if not all of them will, of course, vote to acquit. But in so doing they’ll expose their corruption and disloyalty to American principles for all to see. So it’s been quite a couple of weeks. And while it won’t be over until November of next year, and probably not even then, it looks as if Trump and his party are finally in the kind of trouble they deserve. Quick Hits The Founding Fathers worried a lot about foreign influence on U.S. politics; sometimes it seems as if Trump took their concerns as an  operating manual . It’s important to realize that Ukraine is engaged in a slow-motion war with Trump’s  favorite dictator . Diplomacy depends on the use of both sticks and carrots. Trump gets the sticks part, but the carrots part doesn’t work because nobody trusts him to  honor his promises . You can almost feel sorry for Republicans, who know that any criticism of Trump will  tank them with the base . On the other hand, never mind; they chose to put themselves in that position.

"Sen. Elizabeth Warren overtakes Democratic presidential rivals Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders in latest New Hampshire poll; reaction from Robin Biro, former Obama campaign regional field director. As  Sen. Bernie Sanders  sinks to a distant third in a number of new national and early voting state polls, top members of his presidential campaign are taking aim at  Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  -- the other progressive superstar in the Democratic nomination race who’s soared ahead of Sanders in the surveys. The swipes signal what could be a newly aggressive phase for the Vermont senator's campaign, with a hitherto ""truce"" between him and Warren beginning to crack as his polling numbers suffer. One progressive strategist with ties to the i ndependent senator’s  campaign said that when it comes to negating Warren’s surge in the polls, the Sanders team has been “flailing around.” WARREN SURGES IN LATEST POLLS, TIES BIDEN FOR TOP SPOT; SANDERS SLIPS TO DISTANT THIRD Sanders and Warren met last December before they launched their presidential bids and agreed to not criticize each other while on the campaign trail. That non-aggression-style pact has largely held – with both teaming up at recent presidential debates to defend their ""Medicare-for-all"" proposals. And both had refrained  from attacking each other. “Bernie and I have been friends for many, many years. Long before I ever got into politics. And I don’t see any reason that that should change,” Warren told reporters recently after being asked if she was going to start painting contrasts with Sanders. Sanders – who’s making his second straight White House run – has repeatedly said when asked about Warren that “Elizabeth is a friend of mine” and noting that the two “have been friends for over 20 years.”  But that’s apparently not stopping some leading members of Sanders' team from taking aim at Warren. The Sanders campaign’s national press secretary Briahna Joy Gray recently criticized Warren on Twitter for failing to support Sanders’ national rent control proposal. Warren has said she doesn’t think such a policy would be realistic across the country. Gray used Warren’s viral zinger from the July debate in targeting the senator from Massachusetts. Gray also jabbed at Warren over her campaign's lack of a collective bargaining agreement with her staff since recognizing her campaign workers’ union in June. Sanders also faced a bit of criticism as he met the demands from his own unionized campaign staff. In another case, senior Sanders adviser Warren Gunnels took aim at Warren’s climate change plan. As Vox noted, Gunnels retweeted a tweet from a New York City councilman saying that Warren had “missed the mark.” As they were battling for second place in the polls most of the summer, the Sanders campaign repeatedly insisted that former Vice President Joe Biden was the main target. The former vice president was the clear front-runner in nearly all polling from his entry into the race in late April until recent days, when a slew of new surveys suggested that Warren had tied Biden for the top spot. WARREN LANDS BACKING OF PROGRESSIVE GROUP THAT ENDORSED SANDERS IN HIS 2016 PRESIDENTIAL BID While Sanders kept his focus on Biden, Warren surged in polling and, in a well-publicized moment, she landed the endorsement of the progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid. Meanwhile, Sanders in recent weeks has replaced a couple of key staffers in Iowa and New Hampshire, the states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar.  “They thought their opponent was Biden because they thought he was the next Hillary Clinton,” noted the progressive strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely. The strategist argued that the Sanders campaign failed to realize that Warren was the real threat, spotlighting that “their strategy was wrong. They were looking at Biden as the main opponent when it was really Warren.” "
"Sen. Cory Booker's staff has been put on notice that he has until the end of September 2019 to raise $2 million or he will be dropping out of the race; former DNC Chair Donna Brazile reacts. Sen. Cory Booker’s  presidential campaign manager is warning in a memo to staff that the  Democratic senator from New Jersey  must raise an additional $1.7 million by the end of the third quarter of fundraising – just 10 days away – or the campaign will not have a “legitimate long-term path forward.” In the memo , campaign manager Addisu Demissie warned that following a weaker than expected cash haul during the early part of September, “the next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race."" BOOKER VOICES CONCERNS OVER BIDEN'S ABILITY 'TO CARRY THE BALL' The existence of the memo was first reported Saturday morning by NBC News, with Fox News confirming the news with multiple sources. Two sources, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said it was no accident that the memo was leaked, and described it as an effort to spark a surge in fundraising over the next 10 days.  And a campaign memo sent to political reporters Saturday morning said: “This isn't an end-of-quarter stunt or another one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press. This is a real, unvarnished look under the hood of our operation at a level of transparency unprecedented in modern presidential campaigns.” Booker, who declared his candidacy for the White House in early February, quickly built a formidable operation in the early voting primary and caucus states. The large staff on the ground in Iowa, New Hampshire, and other early voting states is expensive to maintain. Demissie warned that while the campaign can continue at its current size and strength,  it needs more funding if it wants to expand. WHERE BOOKER STANDS IN THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2020 POLL Demissie explained in his memo ""If our campaign is not in a financial position to grow, he’s not going to continue to consume resources and attention that can be used to focus on beating Donald Trump, which needs to be everyone's first priority.” While Booker qualified for the third and fourth round Democratic presidential primary debates, he’s struggled in polling, averaging in the low to mid-single digits,  far behind top-tier contenders former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

"Van Ness, a cast member of the reality makeover show who  recently publicly shared he is HIV positive ,  tweeted Wednesday,  ""The moment I knew I was endorsing @ewarren was last month when I misplaced my HIV meds."" ""It cost $3500 to replace them out of pocket with 'amazing' plantinum (sic) level insurance,"" he wrote. ""Healthcare shouldn't be for profit ever, it's a human right.""  Shortly after his announcement, Van Ness posted to Twitter  a video of Warren calling him  to thank him for the endorsement. ""I'm glad we're going to be in this fight together, side by side,"" the Massachusetts senator is heard saying on speakerphone.  ""Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights,"" Warren said. Van Ness said he wanted to work with Warren to de-stigmatize the idea of universal health care, and asked Warren to tell him how he could best be of service.  Warren, who has been  steadily rising in the polls , backs eliminating private insurance and has endorsed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' ""Medicare for All"" single-payer legislation. The bill would create a national government-run health care program and essentially eliminate the private insurance industry. Warren  has not released a health care plan of her own , and has instead thrown her support behind Medicare for All. The Massachusetts Democrat co-sponsored legislation in the Senate aimed at lowering the price of prescription drugs, which includes allowing the federal government to manufacture generic medications if their prices spike. Van Ness this week published a memoir, ""Over the Top: A Raw Journey to Self-Love,"" where he writes about being sexually assaulted as a child, battling drug addiction and being diagnosed with HIV. He recently discussed living with HIV with  The New York Times .  In April, members of the cast of ""Queer Eye""  went to Capitol Hill to drum up support for the proposed Equality Act , which would prohibit discrimination based on gender identity, sex and sexual orientation by expanding the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

"Trump addresses reporters as he arrives at the United Nations, says 'what Biden did was wrong.' It was in the national interest of the United States that Ukraine, under siege by our Russian nemesis, be given the full quantum of military aid extended by Congress. It was in the political interest of  President Trump  that Ukraine aggressively investigate credible allegations of corruption and conflict-of-interest against former Vice President Joe Biden, a favorite among the Democratic candidates seeking to run against Trump in 2020. The national interests of the United States and the political interests of the president are not the same thing. If President Trump conflated them in his discussions with  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , that was a failure of judgment. But have we lost our capacity to say conduct is censurable without turning it into something it is not – such as effective immunity for  Biden  and grounds for Trump’s impeachment? GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN Don’t get me wrong. It is not my purpose to minimize the politicization of American foreign relations. To the contrary, I just wrote a book, "" Ball of Collusion: The Plot to Rig an Election and Destroy a Presidency. "" In many ways, it is a ""cri de coeur"" for a restoration of a vital American norm. Incumbent administrations must not wield the awesome powers of the presidency, especially the powers to conduct foreign affairs and gather foreign intelligence, out of sheer partisanship. My purpose is to place the potential wrong in context. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Let’s say, for argument’s sake, it is proven that Trump used his enormous influence over Kiev, or worse, his control over the release of defense aid Ukraine needs, strictly to better his electoral chances against Biden. That would be an abuse of power. It would also make the 45th president, well, the 45th president in American history to exercise his powers under the influence of his political standing. That is particularly true of presidents seeking reelection, even if we suspect that most exploitations of foreign relations power for electoral advantage have been less crude than Trump’s alleged squeezing of Ukraine. On that score, we must note that Trump denies exerting pressure and Ukraine denies that it felt pressured. Moreover, reports indicate that while the president urged his counterpart, repeatedly, to look into Biden’s alleged corruption, Trump did not explicitly tie that request to a release of $250 million in U.S. defense aid – although that aid, previously approved by Congress, was being slow-walked for reasons the administration has yet to explain. Still, even if we assume that the president delayed the aid in order to spur Kiev regarding Biden, that hardly means Biden’s conduct and patent conflict-of-interest do not rate scrutiny. In one of his notorious speak-first-think-later flourishes, Biden openly bragged that, as President Obama’s vice president, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in financial aid Kiev desperately needed as a quid pro quo to extort Ukraine’s government into firing a prosecutor. As the invaluable investigative journalist Peter Schweizer  outlined  in a Fox News column, this prosecutor was investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company that had put Biden’s son, Hunter, on its board under circumstances strongly suggesting it was currying favor with the then-vice president. Hunter Biden was lavishly compensated, notwithstanding that he had no discernible expertise in the energy sector. Ukraine, moreover, is no one-off. Rudy Giuliani, the president’s private lawyer (who hired me as a prosecutor more years ago than either of us would care to remember), has pointed out that Hunter Biden accompanied Biden on Air Force Two for a trip to China about U.S. government business that apparently turned into an eye-popping $1.5 billion windfall for the then-vice president’s son. That is, Biden proved quite accommodating as the Obama administration’s point-man on relations with Beijing, and Beijing quickly made an astonishing injection of capital into an investment firm started by Hunter Biden and Chris Heinz (the stepson of then-Secretary of State John Kerry). As Schweizer details in his important book, ""Secret Empires,"" the Communist Chinese government became a partner in the venture, as did a Massachusetts-based consultancy firm headed by James Bulger – son of the powerful former Massachusetts state senator Billy Bulger, and nephew and namesake of the notorious mobster Whitey Bulger. That Trump may have been ham-handed in raising Biden allegations in the context of U.S.-Ukrainian relations does not mean Biden should get a pass. Indeed, if these activities involved a son of Donald Trump rather than Joe Biden, The New York Times and The Washington Post would already have assigned the usual five or 10 alpha-journalists apiece, and we’d already have been treated to the usual breathless hourly updates on CNN and MSNBC. Obviously, a president can be in the wrong without being impeachable. Impeachment is a political remedy. It is a nonstarter in the absence of broad, bipartisan public support, which is plainly lacking in Trump’s case. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Political wrongs, if they are established, must be measured against the conduct of past presidents. Extensive investigations are underway of the Obama administration’s exploitation of foreign relations and foreign intelligence powers to influence the 2016 election – favoring Hillary Clinton and targeting Trump. Presumably, these investigations are inquiring into the relationship between the Obama administration and Ukraine. That relationship involved not only dropping an investigation of Hunter Biden’s company, but revving up an investigation of Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman. (At least, he was until media leaks sourced to Ukrainian officials resulted in his ouster.) If Trump abused his powers, he was wrong to do so. It will make his reelection bid more difficult. But let’s not pretend he would the first to play this unsavory game. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY"
"We've experienced the peaceful transfer of power for 230 years, including the constitutionally messy outcomes in 1876, 1888, 2000 and, well, 2016 for that matter. No tanks rolled through the streets and no shadow governments operated from underground bunkers even when the guy with the most votes didn't end up in the White House.  So why in 2019 do so many Americans -- across party lines --  believe  that if their candidate loses next year it can only be because the election was rigged?  Here's one place we can look: For the third time in his presidency, Donald Trump has an 86-point gap between what Republicans and Democrats think about him, according to the  latest Gallup approval poll . Ninety-one percent of Republicans approve of his job performance to date, while only 5% of Democrats feel the same.   This ties the highest gap  Gallup has ever measured in a single survey. President Obama had an 86-point gap two days before his reelection in 2012. President Bush hit the low 80s twice in the run up to his reelection. Reagan only made it into the 70s -- also in the fall of 1984. In all 3 cases, the partisan divide peaked during the days and weeks before a highly contested election.  We are still 14 months away from Election Day. But Americans on both sides appear primed and ready to vote.  Just four years ago , only 32% of voters said they were ""extremely interested"" in the 2016 election. But this week, that same poll shows 59% are extremely interested this time around. And if you only include self-identified partisans, the number jumps into the 60s.  And with stakes this high, Democratic voters appear to be grappling with their own dilemma: vote for a candidate who best exemplifies their visceral loathing for Donald Trump or vote for the candidate who is most likely to beat him?  Current polling shows the race for the Democratic nomination  is tightening  between Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren. But that doesn't mean voters are picking between them.  The polls are pretty clear that Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters  would prefer  to vote for Elizabeth Warren.  They think  she's won every debate so far. And as the 20,000 people who showed up to her New York City rally this week can attest, she leads Biden in voter  enthusiasm  by double digits.  But  nearly half  of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters believe that Biden is best positioned to beat Trump. Barely 1 in 10 think that of Warren.  If history is any indication, there's every reason to suspect the partisan divide heading into 2020 will get worse. After all, that 86% gap just means we have 14% more to go.   All of this is a big problem for Elizabeth Warren.   As David Leonhardt noted in the  New York Times  this week, Warren has struggled to win blue collar workers (you remember: the ones that gave Trump his narrow wins in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania?) in her own state of Massachusetts since 2012. She underperformed even her fellow down ballot Democrats in the last election. Voters on both sides of the aisle in these swing states are tuned in and eager to vote, but Biden out performs her in a head to head with Donald Trump in Wisconsin  by 9 points , for instance.  Of course, Joe Biden has his own lurking shadows.  Unlike Elizabeth Warren, who has developed her following based on her progressive appeal and solid debate performances, Biden's standing with the Democratic electorate seems largely driven by fear—fear of losing again to Donald Trump. If she can assuage that fear—or if another candidate can prove more viable—Joe Biden could be looking at a swift and total collapse. We've got a long way to go in this race, but the growing partisan divide around Donald Trump and the fear of losing to him in 2020 means electability will only grow in importance to Democratic primary voters. And that's bad news right now for every candidate whose name doesn't rhyme with Schmiden.   Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the 2020 election is 16 months away. "
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks to reporters following Speaker Pelosi's announcement on a formal impeachment inquiry. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ,D-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday that actions President Trump has already acknowledged render him eminently impeachable. “What is going on is that the president has committed several impeachable offenses. He, himself, what he has admitted to is already impeachable, regardless of future developments,” said Ocasio-Cortez. She referenced such things as emoluments and pushing for assistance from foreign governments. Ocasio-Cortez, an outspoken freshman lawmaker and Democratic socalist, has long pressured her party to pursue impeachment PELOSI ANNOUNCES A FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP This came as House Democrats officially launched a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday afternoon, fueled by a whistleblower’s accusation that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his potential 202O opponent, Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter. The whistleblower alleged that Trump had ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before his phone call with Zelensky. The whistleblower said Trump told Zelensky that he would not release the aid unless he investigated Biden. A source familiar with the situation  has told  Fox News the whistleblower did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the phone call and Trump has agreed to release a transcript on Wednesday. Trump has denied any wrongdoing on the call. GOP REP. INTRODUCES RESOLUTION TO REMOVE NADLER AS JUDICIARY PANEL CHAIRMAN OVER IMPEACHMENT PROBE In a subsequent  tweet , Trump said, ""The Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it, including legislation on gun safety, lowering of prescription drug prices, infrastructure, etc. So bad for our Country!""

Rosario Dawson  penned an op-ed in which she said the current U.S. immigration policies feed into “a larger white nationalist narrative.” The 40-year-old actress, who is dating  2020 presidential  hopeful Sen.  Cory Booker , shared her thoughts in an article for The Daily Beast in which she pulled no punches speaking about the  Trump administration's  rhetoric on immigration, directly linking it to the  Aug. 3 shooting in Texas . “The story that the current administration repeats ad nauseam is about a “violent invasion” of immigrant hordes — the exact same words used by the gunman who targeted our Latino community and shot down 22 innocent people in El Paso last month,”  she wrote . “This last week’s denial of refugees from the Bahamas fleeing the destruction of Hurricane Dorian because they could be “very bad gang members” saw thousands of climate refugees abandoned to squalid conditions.” ROSARIO DAWSON POSTS TOPLESS VIDEO TO MARK 40TH BIRTHDAY The star highlighted the importance of telling positive stories about immigrants in the U.S. as well as the consequences of misrepresenting them.

They operate as part of a larger white nationalist narrative, a continuation of manifest destiny-thinking remixed for the age of Twitter,” she wrote. WHY ROSARIO DAWSON REPORTEDLY DIDN'T ATTEND BOYFRIEND CORY BOOKER'S DEBATE NIGHT Dawson continued: “The truth is, this thinking is symptomatic of an old and still very much alive colonial disease. If we want to heal this country’s deep scars on these issues, we need to look at the root causes and treat them at the source. When it comes to immigration, this is more than just a political crisis—we’re suffering a crisis of our very humanity. And one way to change the debate in Washington is by changing the stories we produce and consume in our own lives.” Dawson pointed to a new web series that she helped make and co-stars in titled “The North Pole” as an example of something telling worthwhile stories about immigrants. The series is set in Oakland, Calif., and follows four young people as they deal with issues such as immigration struggles, wildfires, racial tensions and much more. The actress, who fans may know from roles in films like “Rent,” “Men in Black II” and “He’s Got Game,” is also known for her political activism. She backed  Sen.

"The mainstream media is failing to hold  Joe Biden  accountable for discrepancies regarding his explanations about his son's business dealings in  Ukraine , White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Monday on  ""Fox & Friends"" . ""He’s not telling the truth and the fact checkers are asleep because it’s Joe Biden and they’re asleep to not even check their own facts, their own reporting when he admitted that he talked to his father. There are allegations that he was piggybacking on some of the trips when his father was vice president,"" she said. Conway argued that Joe Biden's claim to Fox News'  Peter Doocy  that he did not speak to his son Hunter about his ties to natural gas firm Burisma Holdings is disputed by Hunter's own comments in a New Yorker  article . SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL Conway accused the media of providing favorable treatment to Biden as his presidential campaign has sunk from ""electable to incomprehensible."" ""The media sees another Hillary Clinton in the making and they’re trying to figure out a way to prop him up,"" Conway argued, pointing out a recent poll which showed Biden trailing ""angry socialist"" Elizabeth Warren in Iowa. ""So they’re worried. They’re running scared,"" she said. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE' The Trump administration pushed back  Tuesday in the wake of multiple reports that the White House froze millions in aid to Ukraine shortly before President Trump pressured the country's leader to  investigate  Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The reports coincided with a renewed round of calls, including from more centrist Democrats, for a formal impeachment inquiry. Those calls came a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she is opening the door to that route if the administration continues to withhold a whistleblower complaint apparently related to  Trump's Ukraine  discussions. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats have called for the transcript of the phone call to be released. Conway said Trump hopes the contents of the call are made public, but noted the potential ramifications for foreign policy. ""You don’t want to have a chilling effect on other leaders wanting to speak with the president. But you saw him yesterday. He said, 'I hope you will learn what’s in there. It was a perfect call,'"" she responded. Fox News' John Roberts and Brooke Singman contributed to this report."
"New reaction from  Fox Nation  host  Tammy Bruce  after former Massachusetts Gov. and  2020 Republican primary  contender  Bill Weld  suggested that  President Trump  should be killed for committing treason. ""In a normal world this would be shocking and it would not come from someone Americans take seriously, but it highlights how seriously broken opponents of the President have become.  It is also a reflection of the nature of the rhetoric that the establishment has propagated ever since they felt threatened by the Trump presidency,"" Bruce told Fox News. BRUCE: TRUMP HATERS CONSUMED WITH RAGE, SPEW UNHINGED RHETORIC On Monday, Weld appeared on MSNBC to weigh in on the escalating controversy over the President's phone call to the President of Ukraine.  Scrutiny of the call was sparked by reports of a whistleblower's complaint that the President suggested a quid pro quo with a foreign leader, and now additional reports that the White House froze some aid to Ukraine shortly before Trump asked Ukraine's president to  investigate  Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Administration sources told Fox News that the reason for the aid freeze was tied to concerns about corruption. “Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election, it couldn’t be clearer. And that’s not just undermining democratic institutions, that is treason. It’s treason pure and simple. And the penalty for treason under the U.S. Code is death. That’s the only penalty,"" said  Weld  on MSNBC sitting alongside fellow GOP primary challengers Joe Walsh and Mark Sanford. In a recent  opinion piece  on FoxNews.com and in the latest episode of  ""Get Tammy Bruce""  on Fox Nation, Bruce examined the apparent rise of violent rhetoric among critics of the President.  Just weeks later after writing that piece, she found it glaring relevant again, though she said that was not a surprise. ""When I wrote  this opinion piece  I knew that we were on this trajectory.  It turned out to be – unfortunately – what we call ‘evergreen commentary’ because it would still be relevant weeks, months and even years later.  This is now the trajectory of the Left and critics of the President... unleashing even more unhinged rhetoric to demonstrate to the baying leftist mobs how much they hate him,"" explained Bruce. In her  column  and on Fox Nation, Bruce also argued that the level of vitriol directed at the President is rooted in the establishment's distaste for the voters that propelled Trump to the White House. ""The public chattering class of Democrats and  Republicans  who remain apoplectic about Trump’s success and their own pathetic failures hate Trump because they hate the average American who put him in office. The president is the proxy for the American voter and every person who dared to fire the establishment in 2016, and it’s those people who must be dealt with,"" wrote Bruce. Additionally, the examples of this dangerous rhetoric are numerous and growing, according to Bruce, and she believes the media plays a role in stoking it. ""We’ve heard comments that suggest violence, recently from Jennifer Rubin, as an example, who is touted as the ""conservative"" columnist at the Washington Post. She said in an interview that it is not enough to defeat Trump but that they need to ‘burn down’ the Republican Party so that there could be no 'survivors,'"" she continued, ""Joe Walsh, a Republican who's running for president and who has made clear he hates the president, says he is not running against the President’s policies, but to punch him in the face every day."" ""Relying on violent rhetoric is now a trend and it is almost as if they have to one-up each other in order for the media to keep giving people like them airtime.  It’s as though they feel the next thing they say has to be more dangerous or violent or extreme in order to prove that you are with the people that hate the president.  It’s a mob mentality and it feeds on itself."" Bruce concluded with this, ""These people who imagine themselves the intelligentsia, the moral arbiters of our society, the decent ones, they assure us, must be given the reins of power to protect us from the bad man in the White House. As they call for the physical assault, arrest and even execution of the president of the United States. They say they're protecting us from the bad, bad, man when in fact all they have to do is look in the mirror to find the worst among us.

"""I can't detail what it involves. Period,"" Quigley told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room."" ""I will tell people that it is deeply disturbing. It reinforces the concerns that what we previously learned and I think it is a blueprint for what we still need to know."" Quigley asserted the whistleblower complaint ""is the political equivalent"" of  Trump's claim during his 2016 presidential campaign  that he could ""stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody"" without losing voters. ""What the President said during the campaign, he said he could shoot someone on the street and his base would stay with him. I guess what I read, to me, was the political equivalent of that: defying the constitution, committing a criminal act and thinking, 'Well I can get away with it,' "" he said. ""Some sort of bizarre cult of personality. Deeply disturbing what we read this morning. Alarming."" The whistleblower complaint -- which was hand-delivered to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for lawmakers to review -- deals, at least in part, with a phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25.  A transcript of the conversation released by the White House  shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Even before the whistleblower complaint was made available to lawmakers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday  declared  Trump had betrayed his oath of office and announced she was opening a formal impeachment inquiry intot he President. Trump has downplayed the significance of the complaint, claiming the whistleblower is partisan and his conversations with foreign leaders have been ""appropriate."" Quigley said Wednesday that he thinks the whistleblower complaint would ""have an impact"" on public support for impeachment if it were made public.  ""I do think it will have an impact on the Americans who haven't already made up their mind,"" he said. ""We're counting on them to lead this country forward."" Speaking to CNN later Wednesday, California Rep. Eric Swalwell echoed Quigley's characterization of the whistleblower complaint, adding that it outlines ""further evidence to seek, other witnesses to find, and documents as well as witnesses who would corroborate what he or she is complaining is an urgent and credible concern, which I also found to be an urgent and credible concern."" While most lawmakers  declined to comment  on the complaint Wednesday, some Republicans did push back on the way Democrats were framing the document. Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah told CNN after viewing the complaint ""there's nothing in there that changes the way I felt"" earlier in the day when he had expressed support for Trump's accounting of events.  Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas said the best evidence he saw was the transcript of Trump's call with the Ukrainian President ""as opposed to an accounting of the conversation from someone who wasn't there."" ""It provided information beyond the transcript,"" he said of the complaint, but wouldn't weigh in on whether that information is detrimental or beneficial to Trump. And after viewing the document Wednesday, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York  tweeted  that she does not support impeachment and that the complaint ""should be immediately declassified and made public for the American people to read."" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff announced Tuesday that the whistleblower who filed the complaint would like to speak to the committee. ""We have been informed by the whistleblower's counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting (Director of National Intelligence) as to how to do so,"" Schiff tweeted."
"MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' co-host Mika Brzezinski declared that President Trump isn't mentally fit for office and that it's time to invoke the 25th Amendment 'or something else.' MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski  praised the decision by  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , to launch a formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump, tweeting Tuesday that it was a move towards justice that gave her hope. ""I am so moved right now. I am hopeful for the first time in a long time,"" she said, alongside hashtags for Pelosi, ""justice,"" and ""oversight."" Brzezinski's tweet came just as Pelosi announced a  formal impeachment inquiry , saying ""the president must be held accountable"" for his ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections."" Invoking the ""darkest days of the American Revolution,"" Pelosi called on lawmakers to honor their constitutional oath to protect the country ""from all enemies, foreign and domestic."" PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP She also suggested that Trump engaged in an impeachable offense by asking Ukraine to investigate  former Vice President Joe Biden . ""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said during a speech on Tuesday. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella."" Trump blasted the move on Tuesday, tweeting that Democrats never saw a transcript of his phone calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

"""We have a Senate that instead of trying to harness the opportunity and potential of every person in this country, they're trying to pull us back,"" Kennedy said Saturday in announcing his run. ""And I'm running for the United States Senate to tear that down, to fight back with everything we've got."" In recent weeks, Kennedy, 38, has sought to draw a generational contrast with Markey, 73, while benefiting from the goodwill shown for the generations of Kennedys who have represented the state before him.  In a campaign email Saturday, Kennedy lists conversations he's had with constituents following President Donald Trump's election and ""outdated structures and old rules"" as reasons he decided to enter the Senate race.  ""This is the fight of our lives, the fight of my generation — and I'm all in,"" he said.  Kennedy is the heir to a political dynasty that has never lost an election in the state, the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy and the son of former Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy II. One great uncle, Ted Kennedy, served in the Senate for nearly 50 years. Another, John F. Kennedy, won his first congressional race in 1946, when Markey was born. Kennedy drew on his family's long ties to Massachusetts in his announcement Saturday. ""It's extremely meaningful to me to be able to do this here, where in 1848 a few steps from where this building is today, my father's family first arrived here in this country,"" he said. Kennedy told reporters on Thursday that Markey is ""a good man,"" but had other issues he wanted to address in the race. Kennedy volunteered for the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic and worked as an assistant district attorney for Massachusetts before his election to Congress in 2012.  Last year, Kennedy gave the Democratic party's official response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, calling for a ""better deal,"" a ""living wage,"" paid leave, affordable child care, ""solvent"" pensions, ""fair"" trade pacts, good roads and a ""health care system that offers mercy, whether you suffer from cancer or depression or addiction."" He also turned his sights on the President. ""Bullies may land a punch,"" he said. ""They might leave a mark. But they have never, not once, in the history of our United States, managed to match the strength and spirit of a people united in defense of their future."" Some viewers focused less on his message and more on his mouth, wondering about his shiny lips. In 2019, Kennedy gave some advice to this year's speaker, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, tweeting to ""misplace your chapstick."" In the past several weeks, as the congressman's interest in the Senate seat became clear, Markey lined up prominent Democratic endorsements. His backers include fellow Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a presidential candidate, and  over 100 state legislators , including House Speaker Robert DeLeo and Senate President Karen Spilka.  ""I endorsed Ed Markey six months ago, seven months ago. I've cut a video for him. Eddie has been a great partner in the Senate,"" Warren told reporters last month, referencing her February decision. ""I think I know why you're asking that and if it's about Joe Kennedy, I will also say Joe Kennedy is also a great partner. He and Lauren were both my students and I worked with Joe before either one of us was in politics and have worked with him ever since he's been in Congress. He's really an amazing person."" US Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democrats' campaign arm and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the firebrand freshman, also back Markey. ""I'm going to run on all the issues I've been fighting for today and into the future: climate change, income inequality, a woman's right to choose and on gun safety legislation,"" said Markey this week. ""I am going to continue those fights into this campaign and I will do so every day that I'm out there crisscrossing the state of Massachusetts and fighting for the people of our state."" Rep. Lori Trahan, Democrat of Massachusetts, has endorsed Markey and said that Kennedy's entry to the race will not change her mind. She told CNN she supports Markey for his leadership on both local and national issues, including his work  addressing pipeline explosions  in her district and his role sponsoring the Green New Deal. She added that even though she's for Markey, ""I think the world of Joe."" Other Massachusetts Democrats are so far keeping out of the race, including Reps. Seth Moulton and Ayanna Pressley, who won their House seats through taking on sitting congressmen in primary campaigns in 2014 and 2018. Moulton told CNN that both Kennedy and Markey are ""great progressive leaders for the state."" In an interview, Pressley said she looked forward to continue working with Markey on environmental and gun control issues, while working with Kennedy on mental health care.  ""I think primaries are healthy,"" Pressley added. When asked about whether he had tried to flip the endorsements of his fellow members of Congress, Kennedy told reporters on Thursday that he respected the decisions that they've made.  ""The race is going to be decided by the people of Massachusetts,"" Kennedy said."
"His longtime former lawyer Michael Cohen  told  Congress last February that Mr. Trump had never explicitly asked him to lie.   ""He doesn't give you questions, he doesn't give you orders,"" Cohen said. ""He speaks in a code. And I understand the code, because I've been around him for a decade...""    The account of the half-hour conversation that the White House released on Wednesday suggests that the Ukrainian President understood the code as well.  American politicians who raise enormous sums for their campaigns without explicitly promising donors an illegal ""quid pro quo,"" are also fluent in the unspoken language of their trade.         If House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is serious about pursuing an impeachment case against Trump, she will have to employ expert witnesses who can translate Trump's code into plain English. She will have no problem finding them on Capitol Hill.   Prosecutors do this all the time to help jurors understand what's really going on in wiretapped conversations between seasoned and wary gangsters. Any fan of ""The Sopranos"" would know that someone who has been ""clipped, whacked , erased, iced or hit,""  has been murdered.    If Pelosi hopes to prove Trump did anything impeachable on the call, a careful deconstruction of his words will be required, beginning with the  transcript memo  released by the White House. The President's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, quite helpfully provided a definition of the crime of bribery in two fiery encounters on cable news with CNN's Chris Cuomo and Fox's Laura Ingraham earlier this week.  ""The crime of bribery is if I offer something of value to someone in return for their official action,"" he  told  CNN's Chris Cuomo. He  expanded  on this for Fox's Laura Ingraham: ""The crime of bribery is defined in the Ukraine, as well as all of the world, as the following: You cannot offer something of value in exchange for official action.""   Unfortunately for Giuliani, this appears to be exactly what the President did. The White House's ""memorandum"" begins innocently enough, with Trump congratulating the Ukrainian President on his recent electoral victory. Zelensky then fawns over Trump. He notes that he copied Trump campaign themes such as ""draining the swamp"" and compliments Trump as ""... a great teacher for us..."" Trump then reminds Zelensky that: ""Well it's very nice of you to say that. I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are."" Trump then trash-talks German Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying that ""...she talks Ukraine, but she doesn't do anything.""  Next, he bashes other European countries in general (""they should be helping you more than they are""), reminding Zelensky once more ""but the United States has been very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal because things are happening that are not good, but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.""  He follows with the barely coded language: ""we've supported you, unlike Germany and the Europeans.""  And then there is the strange language about reciprocity, about the fact that ""things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine."" Zelensky now sounds worried. He may not be a student of Trump's political road show rallies and is probably having trouble following Trump's meandering stream of consciousness.  Given what Trump has just said in the conversation, Zelensky could well be thinking: What is he talking about? What have we not been cooperative (reciprocal) about? Is Trump considering a permanent cut-off of American aid and support? A nervous Zelensky replies, reaffirming Ukrainian support and cooperation with the US, including support for US sanctions against Russia and even a Ukrainian decision to buy ""more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes."" Sensing weakness, Trump now follows with the ""ask."" He opens rather explicitly: ""I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.""  He then makes a glancing reference to ""CrowdStrike,"" a company involved in the investigation of the hack of the DNC servers in 2016.  And he follows with a request that Zelensky and Ukraine should cooperate with Rudolph Giuliani and the US attorney general, who will be calling him about getting ""to the bottom of"" whether former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump's political rival, interfered in Ukrainian affairs to compel the firing of a prosecutor who was investigating a company that employed Biden's son, Hunter.  ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son,"" Trump says, ""that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.""   (This Biden allegation has been   debunked by independent fact checkers  and to date there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.)  Nonetheless, the perpetuation of such a charge, even if false, could seriously damage Biden in a close Democratic primary race. Trump says ""Biden has been bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. ... It sounds horrible to me.""  All of this certainly looks like it fits Giuliani's own definition of bribery. President Trump appears to be using his official position as President to coerce the Ukrainian President to investigate possibly false corruption claims in an attempt to smear his Democratic political rival. The ""stick"" or threat that can be wielded is a cut-off of US aid unless Trump gains a personal benefit, the destruction of a political rival. This kind of case is difficult, but provable, with a careful and fair congressional investigation developing corroborative evidence.  In addition, it's possible that if the House votes on articles of impeachment arising from the Ukrainian incident, they will be adding a long list of additional charges based on factual findings in Robert Mueller's report suggesting obstruction of justice and abuse of power. The House could also lodge new abuse of power charges relating to the President's continuing and willful refusal to cooperate with lawful congressional investigations and subpoenas. This is not just a battle with President Trump but a constitutional clash between the powers of the legislative and executive branches of the  longest existing democracy in the history of the planet.

"The question facing House Democrats of whether to impeach  President Trump  should not be answered based on poll numbers, Fox News contributor Sol Wisenberg argued Tuesday on  ""America's Newsroom."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was set to meet Tuesday with fellow House Democrats to discuss whether to move forward with an impeachment inquiry in the wake of the  Ukrainian whistleblower controversy . Wisenberg said if Democrats believe Trump has crossed the line, then questions about the potential political fallout must take a backseat. SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL ""They should ignore the polls and do what they think is right. Impeachment is a solemn matter to be deliberated upon and I think they've been looking at the polls too much,"" the former independent counsel said. ""Whether or not there are grounds for impeachment is a different matter. If you believe there are grounds for impeachment, don't look at the polls, don't worry about how it'll affect the election, move forward."" Wisenberg said he would give the same advice to either party and is not advocating that impeachment would be the right course of action in this instance. ""[Impeachment] is not an easy task in the best of circumstances and I don't think they're gonna have an easy road of it, but my God, they should try to do the right thing,"" he said. UKRAINE CONTROVERSY TURNS INTO DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR BIDEN The push for  impeachment  has picked up steam in recent days, including from  Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., in response to a whistleblower complaint that reportedly alleged Trump pressured the  Ukrainian  president to investigate  Joe Biden  and his son, Hunter Biden. ""The House must impeach. It must start today,"" Warren tweeted Tuesday morning. In addition, a slew of key swing-district Democrats  threw their support  en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as  The New York Times ,  The Washington Post  and  The Wall Street Journal  reported Monday that Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Multiple administration sources  confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that the Office of Management and Budget indeed told the State Department and Department of Defense  in July that it was putting a hold on the aid to Ukraine. But administration sources told Fox News that the reason for the freeze was tied to concerns about corruption. The rapid-fire support for an impeachment investigation by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after Pelosi  strongly suggested  she was now warming to the idea."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi delivers remarks following Democratic meeting on moving forward with impeachment proceedings. CNN anchor Jake Tapper  suggested on Tuesday that  President Trump  might alter a transcript of his call in which he reportedly urged Ukraine's president to investigate  former Vice President Joe Biden. ""This is a White House that has falsified information before -- from showing a doctored hurricane map to promoting a video that an outside group altered of a CNN reporter. So who knows if this transcript will actually be complete?"" Tapper asked. He also noted that complaints surrounding Trump involved more than just the phone call. Tapper's comments came just before  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,  announced a formal impeachment inquiry. Pelosi said ""the president must be held accountable"" for his ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections."" PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP ""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said.

I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella. ""The president must be held accountable,"" she continued. ""No one is above the law."" Trump, on Tuesday, denied any wrongdoing and offered to release the transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He also blasted Pelosi's decision to pursue impeachment since she ""never even saw the transcript."" Trump has denied pressuring Zelensky, something Ukraine's foreign minister seemed to  corroborate  on Saturday. The president also disputed speculation that he tried to extort an investigation out of Ukraine by withholding foreign aid.

Mr. Sanders joins fellow senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren in championing the idea as a means of curbing runaway inequality and funding social programs that would benefit the rest of the country. “This proposal does not eliminate billionaires, but it eliminates a lot of the wealth that billionaires have, and I think that’s exactly what we should be doing,” he said. “Democrats Want to Tax the Rich. Here’s How Those Plans Would Work (or Not).” The debate:  Do we need a wealth tax? WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW Proposals for closing the gap between the country’s rich and poor  often revolve around taxing income , but a staggering amount of wealth is increasingly locked up, like fresh water in glaciers, in fortunes that rich people have already accrued or inherited.  The three richest Americans — Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates — now own more wealth than  the bottom half of the country . While net worth nearly tripled for the top 1 percent between 1995 and 2016, it barely budged for the middle class, which is still recovering from the Great Recession, and went negative for the bottom 10 percent, according to  Brookings  and the  Urban Institute . The racial wealth gap has also widened, with the median white family owning  10 times more wealth  than the median black family. If you pay property taxes, you already pay a kind of wealth tax. But in January,  Ms. Warren  proposed a 2 percent tax on net worth from $50 million to $1 billion and a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion, which she says would pay for universal child care, free public college and the cancellation of student loan debt for 75 percent of those who have it.  Mr. Sanders ’s is a more aggressive tax that would halve the typical billionaire’s wealth in 15 years, which he says would help pay for universal health and child care, as well as his  universal housing plan . [The big debates, distilled. This guide will put in context what people are saying about the pressing issues of the week. Sign up for our new newsletter, Debatable.] WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING Capitalism needs a wealth tax  The idea of a wealth tax is not new, but it gained mainstream popularity with the publication in 2013 of the French economist Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” the book that launched a thousand think pieces. Mr. Piketty, who has expressed support for both  Ms. Warren’s and Mr. Sanders’s  campaigns, argued that a capitalist economy inevitably produces wealth inequality that is self-perpetuating and, if left unchecked, “potentially terrifying.” He  wrote : When the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income, as it did in the nineteenth century and seems quite likely to do again in the twenty-first, capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities that radically undermine the meritocratic values on which democratic societies are based. To avert what he calls “patrimonial capitalism,” where rich people get ever richer only by virtue of being rich in the first place, Mr. Piketty prescribed a global wealth tax, progressing from 1 percent on assets of one million euros to 5 to 10 percent on assets above a billion euros (as well as an “optimal” top marginal income tax in developed countries around 80 percent). “Short of that, many may turn against globalization,” he wrote with prescience in  The Financial Times  in 2014. “If, one day, they found a common voice, it would speak the disremembered mantras of nationalism and economic isolation.” A wealth tax may not work Even those sympathetic to the spirit of a wealth tax acknowledge that there are considerable pragmatic obstacles to its implementation. Even if there were sufficient political will to pass it, it could face a constitutional challenge.  Megan McArdle , a libertarian Washington Post columnist,  writes : The big problem is Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, which forbids “direct taxes” on people or property unless they’re “apportioned” — doled out among the states by population. Instituting an income tax required a constitutional amendment to override that clause, and Warren’s plan might well require another.  Both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have cited numerous  legal experts  who say a wealth tax would be constitutional. But with the Supreme Court’s composition being what it is, the question is  far from settled . There’s also the matter of enforcement. As Paul Krugman notes, the wealthy are quite good at  avoiding taxes and evading them illegally . And because many assets owned by the ultra-wealthy — like artwork and diamonds — aren’t always traded on the market, Ms. McArdle writes, taxing them would mean “creating a lot of administrative capacity to track and price the assets, with the wealthy and their lawyers fighting every step of the way.” “If these difficulties prove insurmountable,” writes Noah Smith, a left-leaning economist, in Bloomberg, “Warren and other egalitarian tax crusaders might consider an alternative —  an inheritance tax , which would close many of the loopholes that now riddle the U.S. estate tax.” He adds: Taxing all income from inheritances — including trusts, foundations, gifts, estates, and any other kind of family transfers — at a very high rate would yield a result similar to a small annual wealth tax, only its constitutionality would be less in doubt. And it would focus the tax on the rich people whose fortunes Americans are most likely to think of as being undeserved. A wealth tax is a bad idea Skeptics of the idea of a wealth tax argue that it has a  bumpy track record . While 12 European countries had a wealth tax in 1990, Greg Rosalsky writes in NPR, only three (Norway, Spain and Switzerland) still do. He writes:  According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries — and, perhaps worst of all, it didn’t raise much revenue. An economist and leading inequality scholar who has advised Ms. Warren, Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, says that her wealth tax is designed with those failures in mind, since it applies only to the ultra-wealthy, taxes citizens wherever they live and imposes a 40 percent “exit tax” on Americans worth more than $50 million who renounce their citizenship. Still others oppose the idea on principle, for the very reasons many support it. Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute,  writes  in Bloomberg: Warren’s wealth tax would be an abuse of government power. It is the tax-code equivalent of looting mansions. What is wrong with the way these 75,000 families made their money? Paying taxes is not a punishment, and the tax code should not be used to penalize any group of citizens. Not even the very rich. A wealth tax is only a start A wealth tax could close the country’s wealth gap from the top, and the universal social programs it helps fund could go some way to closing the wealth gap at the bottom. But more targeted redistributive measures, like reparations, may be needed to completely close the gap between blacks and whites, argues William Darity Jr., a professor of public policy at Duke University.  He told The Times :  That’s an objective that is not achieved by any of the existing policies on the table now. Ultimately, you need a person-based program if you’re really concerned about the racial wealth gap. And it not only has to be person-based, but it has to be race-specific. Some on the left have also criticized the idea of a wealth tax as utopian in its belief that those at capitalism’s helm would steer the system in a direction it by nature does not want to go. To fix the problem at the root, writes Benjamin Kunkel in The London Review of Books, imagine  a market socialist revolution  through which the shares of all corporations are transferred into public hands. With ownership of the means of production more evenly distributed, inequality wouldn’t deepen automatically as Mr. Piketty says it does under capitalism. Mr. Kunkel writes: The notion of such a revolution — first in one country, then gatheringly international but not yet universal — is fanciful right now. But is it more so than a global capital tax requiring the coordination of virtually all nations? … Socialist revolution frankly seems more likely. … Capitalism can dispense with democracy more easily than with profits. THE TAKEAWAY In “Capital,” Mr. Piketty himself wrote that his idea of a progressive global wealth tax was indeed “utopian.” Yet he also said that the United States, producing as it does a quarter of global G.D.P., wouldn’t need to “ ask permission ” from other countries to pioneer the policy. Six years later, the ground has shifted — or at least appears to have. “I’m delighted to see people talking about a wealth tax,” Ms. Warren said on Tuesday after Mr. Sanders announced his plan. “We need all of the presidential candidates talking about it. Where are the rest of them?” Two is a coincidence, the saying goes, but three would make a trend.  Do you have a point of view we missed? Email us at  debatable@nytimes.com .

[The New York Times]  WHAT YOU’RE SAYING Here’s what readers had to say about the last debate:  When should a president be impeached ? Jay Orchard of Miami commented: “In 21st century America, the rule on impeachment apparently is that a president should be impeached when voter polls show that voters would support impeachment.” Colleen Gillard   of Massachusetts wrote: “Pelosi’s terrifying Catch-22: She has no choice now but to enforce the Constitution. But if a strong minority of this country disagree, having elected him knowing exactly who he is, impeachment will drive them to the polls.” And another reader commented: “For me, the murder of the English language is a ground for impeachment. I will also settle for treason.”"
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announces formal impeachment inquiry. For almost three years, the leadership of the  Democratic Party  in Congress resisted calls from its politically-inflamed base to  impeach   President Trump . Polls showed little support for  impeachment  among actual voters. They were skeptical of it. Older members in Congress, like  Nancy Pelosi , remembered well what happened the last time the opposition party impeached a sitting president. Republicans did that, you'll remember, back in 1998. And in the end, the only winner in that saga was  Bill Clinton  himself. He was supposedly disgraced. But in fact, if you looked at the numbers, he was politically much stronger than he had been before he was impeached. Pelosi, and not for no reason, told colleagues she worried that impeaching  Donald Trump  might just get him reelected. And so up until just last week, impeachment seemed like a fading prospect. And then suddenly, out of nowhere, it seemed, with little fanfare and almost no explanation, everything seemed to change. WHITE HOUSE TO RELEASE DOCUMENT SHOWING INTEL COMMUNITY WATCHDOG FOUND WHISTLEBLOWER HAD 'POLITICAL BIAS,' OFFICIAL SAYS On Tuesday,  Pelosi announced that impeachment proceedings are in fact underway , full-steam ahead. ""I can say with authority, the Trump administration's actions undermine both our national security and our intelligence,' Pelosi said. ""The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the president's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and betrayal of the integrity of our elections. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry. The president must be held accountable. No one is above the law."" The people who sold out your country to China are concerned that President Trump betrayed America somehow. As of this moment, Pelosi's party seems to agree; they are behind her mostly. As Congressman John Lewis of Georgia explained, working to remove an elected president just a year before a  Democratic election  is in fact, somehow, a defense of democracy, or something like that. ""I believe - I truly believe - the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come,"" he said before Congress. ""To delay or to do otherwise will betray the foundation of our democracy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Are you confused yet? If so, we don't blame you. If you left town for the week, you may be wondering what the hell is going on exactly. Impeachment? For years, they told you that Trump was going to be impeached  for colluding with Russia, spying for Putin . Then it turned out he didn't do that. The story evaporated into dust and seemed to blow away. Then just a few days ago, they were grumbling about impeachment again, and they dragged in Corey Lewandowski. Remember him?  They brought him to Capitol Hill to make their case . That didn't go well at all. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., House Judiciary Committee chairman: And so we ask you, is it correct that as reported in the Mueller report on June 19th, 2017, you met alone in the Oval Office with the president? Corey Lewandowski, former Trump campaign manager: Did you read the exact language of the report? I don’t have it available to me. Nadler: I don't think I need to do that. I have limited time. Did you meet alone with the President on that date? Lewandowski: Congressman, I'd like you to refresh my memory by providing a copy of the report so I can follow along. Nadler: You don't have a copy with you? Lewandowski I don't have a copy of the report, congressman. Nadler You don't have any independent recollection of whether you met with the President on that date. Lewandowski: Congressman, I'm just trying to find in the Mueller report where it states that. Nadler: Well, you have it in front of you. I gave you the page number. Lewandowski: We are on Page 90, is it, sir? Unidentified male: Mr. Chairman, you've got to the clock. Nadler: No, I don't have to start the clock. He is filibustering. It didn't take much for Chairman Nadler to collapse live on C- SPAN -- pretty embarrassing. You'd think at some point, Democrats might just decide to run a real presidential campaign in 2020 and beat Donald Trump that way, just like in a democracy. It would have to be more effective than what they're doing now, and the numbers show it. As of this morning, Donald Trump's approval rating was the highest it has been since the inauguration. But no, Democrat don't want to wait until the next election. They don't want to wait until November. Politics takes too long, and it leaves too much to chance. The risk of democracy is voters might not agree with you. Hillary Clinton learned that the hard way in 2016. And the one thing Democrats don't want to do is to repeat that. Better to remove your opponents by force, if you can. Which brings us to the latest question of impeachment: What exactly is this about? Nobody has bothered to explain why sending $400 million in military aid to Ukraine is in the interest of the United States. They haven't even thought to explain that. They're too busy yelling about impeachment. Sorry to laugh in the middle of this -- we've spent all day trying to figure out what is the impeachment story. It's about Ukraine. It's less than a week old. And so you might be forgiven for not understanding why would the president be impeached for a story that the Democrats  literally can't explain ? What did the president do wrong? We're going to do our best to tell you the case that they're making. And honestly, as we said, it's confusing and not all that interesting. Within a sentence, here is what they're saying. They're saying that in a phone call with the president of Ukraine, President  Trump threatened to delay a $400 million military aid package to Ukraine, unless the Ukrainian government agreed to investigate possible criminal activity involving Joe Biden's son. Why Joe Biden's son? Well for five years, Joe Biden's son, Hunter, it turns out, was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.  Why would Joe Biden's son be on the board of a Ukrainian gas company ? He had no experience in the energy business. He didn't speak the relevant language. He apparently had no experience whatsoever in the region. It turns out at that very moment, Joe Biden was President Obama's point man for Ukraine. Oh. So at a certain point during this saga, the gas company in question was investigated. And then in 2016, the Ukrainian prosecutor overseeing that investigation was fired. Apparently, he was fired under pressure from then-Vice President Joe Biden. Now to the layman, that looks a lot like corruption. What does it have to do with the president being impeached? Well, the accusation is that President Trump suggested that that squelched investigation deserved a second look. And Democrats say that suggestion was an impeachable offense. Are you following this? Of course, there are plenty of other reasons that the U.S. might not want to send $400 million to Ukraine. It's a notoriously corrupt country, for one thing. What do we get out of it, is another. And by the way, sending military aid to Ukraine may please the neocons in CNN -- Bill Kristol was strongly for it -- but it also greatly increases the chances of conflict with Russia. And of course, that would mean nuclear conflict potentially. What's the point of that, exactly? Nobody has bothered to explain why sending $400 million in military aid to Ukraine is in the interest of the United States. They haven't even thought to explain that. They're too busy yelling about impeachment. And they're doing it with all the hysterical intensity that has become the hallmark of the modern left. They have a lot of energy. Too bad, none of it is focused on the country's real problems, and there are a lot of them. We don't want to go through the same litany again, but we will hit on just a couple because they're worth mentioning. Our national debt is exploding. And that includes credit card debt, by the way. Personal debt at its highest ever measured. We have a war in Afghanistan that we can't seem to win or end. Our towns outside the big cities are being decimated and desiccated by opioids and suicide. If you haven't been there, drive through and take a look for yourself.  We have basically an open border with Mexico. Tech companies trying to control our freedom of speech. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In many ways, our country is on the wrong track, and people know it. Everybody knows it, Democrats and Republicans. But instead of trying to fix any of that, Democrats want to spend the next year explaining -- and they plan to -- why it was perfectly fair for Joe Biden's ne'er-do-well son to get 600 grand a year from Ukrainian oligarchs. That's totally fine. But it's somehow criminal for Donald Trump to ask about that. That's the message. Good luck with that. Hard to imagine many voters will be impressed by it.

"Mark Levin, the talk radio host who has been one of President Trump’s most ardent defenders, tried to offer his listeners some reassurance this week as they processed the dizzying developments in Washington. “There’s a lot of disinformation and misinformation,” he warned. “I’m here to help us walk through this and defend this nation against a tyranny in our midst.” Rush Limbaugh cast himself in a similar light — part fact checker, part coach rallying the team at halftime. “You’re going to know everything you need to know about this latest faux scandal,” he promised, adding, “Everything you’re seeing is deception.” Even Michael Savage, a conservative host who has been critical of the president at times, joined in circling the wagons. “There is a war going on right now,” he told his audience this week, adding, “They haven’t given up trying to destroy us.”  With the president facing an impeachment inquiry, and a whistle-blower report made public Thursday that raised new questions about whether he tried to cover up his efforts to enlist Ukraine’s help in discrediting a political rival, allies of the White House in the pro-Trump media wasted no time constructing their own version of events.  Their narrative omits key facts, like Mr. Trump’s  entreaty  to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky: “I would like you to do us a favor.” It portrays the president’s political opponents and the mainstream media as contemptible and corrupt persecutors, blinded by hatred and their failure to bring him down so far. “Russia, Russia, Russia. Racism, racism. And recession. And now it’s going to be Ukraine,” Jeanine Pirro, a friend and fierce defender of Mr. Trump said on the Fox Business channel. [ Sign up for our politics newsletter  and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Their words echo those of the president himself, who once declared, “What you are seeing and what you are reading is not what’s happening,” and  beseeched  his followers to “stick with us,” and not to believe what “you see from these people, the fake news.” The potential political benefit is significant. Mr. Limbaugh, Mr. Levin and Sean Hannity have a combined weekly radio  audience  of nearly 42 million listeners. Combined with the programming on Fox News and stories from Trump-friendly outlets like Rasmussen Reports, which publishes a  daily tracking poll  of the president’s approval ratings that is typically several percentage points higher than other surveys, the conservative media is wrapping Mr. Trump and his supporters in a security blanket of their own facts, data points and story lines about the Ukraine controversy. “It’s victory at the expense of truth,” said Michael Harrison, the publisher of Talkers Magazine, which tracks the talk radio industry. The desire to win the argument and the election, he added, has resulted in media where “you don’t hear debate anymore; it’s just preaching to the choir.” In the world of conservative media, Mr. Trump is a popular, unbeatable figure. In reality, his numbers in the Gallup presidential  approval poll  have never climbed above 46 percent (he is the first president never to reach 50 percent in their survey, which dates back to Harry Truman). His campaign’s internal numbers have shown him  losing badly  to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden in key battleground states. Mr. Trump has dismissed the numbers as “fake polls.” A common defense from the right has been to flip the criticism and accuse  liberals  of fabricating their own reality. Mr. Levin, who has a Sunday evening Fox News show in addition to his daily radio show, said this week that Democrats and the mainstream media had created an “unreality” that was designed to “humiliate the president, to try and dispirit you, and to drag down his poll numbers and defeat him.” The president’s media defenders often characterize the investigations and media coverage not merely as political attacks on Mr. Trump but as a culture war against people who support him. Mr. Savage was one of Mr. Trump’s first talk radio boosters during his 2016 campaign. But he had been publicly  doubting the president  and criticizing him for failing to keep promises like building a wall on the southern border. The issue of impeachment has helped reignite Mr. Savage’s passions.  “It’s not about Trump is it?” he said on his show. “It’s about us. It’s about our love for America. It’s about our love for our own borders, language and culture.” Richard Nixon played to similar “us versus them” grievances during the Watergate investigations and also blamed the media, which he  said  “hate my guts with a passion.” That approach helped keep a sizable chunk of Americans behind him even when he resigned. Roughly a quarter of Americans said at the time that Nixon’s conduct was not serious enough to warrant resignation,  polls showed. Nixon, of course, had nothing like the pro-Trump media to defend him. Talk radio in its current format, with its heavy tilt toward conservative provocateurs, did not develop until the 1990s. In Nixon’s day, cable news was still a few years away and the most popular hosts on the radio talked about subjects like extraterrestrial activity. Mr. Trump’s allies repeatedly invoke the special counsel investigation into his campaign’s dealings with Russia during the 2016 election, which failed to produce the smoking gun-type revelations that many on the left had predicted. The president’s critics, they say, are once again engaging in a smear campaign to declare him guilty before all the evidence is out. As Mr. Savage said on Wednesday, “He is already in the hay wagon on the way to the guillotine because of the fascist vermin in the media.” [ On the campaign trail with Mark Sanford, the former South Carolina governor who wants to unseat President Trump .] They also appear to have learned an important lesson about how Mr. Trump and his attorney general, William P. Barr, managed the narrative of the release of the special counsel report: They are moving fast to tell the story on their terms. And that is a story in which Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden — not Mr. Trump — have covered up wrongdoing involving their Ukrainian interests. Mr. Hannity, whose radio show each day begins with an announcer declaring that he is “Fighting the Trump-hating liberal media one day at a time,” called the Biden angle “the real story.”  Mr. Limbaugh told listeners, “Joe Biden may be the most corrupt politician in Washington bar none.” Then he offered a novel theory of the origins of the Ukraine-Trump investigations. “This effort going on here is actually a twofer,’’ he said. “It is designed by the Democrats to take out both Trump and Biden and clear the way for anybody else, probably Elizabeth Warren.”  Mr. Trump has also characterized the investigations as a Democratic conspiracy to weaken his standing, which he said is formidable. “Democrats feel they’re going to lose,” he said on Wednesday, pointing to Rasmussen numbers that had his approval rating at 53 percent, which he insisted was too low. “They say you could add ten to it. A lot of people say you can add more than ten to it,” Mr. Trump said. On Fox Business this week, Ms. Pirro made a similar point. Democrats, she said, were going to “shoot themselves in the foot and he’s going to win in 2020, and that’s the end of that chapter.”  Lou Dobbs, another friend of the president’s and Fox host, smiled and agreed. “That’s a pretty good chapter for America if he does indeed. And he will.”"
"Let's go through it, step by step. 1. Trump, after congratulating Zelensky on his win, very quickly establishes that the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.  ""I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are."" 2. He then makes clear that the US does a lot more for Ukraine than Ukraine does for the US.  ""I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine."" 3. Trump directly asks Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.  ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me."" 4. He suggests that Zelensky should talk to his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr. ""I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it."" 5. And then Trump reiterates that suggestion ""I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call."" So, in sum: The President of the United States tells a foreign leader that we do a lot for his country and his country hasn't done enough for us. Then he says that it would be super nice if Ukraine looked into allegations --  debunked by all independent fact checkers and there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, it's worth noting  -- that his main rival in the 2020 race did some unethical things in the country. Because, he asserts, it sounds ""horrible"" to him. And then reiterates -- several times! -- that the Ukrainian president needs to talk to his personal lawyer and his administration's attorney general about all of this. Are you kidding me? And reminder, this isn't even really a transcript of their call. As the document notes: ""The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation."" Even if Trump hadn't openly asked Zelensky to look into Biden and instead only suggested that he had heard rumors of corruption regarding the Bidens and Ukraine, this call would be problematic. Because the United States is a global superpower which was, at that moment, withholding loan money from Ukraine -- a fact that the newly elected president of said country would be intimately aware of. That Trump just came out and asked for Zelensky to investigate the Bidens -- after reminding him several times of how much the US did for Ukraine!!!! -- is something very close to the textbook definition of a quid pro quo. Take it out of the context of politics. Let's say you are a small business owner who has seen an uptick in business thanks to a series of referrals coming to you via a much larger company. And the CEO of that much larger company calls you and says something lik e ""We are doing a lot of good for your bottom line, right? More than you are doing for us. So, hey, our biggest competitor is apparently doing some pretty nasty things with their workers. You should really look into that.""   Now the larger company CEO didn't come out and say, ""Hey, do this muckraking of our main competitor or else your pipeline gets cut off by us,"" right? But unless your brain stem has somehow disconnected from your brain, you know exactly what is being asked here. Do this, or else. It's hard to imagine why Trump, knowing what he said, would have spent the past 48 hours defending the call as ""perfect"" and totally above board. The actual transcript makes that pre-spin laughable. ""It ended up being a nothing call,"" Trump said in the wake of the release of the transcript on Wednesday morning. But what is documented, very clearly, in this kind-of, sort-of transcript is this: The American President pressuring a foreign leader to look into the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. And doing it by reminding the Ukrainian President of all the US has done for his country. The transcript is truly stunning stuff -- even from a President who has moved the goalposts on ""stunning"" a long time ago. If Trump thought releasing this transcript would somehow make Democrats look like fools for beginning an impeachment inquiry against him, he was wrong. Very, very wrong."
"Less than half an hour after Pelosi finished her announcement, Trump tweeted a  video  featuring footage of several Democratic presidential candidates and notable House Democrats expressing support for impeachment proceedings.  ""Democrats have one sole focus,"" the video reads, followed by footage of 2020 hopefuls Kamala Harris, Tom Steyer and Elizabeth Warren, along with Pelosi and House Reps. Ilhan Omar, Al Green, Cedric Richmond, Rashida Tlaib, Ted Lieu, Adam Schiff, Maxine Waters and Jim Clyburn backing impeachment.     The video then cuts to rally footage of Trump dismissing calls for his impeachment, arguing that ""it's working the other way, because now we have our best poll numbers that we've ever had."" ""While Democrats (sic) 'sole focus' is fighting Trump, President Trump is fighting for you,"" the video concludes. The video was not a last minute project -- Trump's campaign prepared the impeachment montage video weeks ago, an official told CNN.  ""We were ready in case the Democrats were that dumb,"" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told CNN. ""And they were."" Trump began firing back at Democrats minutes after Pelosi's press conference with a slew of attacks on Twitter. He started with  accusations  that after his productive day at the United Nations summit, ""Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage."" ""Pelosi, Nadler, Schiff and, of course, Maxine Waters! Can you believe this?"" he  said .  Trump  pointed  to the fact that Democrats ""never even saw the transcript of the call"" he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. Trump faces outrage over reports that he  pressured Zelensky to investigate  Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son, Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. He  asserted  that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo received permission to release the transcript from the Ukrainian government, and ""they don't know either what the big deal is."" ""A total Witch Hunt Scam by the Democrats!"" Trump tweeted, one of his frequently used phrases hearkening back to the Mueller investigation, as well as  bemoaning : ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham later slammed House Democrats, accusing them of having ""destroyed any chances of legislative progress for the people of this country by continuing to focus all their energy on partisan political attacks.""   ""Their attacks on the President and his agenda are not only partisan and pathetic, they are in dereliction of their Constitutional duty,"" she added. In a Republican response following Pelosi's announcement, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that ""she does not speak for America when it comes to this issue."" McCarthy slammed Democrats' continued investigation of Trump -- arguing their job was ""not to continue to investigate something in the back when you cannot find any reason to impeach this President"" -- and accused Pelosi of being hung up on the results of the 2016 election. ""She cannot change the laws of this Congress. She cannot unilaterally decide we're in an impeachment inquiry,"" McCarthy said. ""What she said today made no difference of what's been going on.

"Sanders, a Vermont independent, has come under fire from a number of his 2020 Democratic presidential primary rivals over the cost of his plans, which would run into the trillions of dollars. While he has maintained that the wealthy would foot the bill for most of those proposals, Sanders has acknowledged that the middle class would see their taxes rise to pay for Medicare for All. He says that many Americans would still come out ahead because they would no longer pay premiums or out-of-pocket bills for health care. The new proposal was rolled out a day after  Bloomberg  reported that a polling firm associated with former Vice President Joe Biden had been studying which arguments against Medicare for All would be most effective with voters. One of its conclusions: the cost to taxpayers. Sanders responded to the news by insisting again that ""no one earning less than $29,000 will pay any new taxes"" under his plan, which he called ""a great deal for the American people."" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has already  unveiled plans to push for a similar wealth tax , which she often cites on the campaign trail -- to roaring approval from supporters -- as the potential source of funding for a series of ambitious programs. Sanders could be angling to establish a similar pitch, and respond to Biden, with a populist win-win proposal that pays for expensive new programs by soaking the rich. Under Sanders' ""tax on extreme wealth,"" married couples worth more than $32 million would pay a 1% tax on their wealth above that threshold. The rate would rise to 2% on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, climbing in increments to a 8% tax on wealth above $10 billion. The tax would be levied on single filers worth more than $16 million, with the top 8% rate assessed on their wealth above $5 billion. Sanders has long railed against the growth in income inequality in the US, noting that over the last 30 years, the top 1% has seen a $21 trillion increase in its net worth, while the bottom half has lost $900 billion in wealth.  ""We are going to take on the billionaire class, substantially reduce wealth inequality in America and stop our democracy from turning into a corrupt oligarchy,"" said Sanders, who earlier this year released a proposal that would expand the federal estate tax on the wealthiest 0.2% of Americans, imposing a top rate of 77% on estates worth more than $1 billion. His wealth tax, meanwhile, would hit the richest 180,000 households in US who are in the top 0.1%, according to the proposal. It would cut the wealth of billionaires in half over 15 years. The levy would raise $4.35 trillion over a decade, according to University of California Berkeley economics professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who analyzed the plan for the Sanders campaign. It would eliminate the gap in wealth growth between billionaires and the middle class. The professors, who are well known for their work on income inequality and taxing the rich, also evaluated  Warren's wealth tax proposal , which she released in January. Warren is calling for a 2% levy on wealth above $50 million, with an additional 1% tax on net worth above $1 billion. Saez and Zucman estimated her plan would raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years from about 75,000 households. Sanders would use the revenue raised from his tax to pay for his universal childcare proposal and his affordable housing plan, which calls for capping annual rent increases and investing in affordable housing.  His housing plan  is estimated to cost $2.5 trillion over a decade. It would also help fund Medicare for All, which independent experts have estimated could cost around $32 trillion over 10 years. Taxing wealth, however, could be very difficult to do. There are questions about whether it is permitted by the US Constitution, with legal scholars falling on both sides of the argument. Also, wealth taxes can be tough to administer since the rich often have assets that are hard to value. Sanders maintains a wealth tax is constitutional, and his proposal includes several enforcement mechanisms."
"Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is surging and has a real ground game in Iowa, says Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier, anchor of 'Special Report.' MANCHESTER, NH –  A new poll in the state that holds the  first presidential primary  in the race for the White House indicates  Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  has surged and now enjoys a slight 2-point advantage over  former Vice President Joe Biden,  the longtime front-runner in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The Monmouth University survey,  released Tuesday, also shows  Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont  fading to a distant third.  WARREN EDGES OUT BIDEN IN NEW IOWA POLL, SANDERS DISTANT THIRD Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in the state ,  with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within the survey’s sampling error.  Warren’s support has soared by 19 points from the previous Monmouth poll in the Granite State, which was conducted in May. Biden’s dropped 11 points from that survey. Sanders, meanwhile, is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent, dropping 6 points from Monmouth’s May survey.  New Hampshire, which votes second in the presidential nominating calendar following the Iowa caucuses, is considered by many political analysts and pundits as a must-win for both Sanders and Warren. The independent senator from Vermont crushed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, launching the one-time longshot for the nomination into a marathon battle against the eventual nominee. He’s retained a strong organization and devoted supporters in the state as he bids a second time for the White House. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  But Warren, who like Sanders hails from a neighboring state to New Hampshire, has also built up a powerful campaign organization in the Granite State, and has made numerous visits. Warren will return to the state to hold town halls on Wednesday and Friday. “Warren continues to look stronger with every new poll. She seems to be picking up support across the spectrum with gains coming at the expense of both Biden and Sanders,” said Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray. The surge from Warren is coming from self-described liberals, among whom she’s up 28 points since the May poll to stand at 39 percent, with Sanders dropping 13 points down to 16 percent. Warren’s also risen 11 points among self-described moderate and conservative voters to stand at 18 percent, with Biden dropping 15 points to stand at 30 percent. According to the poll, the only other candidate to register in double digits is South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who’s at 10 percent, slightly behind Sanders. Sen. Kamala Harris of California stands at 3 percent in the survey, with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each at 2 percent. The remaining 10 candidates tested in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls earned 1 percent or less in the poll. The Monmouth poll in New Hampshire is one of the qualifying surveys the Democratic National Committee uses for their polling thresholds for candidates to make the cut for the primary debates. Gabbard’s 2 percent showing in the new poll means she’s reached 2 percent in four qualifying polls, allowing her to make the stage at next month’s fourth round of nomination debates. The poll’s findings are similar to those of the latest poll in Iowa this past weekend.  A Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom  survey indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling. A new poll released Tuesday in Nevada, which holds it's caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren. A USA Today/Suffolk University survey  puts Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent. The most recent polls in New Hampshire have been all over the board, with one suggesting Sanders holding a lead; another indicating a three-way tie among Biden, Warren and Sanders; and a third pointing to Sanders trailing Biden and Warren. The Monmouth University poll was conducted from Sept. 17-21, among 401 New Hampshire voters likely to vote in next February’s Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. The poll’s release comes with four-and-a-half months to go until the New Hampshire primary.  “It is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux,” Murray noted. "
"Senate Minority Leader Schumer says it is the Senate's duty to take the 'national security matter seriously'; chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge reports from Washington. The escalating controversy over  President Trump’s  phone conversation with  Ukraine’s president  has ignited a battle on Capitol Hill over Democrats’ demands for a copy of the whistleblower complaint against Trump, as some liberal lawmakers threatened subpoenas while Republicans called for restraint while they gather facts. Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate dealings involving 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, citing those claims to revive calls for impeachment. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, but Democrats have been moving full steam ahead, calling for the whistleblower complaint to be released to lawmakers. SOURCE SAYS WHISTLEBLOWER DIDN'T HAVE ‘FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE’ OF TRUMP CALL WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT “The Senate Republican ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ attitude is unacceptable and must change,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Senate floor Monday. “This again is an issue of solemn obligation. There is no wiggle room here, none.” The New York Democrat earlier in the day wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asking him to issue a subpoena and hold hearings over the complaint. In a floor speech Monday afternoon, the Kentucky Republican rebuffed those calls from Democrats, saying the Senate Intelligence Committee has been following an established process and was working to hear from the intelligence community's inspector general this week. “It is regrettable that House Intelligence Committee Chairman [Adam] Schiff and Sen. Schumer have chosen to politicize the issue,” McConnell said, calling for looking into the matter in an “appropriate, deliberate bipartisan manner.” In a statement Monday, Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley called for lawmakers not to rush to judgment. “One thing we do know is that rampant speculation by politicians and the media is not helpful,” he said. “That’s how the false Russia collusion narrative took root.” He added: “Let’s not repeat the mistakes of the past. Going forward, it’s important to respect the law and the whistleblower’s confidentiality while we gather the facts of the case. And of course, transparency is always the best policy so long as we don’t endanger national security.” On Wednesday, Democrats chairing three House committees sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking the department to produce documents related to the complaint, or face subpoenas. “Seeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution, which the President is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend,” the chairmen wrote. “Yet the President and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election.” The letter was sent by Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel of New York and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland. At least one Republican lawmaker, however, has called for the release of the transcript. “At this stage, given the seriousness of the allegations, it’s very important that the transcript and potentially as well the whistleblower come forward,"" said Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, an occasional Trump critic. Meanwhile,  a source told Fox News  on Monday that the whistleblower who sparked the complaint did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the conversation. The source said that it was made clear  in the complaint itself that the whistleblower  did not have direct knowledge of the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky. Fox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials would be on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower was not one of those people. It's unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation or learned of it another way. These new details have fed into skepticism about the allegations from Trump’s allies in Congress, with some likening it to how Democrats  rushed to call for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s impeachment  last week. Some Democrats backed off after The New York Times amended an explosive article on new college-era allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh to make clear that the alleged victim did not have any recollection of the alleged episode. On Fox News’  “Outnumbered Overtime,”  GOP Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah on Monday likened the two situations and called for restraint regarding the whistleblower complaint. “I think it’s fair to just take a breath, and say let's just find out the facts and see what happens,” he said. Without full knowledge of the facts, Democratic calls to impeach President Trump over the whistleblower complaint have no credibility, says Utah Congressman Chris Stewart, Republican member of House Intelligence Committee. Republicans also have been trying to return the focus to Biden. Trump allies have claimed son Hunter improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioned whether his father, the onetime vice president, helped protect him by seeking the ouster of prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was looking into the company's owner. Trump, in a Sunday night tweet, said the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin. Burisma hired Hunter Biden in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted amid protests and as his father was involved heavily in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Two years later, Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless Shokin was fired. Many critics in Ukraine and the West had accused Shokin of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner. Fox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But, the controversy flew largely under the radar until last week. While the heat has been on Trump over whether he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context. Fox News’ Chad Pergram, Jason Donner, Jake Gibson, Ronn Blitzer and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Vice President Mike Pence sits down for an exclusive interview on 'Hannity.' Editor’s Note: The following is an excerpt from Andrew C. McCarthy’s new bestselling book, "" Ball of Collusion: The Plot to Rig and Election and Destroy a Presidency ."" The footnotes have been omitted. It is in connection with Paul Manafort that we encounter some genuine collusion targeting the 2016 campaign: willful collaboration among foreign governments, the  Obama administration , and the Clinton campaign. Just a week after the campaign introduced Carter Page as a  Trump  foreign policy adviser, it announced that Manafort had been brought on board, too. The consultant was an old political hand, experienced managing the rough-and-tumble of a convention fight. Manafort had longstanding, lucrative political consulting (and other business) arrangements with Ukrainian and Russian  oligarchs  who had Kremlin ties. These arrangements had already been spun into a narrative of political corruption in 2007 and 2008 by Glenn Simpson — then a Wall Street Journal scribe. In 2016, as the Fusion GPS impresario, Simpson would pull these articles off the shelf to help weave the Russia-gate tale. FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AS CAUCUS PLANS TO DISCUSS UKRAINE WHiSTLEBLOWER MATTER In February 2014, the Ukrainian Euromaidan uprising finally forced the flight to Moscow of Manafort’s client, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. With American attention intensifying as tensions boiled over in Kiev, Manafort reentered the FBI’s investigative cross-hairs, as did other American political consultants who did work that benefitted the Party of Regions. Yanukovych’s abdication delighted the Obama administration, which was quick to back the new administration of President Petro Poroshenko. Kiev became so dependent on Washington for desperately needed financial support that, by threatening to withhold funds, Vice President Joe Biden pressured Poroshenko into firing Viktor Shokin, one of his top prosecutors. Shokin just happened to be investigating a natural gas company called Burisma, which just happened to have placed Hunter Biden, the vice president’s son, on its board of directors. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER While the Veep pushed the International Monetary Fund to grant Ukraine a $17.5 billion loan package, Burisma lavishly compensated Hunter’s law firm, to the tune of more than $3 million over an eighteen-month span. A lot of money? Sure, but it’s chump change compared to the Chinese government’s $1.5 billion infusion in a joint investment fund with Hunter Biden while Vice President Biden, administration point-man on China issue, turned a blind eye to Beijing’s aggression in the South China Sea. Under the circumstances, it may seem ironic that the Obama administration prodded Ukraine to establish a National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) — but the IMF, like most progressive institutions, is duly impressed by such Orwellian titles. Naturally, the fledgling NABU developed a close-knit relationship with the FBI. In 2014, NABU alerted the bureau to a ledger said to have belonged to Yanukovych, bête noire of the new Ukrainian government. The ledger purports to show $12.7 million in cash payments to Manafort. The FBI used the information to interview Manafort, but the authenticity of the ledger has not been established. Manafort dismisses it as fake, contending that the Party of Regions paid him by wire transfer, not cash. Ukrainian officials have conceded that they cannot prove the payments reflected in the ledger were made. The case was thus reportedly closed with no charges. (Perhaps not coincidental to the Obama Justice Department’s decision not to pursue the case: Manafort had brought influential Democrats into his Ukrainian work, such as former Obama White House Counsel Greg Craig and the consulting firm started by Obama and Clinton adviser John Podesta — a firm that is still run by Podesta’s brother.) But then came 2016, and sudden renewed interest in the Manafort- Ukraine investigation … just as the U.S. presidential campaign kicked into high gear. Contrary to the media-Democrat collusion narrative, Manafort had pleaded with Yanukovych to chart Ukraine’s course toward the EU rather than Russia. It was the Ukrainian president’s rejection of this advice that sparked the protests and his flight to Moscow. Afterwards, Manafort busied himself by propping up a new Ukrainian political organization, the Opposition Bloc, to supplant the Party of Regions. That put Manafort on the radar screen of Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian-American and a DNC consultant who was all in for Hillary. Chalupa is said to have had an inkling that Manafort would become involved in the Trump campaign. Why she did is an interesting and thus far unanswered question. To be sure, if it was conjecture, it would have been sensible conjecture: a Ukrainian keeping tabs on Manafort would know he was a friend and former political consulting business partner of Roger Stone, who was himself vigorously supporting Trump’s bid. Manafort was itching to get back into the American political arena, and Trump’s steamrolling campaign would be a logical landing place. Chalupa also had good sources in Kiev who were focused on Manafort. These included Serhiy Leshchenko, a Ukrainian legislator opposed to Yanukovych’s Party of Regions and the Opposition Bloc, and Artem Sytnyk, NABU’s director. It was Sytnyk who took over and quietly closed the investigation of Burisma after Vice President Biden got Poroshenko to pink-slip the prosecutor. Leshchenko just happens to be a vassal of Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian billionaire who just happens to give millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. Wonder of wonders, Leshchenko took a public, strident anti-Trump position during the U.S. campaign — highly unusual for a foreign parliamentarian. “A Trump presidency would change the pro-Ukrainian agenda in American foreign policy,” he told the Financial Times, so it was “important to show not only the corruption aspect” of the mogul, but also that Trump was “a pro-Russian candidate who can break the geopo- litical balance in the world.” That, he added, was why most Ukrainian politicians were “on Hillary Clinton’s side.” (I’m sure she was thrilled about the enthusiasm in Kiev, but enthusiasm in Wisconsin might have been more helpful.) During the same early 2016 weeks when Chalupa was tapping her Ukrainian sources and giving Democrats a heads-up about a potential Manafort-Trump alliance, NABU investigators and Ukrainian prosecutors journeyed to Washington. There, the Obama administration arranged for them to huddle with the FBI, the Justice Department, the State Department, and the White House’s National Security Council (agencies that coordinated frequently throughout the collusion caper). Andrii Telizhenko, a political officer at Ukraine’s embassy in Washington, later told The Hill’s John Solomon that the U.S. officials uniformly stressed “how important it was that all of our anti-corruption efforts be united.” The officials also indicated to their Ukrainian counterparts that they were keen to revive the investigation of payments by Yanukovych’s ousted Party of Regions government to an American political consultant — i.e., the FBI’s Paul Manafort probe. I know this may be hard to believe, but the Obama officials seem to have been less interested in Greg Craig than in Manafort. Nazar Kholodnitskiy, Ukraine’s chief anti-corruption prosecutor, told Solomon that soon after the January 2016 Washington meetings, he found that Ukrainian officials were effectively meddling in the American presidential election. Another top Ukrainian lawman, Kostiantyn Kulyk, recalled that after the Kiev contingent’s return home from the United States, there was lots of buzz about helping the Americans with the Party of Regions investigation. Which brings us back to Serhiy Leshchenko, Ukraine’s unabashed Clinton backer. And whaddya know — besides serving the government in Kiev and providing scintillating geopolitical analysis, Leshchenko had a side job: he was a source for...wait for it...Fusion GPS — the Clinton campaign-opposition arm, led by Glenn Simpson, which later dreamed up the Steele dossier. Turns out it was Leshchenko (along with NABU chief Sytnyk) who leaked the unverified Yanukovych ledger to the media in May 2016, just after it was announced that Trump had made Manafort his campaign chairman. There is also a pending investigation into whether Leshchenko attempted to blackmail Manafort by sending text messages to the consultant and his daughter, threatening to give NABU, the FBI, and the media “bulletproof” evidence of Manafort’s financial dealings with Yanukovych. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The ledger’s exposure, of course, is what led to Manafort’s ouster as Donald Trump’s campaign chairman. The Ukrainian payments became an important strand of the Russia-gate narrative. The wealth that Manafort’s Ukrainian work generated formed the foundation of his prosecution by Special Counsel Mueller for tax, money laundering, and unregistered foreign-agent offenses. Can anyone say ""Clinton campaign collusion with Ukraine""? The Ukrainian courts can: In December 2018, one such tribunal ruled that Leshchenko and Sytnyk had violated Ukrainian law by leaking the ledger. The infraction, the court added, “led to interference in the electoral processes of the United States in 2016 and harmed the interests of Ukraine as a state.

"Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is surging and has a real ground game in Iowa, says Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier, anchor of 'Special Report.' As she surges in the latest national and early voting state polls, Democratic presidential candidate  Sen. Elizabeth Warren  is making a major television and digital ad buy to spread her message to potential primary voters. Warren’s presidential campaign announced on Tuesday that the populist  Democratic senator from Massachusetts , who’s released one progressive policy proposal after another through the primary campaign, will spend eight figures – or at least $10 million – to place spots on TV and on-line in  Iowa ,  New Hampshire ,  Nevada , and  South Carolina. Those are  the first four states to vote on the primary and caucus calendar. WARREN SURGING IN NEW 2020 POLLS IN NH, NEVADA, IOWA  “Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,” Warren campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in an email to supporters.  Lau explained that  spots “will be more digital than old-school broadcast television, and we have built an in-house staff to produce videos and ads rather than adopt the consultant-driven approach of other campaigns (and the big commissions and fees that come along with it).” The Warren campaign confirmed to Fox News that the digital ads would start running immediately, and that they’re currently reserving time for the TV commercials. Officials said the buy would last for several months. The Warren campaign released three of the ads on Tuesday – 15-second, 30-second and one-minute spots. “Take any of our big problems – health care, climate change, gun violence. Corruption is at the root of why our government won’t act,” Warren says  in the 15-second ad.  “I know what’s wrong. I know how to fix it. And I’ll fight to get it done.” SANDERS UPS THE ANTE WITH WEALTH TAX HIGHER THAN WARREN'S PLAN Lau also announced the campaign is continuing to expand its staffing. While Warren already has a formidable team in the four early-voting states, Lau spoke of  "" hiring state directors and organizers in a number of states that have primaries and caucuses in March. And we're targeting our resources to invest in places that will be critical to keeping the House, taking back the U.S. Senate and regaining ground in key state legislatures in 2020.” The $10 million ad buy and the expansion of campaign staff suggest that Warren’s fundraising remains strong. After a slow start earlier in the year, the senator hauled in over $19 million in the April-June second quarter of fundraising. "
"Former special prosecutor Ken Starr said it is a mistake for Democrats to lead America down ""impeachment road,"" on ""The Brian Kilmeade Show"" Thursday.&nbsp; Fox News contributor  Ken Starr  called  Democratic  impeachment efforts against  President Trump  a ""terrible mistake for our country"" on "" The Brian Kilmeade Show "" Thursday and said it erodes the power and prerogative of the Oval Office. ""This is not something that is to be dismissed, but it's also not something [where] we jump to conclusions and start marching down impeachment road. That is a terrible mistake for our country,"" he said. Starr, who served as independent counsel on an investigation that was used as the basis for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998, accused Democrats of moving too quickly and said there would have to be hard proof of some ""treason"" or ""bribery"" to make any future charges stick. ""To so prematurely jump onto this road and start racing down impeachment road or impeachment alley is, I believe, at this stage, a great disservice to the country,"" he continued. ""Impeachment is about treason. There's no treason here. It's about bribery. There's nothing that, to me, partakes of bribery."" Democrats accused Trump of attempting to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for the government's cooperation in investigating  2020 presidential  hopeful  Joe Biden  and his son Hunter, who had ties to one of the country's natural gas firms involved in a corruption probe. IMPEACHMENT PUSH WILL UNIFY GOP AND PUSH TRUMP OVER THE TOP IN 2020, SAYS SARAH SANDERS The  whistleblower complaint  said Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from a foreign country in the 2020 election -- and that White House officials tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call. Starr claimed it was within the scope of Trump's authority to ask for a favor and said affairs of state and foreign relations are one of the chief functions of the office of the president. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The president is asking for a favor... when we go back to the transcript itself... I don't think it was wise of the president to do it,"" he said. ""Look where we are as a country by virtue of that. You give the other side all of this fodder. So I wish the president hadn't done what he did. But it's an exercise in judgment and it's an exercise in his authority as the president of the United States to conduct the foreign relations of the United States."" ""The foreign relations of the United States are, above all, entrusted to the person who we elect,"" Starr continued. ""This is a terrible interference, what is unfolding. It's a terrible interference with what the president does at the most sensitive level -- which is a person-to-person conversation with another leader.

"DES MOINES — Allegations that President Trump courted foreign interference from Ukraine to hurt his leading Democratic rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr., dominated presidential politics on Saturday, as Mr. Biden demanded a House investigation of Mr. Trump’s phone call   with Ukraine’s leader and as Mr. Trump lashed out, denying wrongdoing without releasing a transcript of the call. With Mr. Trump seizing on a familiar defense, saying Democrats were undertaking a “witch hunt” against him, Mr. Biden called on the House of Representatives to begin a new investigation of whether the president sought the interference of a foreign government to bolster his re-election campaign. “This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power,” Mr. Biden said during a campaign swing in Iowa. “We have never seen anything like this from any president.” Mr. Trump is said to have urged the Ukrainian president on a July 25 phone call to investigate Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who did business in Ukraine while his father was vice president. Mr. Trump’s request is part of a secret whistle-blower complaint in the intelligence community that is said to involve Mr. Trump making an unspecified commitment to a foreign leader, according to two people familiar with the complaint. The sharp accusations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden elevated the president’s dealings with Ukraine as a potentially significant new issue in the presidential race, and offered voters a preview of what is likely to be an extraordinary general election contest  if Mr. Biden were to win the nomination.  The controversy has focused on whether Mr. Trump manipulated foreign policy — a military aid package to Ukraine had been delayed at the time of the phone call — to pressure the country’s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to take action to damage Mr. Biden’s election bid. On Saturday, Mr. Trump sought to deflect attention from that question by accusing Mr. Biden of acting improperly as vice president in calling for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had overseen an inquiry into corruption related to the oligarch whose company employed Hunter Biden.  Mr. Trump  described his conversation with Mr. Zelensky as  “perfectly fine and routine. ” “Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He said that any effort to investigate him would fail, comparing it to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into his ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign. Intensifying a line of attack he and his allies have stoked for months, Mr. Trump said the real problem was Mr. Biden and questions about what the president described as “the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son.”  Referring to his conversation with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump said: “Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster.” No evidence  has surfaced to support Mr. Trump’s claim that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor general’s dismissal. But some State Department officials had expressed concern that Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine could complicate his father’s diplomacy there. The issue strikes a particular nerve for Mr. Biden, who has long feared putting his family under the harsh spotlight of a presidential campaign. During a two-minute encounter with reporters on Saturday morning, he grew irate, angrily insisting that he had never spoken with his son about any overseas work. “You should be looking at Trump,” Mr. Biden said. “Trump is doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum.” Even as they avoided mentioning Mr. Biden, other Democratic presidential candidates moved quickly to capitalize on the new dynamic in the race. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who rarely mentions Mr. Trump in her stump speech, opened her remarks at a cattle call on Saturday afternoon by excoriating both the president and congressional Democrats. “He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system,” she told a crowd of 1,200 cheering Democratic voters gathered in Des Moines for an afternoon of primary speeches. “It is time to call out this illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings right now.” Ms. Warren,  who first called for Mr. Trump to be impeached in April  after the release of Mr. Mueller’s report, went further on Friday, arguing on Twitter that by failing to act on impeachment,  Congress had become  “complicit in Trump’s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in U.S. elections.” Though he has yet to call for impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump — as have several of his rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination — Mr. Biden on Saturday tiptoed closer to embracing the  idea, which  has been gaining support on Capitol Hill despite opposition from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Mr. Biden, whose appearances on the campaign trail can be halting and sprinkled with misstatements, has generally delivered his  strongest performances  when focused on Mr. Trump. Speaking about the president allows Mr. Biden to discuss foreign policy and national security, issues that his campaign has said differentiate Mr. Biden, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, from the rest of the 2020 Democratic field. While  Mr. Trump’s attacks give Mr. Biden the one-on-one showdown with the president that his campaign has spent months trying to create, it also exposes him and his son to another round of questions about Hunter Biden’s business activities in Ukraine.  The Biden campaign moved quickly to warn the news media over the story, underscoring a deep concern about how allegations about the younger Mr. Biden’s work will be received by voters. “Any article, segment analysis and commentary that does not demonstrably state at the outset that there is no factual basis for Trump’s claim, and in fact that they are wholly discredited,  is misleading readers and viewers ,” said the deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, in an email to reporters. But Biden advisers also seized on the furor to portray Mr. Trump as fixated on, and worried about, a potential general election race against Mr. Biden.  “There is only one candidate the president is trying to get foreign governments to dig up bogus dirt on,” Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Mr. Biden, said. The   effort by the president and his team to shift the focus to Mr. Biden could boomerang, casting the Democratic front-runner as a sympathetic figure unfairly attacked with foreign help. It could just as easily mark a defining moment for Mr. Biden, a 76-year-old politician first elected to the Senate in 1972 and long accustomed to playing by the more genteel political rules of a different era. [ Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week? ] Donna Brazile, the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman who led the party through Hillary Clinton’s loss to Mr. Trump three years ago, said the exchange on Saturday “in many ways feels like 2016.” Just the prominent discussion of the actions of Mr. Biden and his son in Ukraine, regardless of the merits of the president’s accusations, has the potential to hurt Mr. Biden, Ms. Brazile said. “We’re basically creating a political  story, which right now is undermining Joe Biden , when I do believe the real focus should be getting the substance of the complaint out to the American people as soon as possible,” she said. On Saturday morning, Mr. Trump posted a video mash-up of TV news footage of stories about Mr. Biden’s son. “This is the real and only story,” the president wrote.  Citing the reports by journalists seemed contradictory given the president’s claim that the media had not reported on the issue. But the tweets signaled that Mr. Trump and his campaign organization would be doing as much as possible to sow doubt about Mr. Biden. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a Biden backer, said that no matter who emerges as the Democratic nominee in 2020, that person will face misinformation and slashing personal attacks by the president and his campaign. “You have any other nominee, Trump will do something comparable to try to disadvantage that nominee,” said Mr. Coons, as he walked with Mr. Biden into a Polk County Democratic Party event. “I don’t see anything about this story that is specific to Joe Biden.” So far, Mr. Biden’s rivals, nearly all of whom converged on Iowa this weekend, have been quick to assail Mr. Trump while avoiding commentary about how the president’s accusations against the Bidens would affect the Democratic nominating contest.  Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey , whose campaign manager on Friday released a memo stating he would have to drop out of the race if he failed to raise $1.7 million before the end of September, remarked that “this is not a partisan issue.” He and  former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas  reiterated their calls for Mr. Trump to be impeached. Even if Mr. Biden’s primary competitors don’t take direct aim, the perception of Mr. Biden’s son leveraging his connections cuts a stark contrast with two leading rivals, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders, who have centered their candidacies around a fierce populist message of rooting out corruption in Washington. It’s a message that worked in 2016 for Mr. Trump, who cast Ms. Clinton as the avatar of establishment self-dealing, a past-her-prime creature of Washington unable to adjust to the times and to produce real change. Mr. Biden’s team is acutely aware of that comparison. After Mr. Biden initially gave only a meager retort on the Ukraine issue Friday, his campaign decided to go further. Sensing an opportunity to highlight Mr. Trump’s fixation with Mr. Biden, his campaign released a statement in his name condemning the president for “abhorrent” conduct and demanding Mr. Trump release the transcript of his call with the Ukrainian leader and allow the director of national intelligence to release the whistle-blower’s claims to Congress. Advisers to Mr. Biden said his  initial reluctance  to comment reflected his prudence about discussing sensitive national security matters rather than unease with the work of his son in Ukraine.  But the former vice president is highly sensitive about questions regarding his family, and it was not until several outlets reported on what Mr. Trump said in the phone call last month that the Biden campaign determined it should try to go on the offensive.

"Ms. Dianna Muller speaks to members of the House Judiciary Committee during a hearing on 'Protecting America from Assault Weapons'. A former police officer made a bold proclamation during a congressional hearing Wednesday regarding a proposed  assault-weapons ban : she would not comply. Dianna Muller, who served in the Tulsa Police Department for 22 years and is the founder of gun advocacy group The DC Project, was among the witnesses at the House Judiciary Committee hearing. The session on an otherwise contentious issue flew largely under the radar amid the Trump-Ukraine controversy and Democrats' impeachment push. But reflecting the gun control divide in the country -- amid a spate of deadly mass shootings that prompted renewed calls for strict laws -- Muller said that such a ban would force lawful gun owners to either give up their arms or become criminals. KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE SUPPORTS A MANDATORY BUYBACK ON 'ASSAULT WEAPONS' ""Please don't legislate the 150 million people just like me into being criminals. It has happened. You've already done it,"" Muller said, referring to the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks, the devices that use a semi-automatic weapon's recoil to make it rapidly fire like an automatic. ""I was a bump stock owner, and I had to make a decision: do I become a felon, or do I comply?"" Should the government pass an assault-weapons ban, Muller declared, ""I will not comply."" Muller and others at the hearing focused on the practicality of a ban, pointing out what they claimed were mainly ""cosmetic"" differences between weapons such as the AR-15 and standard semi-automatic hunting rifles. This issue was also raised by Heritage Foundation senior legal policy analyst Amy Swearer when Rep.Jim  Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., went down the line of witnesses asking if they believed hunting rifles should be banned if they are semi-automatic. Swearer said no, stating that there was no difference in the mechanics or function of an ""assault weapon"" or a semi-automatic hunting rifle. Dayton, Ohio Mayor Nan Whaley, who recalled the recent mass shooting in her city, did not give a definitive answer to Sensenbrenner's question, nor did Dr. Alejandro Rios Tovar, a trauma surgeon who treated victims of the attack in El Paso, Texas. Charlottesville, Va., Chief of Police RaShall Brackney indicated she was in favor of a ban on ""any weapon that could be used to hunt individuals."" Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., countered the idea of a hunting rifle ban by referring to his assault-weapon ban bill. Cicilline said that more than 200 weapons are exempt from the bill, so there is really no issue of eliminating hunting rifles. Swearer also testified against the idea that law-abiding citizens have no need for weapons like AR-15s, recalling how her mother, a gun novice, had difficulty accurately firing a handgun at a shooting range, but was much more effective when she used an AR-15. ""As I read the Second Amendment, it doesn't say the right to bear arms shall not be infringed unless the gun has scary features,"" Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said. 2020 DEMS EMBRACE FEDERAL GUN BUYBACK PROGRAM IN WAKE OF MASS SHOOTINGS Swearer also noted that some features like barrel shrouds enhance the safety of a weapon for its user. But David Chipman, senior policy adviser at the Giffords Law Center, raised a counterpoint noting that a barrel shroud could allow a shooter to get a better grip on a weapon ""in a way that would increase your ability to spray fire and kill more people"" without burning their hand. One feature that was a concern for House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., is the ability for some weapons to be used with high-capacity magazines that allow users to fire dozens of rounds without reloading. Kristen Rand, legislative director of the Violence Policy Center, testified in agreement with Nadler that a ban on such magazines, along with a clear definition of ""assault weapon"" that would eliminate loopholes under the 1994 crime law, would be effective. Congress and the Trump administration have been in talks for weeks regarding possible gun legislation, but discussion of taking away guns that are currently legal has led to criticism from both parties. After 2020 Democratic hopeful Beto O'Rourke declared during a debate, ""Hell yes, we are going to take your AR-15, AK-47,"" Cicilline said, ""That message doesn't help."" President Trump said that O'Rourke was making it ""much harder"" to reach a deal on gun legislation with that sort of rhetoric. Trump's focus when it comes to gun control has mainly been on background checks. The  White House  was also circulating a one-page document on Capitol Hill detailing a possible gun background-check proposal that would require private sellers – not just licensed vendors – to conduct background checks for all advertised sales, though Attorney General Bill Barr said  Trump  has not yet made a “firm decision” on what he ultimately will support. An August  USA Today  poll showed that most American voters support increased background checks, with 85 percent of Republican voters supporting background checks for all gun sales. Presently, only federally licensed vendors are required to conduct background checks, allowing private individuals to sell without them under what has been referred to as the ""gun show loophole."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News last week that he expected an announcement on new gun legislation “very soon.” Gidley said Trump wanted to make sure that any new laws would address actual problems and not just be “feel-good legislation.” But the Democrats' impeachment push could complicate matters. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had resisted impeachment, announced Tuesday that an impeachment inquiry would be launched. Reflecting how policy debates could take a back seat, Pelosi said in private meetings with lawmakers that Trump called her to discuss gun legislation, but she soon changed the subject to his phone call with the Ukrainian president in which they discussed investigating Joe Biden, which stoked the latest calls for impeachment."
"Lessons from the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, Trump's Ukraine call transcript. Laura Ingraham defended  President Trump  Wednesday against  allegations  by Democrats that he was shaking down Ukraine's president to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. ""There is not a single person in Washington with any experience in government, not one, who really believes the president was trying to use the Ukrainian government to rig the 2020 election,"" Ingraham said on "" The Ingraham Angle ."" ""I don't see how anyone in his or her right mind could legitimately say there's an impeachable offense in this transcript, in the conversation."" UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER -- BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID The Trump Administration released a transcript of the president's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing he sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country -- but the document does not show Trump explicitly leveraging military aid as part of a quid pro quo. Ingraham argued that Democrats ""overplayed"" the situation. ""I think it's pretty obvious that the Democrats overplayed their hand big time,"" Ingraham said. ""They base their impeachment move on a whistleblower who didn't even hear the conversation and who grossly exaggerated what happened in it."" The host compared all Democrats to Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., saying there were no ""moderates left in the Democrat Party."" Ingraham also said Democrats were ""possessed"" with ""anti-Trump rage."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""They are infuriated that Mueller let them down, that Trump has beaten them pretty much at every turn.

"Forty-two percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers said they want to continue the state's caucus system, which has traditionally made the Hawkeye State the center of the early months of presidential campaigns, even if it means not everyone who wants to can participate. Iowa's status as the first state where voters weigh in on who the parties will nominate to run for the White House has given it special importance in the campaign as many candidates choose to spend much of their time meeting voters in diners and house parties across a state that demands face-to-face interactions with the candidates. However, that tradition has been questioned in recent years and now 44% of likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa say they're in favor of switching to a primary, even if it risks Iowa's status as the first contest of the nominating season. Advocates for a primary argue it would increase access to the voting process because it wouldn't require hours of participation in the same way that a caucus does. Voters in Iowa who spoke to CNN after taking the poll saw pros and cons to both sides of the argument, but many mentioned how much they enjoy the ability to meet candidates and the unique opportunity that is provided to them.  ""I've had the chance to meet just about every presidential candidate throughout my life, since I was 11. That's awesome,"" likely Iowa caucusgoer Allie Paarsmith told CNN. ""I know how lucky I am. We just wouldn't get that sort of attention otherwise, it brings people to the Midwest. It would be sad to see a Midwestern state lose that first in the nation status.""  RELATED: Full poll results Voters who tend to be more liberal or younger are more likely to prefer a primary system where voting is more accessible -- those who say they're very liberal would rather hold a primary (64%) over a caucus (30%) by a wide margin, and a majority of those under the age of 35 prefer a primary (53% primary, 36% caucus). Moderate likely Democratic caucusgoers preferred holding a caucus (52%) so that Iowa would remain as the first test for the Democratic Party rather than hold a primary (38%), as did those age 55 and older (47% caucus, 37% primary). Those who have attended a caucus before were more apt to favor a caucus (46%) than those who would be attending for the first time in 2020 (28%), and men were more likely to favor caucuses (50%) than women (37%). Paarsmith, a librarian in the greater Iowa City area, said that while she loves being able to meet candidates, she understands how hard it is for some people to have a caucus.  ""People work! Especially Democrats work all hours of the day. It really is eliminating a poorer population, typically of color, that can't attend the caucus because they're at work or recovering from a 12 hour shift,"" she said. Multiple Iowans expressed their sympathies towards those who can't take time off, and wanted to make it easier for those people, but weren't always sure if a primary system would be the solution. Kevin Cavallin, a moderate Democrat who still hasn't officially decided which candidate to support in February, is an adamant supporter of the caucus system.  ""The problem with that notion is the fact that New Hampshire is the first primary. If Iowa switches to a primary system, that violates New Hampshire and Iowa's agreement ... and to me that's unacceptable,"" he told CNN. ""I mean, it sounds selfish, but at the same time, I think the caucus system works. The advantage of Iowa is that it doesn't cost you a small fortune to campaign here.""  But almost half of those polled disagree. They don't see the caucus as that important for the state's sense of identity.  Kelli Sharpe, a 39-year-old liberal Democrat, would prefer a primary.  ""I'm actually one of the few Iowans who doesn't think we should be first in the country. I don't think that makes sense,"" she told CNN. ""We're not very many people, and we're making decisions for everybody. The primary is much more easy to pull off, it's simpler, I think that would be a better system."" Likely caucusgoers who said they turned out in 2016 for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are divided on the caucus question, with 49% in favor of a primary and 44% preferring a caucus, while those who backed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016 are more firmly in the caucus camp (53% caucus to 39% primary). Sanders' backers were part of a movement in the Democratic Party to reform the presidential primary process, which included increasing access to caucuses in states that continue to hold them. That movement led Iowa's Democratic Party to propose a new system of ""virtual caucuses,"" designed to maintain the state's long-standing caucus system while expanding participation in the process. The proposal was ultimately rebuffed by the DNC because of concerns about security for those participating remotely, and instead Iowa will add in-person satellite caucuses for those who are unable to caucus in their home precinct. Cavallin, who strongly prefers a caucus, said he still wants it to be better -- having a surrogate go in a voter's place if that person couldn't caucus or a letter of intent have been mentioned as possible reforms -- but what's most important to him is that people's voices are heard and the election is conducted fairly.  ""It's important to have the caucus, but it's also important to get it right,"" he said. ""I'm not selfish enough to say that 'I want Iowa to be first no matter what.' It's nice that we're first, but we need to do it right and we need to take it seriously.""  The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll was conducted by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, September 14 through 18 among a random sample of 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample of likely caucusgoers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points."
"The Steak Fry marks just the latest event in the  first-in-the-nation caucus state  where candidates will pitch themselves as the best contender to take on President Donald Trump.  With less than five months to go until the February 3, 2020, caucuses, candidates are putting an increased focus on the state -- and dusting off some dance moves -- in hopes Iowa voters will bolster their campaigns in a crowded Democratic primary field.  Sen. Kamala Harris of California,  who is looking to reframe her stagnating campaign by setting high expectations in Iowa , made her Steak Fry entrance alongside a marching drumline: Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who captured 2% support in Iowa in a September  CBS/YouGov Iowa poll , put on a similarly energetic display: And while Klobuchar has hit Trump's policies as ""all foam, no beer"" on the campaign trial, she said her beer on Saturday was just the opposite.  ""All beer, no foam,"" she said, beverage in hand.  Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro put less emphasis on his own moves and more focus on the mariachi band that accompanied his entrance.  ""Brought our own flavor to the #SteakFry,"" he tweeted Saturday."
"Reaction and analysis from American Center for Law and Justice executive director Jordan Sekulow. We don't yet know whether President Trump delayed some military aid to Ukraine as leverage to get  Ukraine's  president to reopen an investigation into Hunter Biden. But if we are concerned about U.S. officials inappropriately threatening aid to Ukraine, then there are others who have some explaining to do. It got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., wrote a letter to Ukraine's prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe. In the  letter , they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as ""strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine,"" the Democratic senators declared, ""We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump,"" before demanding Lutsenko ""reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation."" So, it's okay for  Democratic  senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Trump, but it's not okay for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden? PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP And then there is Joe Biden. In 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if the government did not fire the country's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. According to The New York Times, ""Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden ... who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general."" The Post reported it is ""unclear how seriously Shokin — who was under fire by U.S. and European officials for not taking a more aggressive posture toward corruption overall — was scrutinizing Burisma when he was forced out."" What is clear is that Biden bragged about getting him fired, declaring last year: ""I looked at them and said, 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' Well, son of a b----. He got fired."" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER This weekend, Biden told reporters, ""I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings."" That is flatly untrue. Hunter admitted in an interview with the New Yorker that his father expressed concern about the Burisma post at least once: ""Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing,' and I said, 'I do.'"" Moreover, the New Yorker reported, ""In December 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter's relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama administration's special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden."" So, Biden was fully aware of his son's involvement with Burisma when he pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in 2016. He should have known that his using U.S. aid as leverage to force the prosecutor's dismissal would create, at a bare minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest. On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced that Congress will initiate a formal impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine episode, a move Joe Biden endorsed in a speech, declaring, ""It's time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this president."" Such an investigation will be far more damaging for Biden than the president. It will keep the story of Biden's conflict of interest in the news through the 2020 election. Senate Republicans can demand that Hunter Biden testify, and subpoena Obama White House aides to explain under oath what the vice president knew and when he knew it. Put aside the prosecutor's firing. Hunter took the position with a Ukrainian natural gas company just a few weeks after his father visited Ukraine in 2014 to urge its government to increase its natural gas production. He had no expertise in Ukraine or natural gas. It will not just be Republicans calling this suspicious; nonpartisan experts in ethics law will testify that this a major conflict of interest. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And the focus will not just be on Ukraine. It will also be on how, as The Post reported, ""for more than two decades, [Hunter's] professional work often tracked with his father's life in politics, from Washington to Ukraine to China."" While Senate Republicans will not remove Trump from office, Democratic primary voters might decide that Biden and his troubles are a distraction they do not need. The irony is the Democrats' investigation might do more to deny Biden the presidency than Trump. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MARC THIESSEN"
"  The UN General Assembly is always a high stakes event for national security, but this year's gathering will take place amid rising tensions with Iran, a nuclearizing North Korea, the degradation of the global nonproliferation agenda, ongoing humanitarian crises and more.      And the UNGA already has a dark cloud hanging over it. As world leaders descend on New York City, they are already well aware of the urgent whistleblower complaint, lodged by a member of the intelligence community, concerning at least one of President Trump's communications with a foreign leader as well as Trump's own admission that he discussed Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Sunday,  the President said , ""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption).""    These world leaders may be convinced Trump is more concerned about his own political standing than the security of the American people. This waters down the credibility of any US national security work as our peers wonder whose interests the President and his team are really serving: America's or Trump's.      Trading places The United States has often been a champion for promoting the rule of law and anti-corruption around the world, including through the UN.  The concept of the rule of law is even embedded in the  UN charter  -- and through the  State Department  and other US government entities we have programs focused on advancing it overseas.  However, our ability to advance rule of law and anti-corruption initiatives globally takes a direct hit when the President is viewed as a poster child for the kind of actions we're trying to get other countries to stop doing.   President Trump reportedly pressed Ukraine's President Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son,  a source told CNN . And Rudy Giuliani confirmed that he also asked the Ukrainian government to investigate the former Vice President, even though there is no evidence of wrongdoing from either Joe Biden or his son Hunter.    This  news only bolsters the idea that the President is abusing his power to engage in self-dealing. Allegations of nepotism,  emoluments violations , channeling business to  Trump properties  and more have already painted a picture of a President doggedly pursuing self-interest.  Taken with new allegations of self-dealing and abuses of power, other leaders may now need to include anti-corruption talking points on their agenda when meeting with President Trump.    We have urgent business with Ukraine, including helping them to deter Russian aggression. Instead, because of the President's reported actions, the meeting may be overshadowed by the whistleblower complaint, Giuliani's efforts, and getting the story straight on their last phone call.  Ukraine has already been roped into this domestic US issue. Their Foreign Minister  issued a statement  saying that Zelensky didn't feel pressured and that Ukraine is an independent state. Zelensky and his team are trying to walk a fine line between keeping the President happy (they must know his ire has consequences ), without drowning in his political hot water. Fighting Trump's battles is likely not a priority for Zelensky. He has real ones of his own -- including an  ongoing armed conflict  with Russia -- going on at home.    This dark cloud of potential conflicts of interest and abuse of power will likely carry over into other meetings as well, like the President's meetings with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Polish President Andrzej Duda, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.      Even before the whistleblower complaint and the administration's decision to freeze security assistance to Ukraine earlier this year, world leaders were aware that  Trump is willing to cut off foreign assistance  to countries who won't (or can't) do his bidding. The idea that the President relies on explicit or implicit quid pro quos to score political wins has only been bolstered by recent events. Foreign leaders now have good reason to wonder whether incoming Trump requests are campaign 2020 calls or actually have to do with national security.    Fairweather fan    While Trump's bilateral meetings at the UNGA this week will be critical, his approach to the United Nations itself may indicate that he's a fairweather fan of the United Nations.   Even before he assumed office, President Trump had railed against the United Nations, saying it was "" not a friend of democracy ,"" and as President-elect he said the UN was causing problems and would be a waste of time and money if it didn't live up to its potential.  With his America First agenda, Trump's preferred not to play with others -- he's not a fan of coordinating with other countries through international institutions. He's withdrawn from  some UN entities  and  cut US funding to others . Trump's 2019 budget request even proposed cutting voluntary  US funding to UNICEF . His  UNGA remarks  last year even included a statement that ""America will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance, control, and domination.""   This year, the President may need to turn to the UN for support. While the formal UN agenda includes a host of topics that the President doesn't like -- including  climate change and sustainable development  -- he's probably going to try to get other member states to focus on what's top of mind for him, like  reports  that Iran was behind the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, after several months of  illegal activities in international waters, and a host of other malign activities. Iran's increasingly aggressive behavior will likely be a key topic for Trump in both public and private discussions.       The administration recently rolled out new  sanctions against Iran  and announced the deployment of more US forces to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But these actions would benefit from UN backing.  We've already cut off most transactions with Iran and these unilateral US sanctions probably won't have a lot of bite unless we're willing to punish foreign entities and individuals who violate our new sanctions or the UN passes similar ones. So making a compelling case about Iran's activities at the UNGA may be on top of Trump's to-do list.    Odd man out     While he's seeking to convince his global peers about the threat from Iran, Trump will probably try to water down their focus on another malign actor: North Korea.     North Korea conducted several  missile tests  over the last few months  -- a sign of its advancing arsenal -- and experts say its nuclear stockpile is expanding.  Trump's former National Security Adviser John Bolton said that North Korea's missile tests  violate UN Security Council resolutions , but Trump still  downplayed the missile tests . His stance on North Korea will likely be at loggerheads with that of our allies at the UN and will add to the general perception that there is no coherence when it comes to Trump's approach to rogue regimes.      While North Korea said that it welcomes a "" new method "" of talks with the US, denuclearization discussions remain stalled. Meanwhile, Trump argues that Kim "" likes testing missiles "" and he'll probably use his time at UNGA  to make the case that Kim deserves special treatment in the eyes of the international community. While many of our allies are concerned about North Korea's advancing illegal capabilities, Trump's the odd man out. Perceptions that his national security strategy is irregular and incoherent at best -- and more likely driven by naked self-interest -- will continue to proliferate"
"The letters from Sen. Bob Menendez -- sent to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Inspector General Steve Linick -- come after the New Jersey Democrat made clear on the House floor Monday that he would seek more information on the call as  House Democrats near a ""tipping point""  on impeachment in the wake of the Trump administration blocking a related whistleblower complaint's release to Congress.  On Friday,  CNN reported  Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was part o f the whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. Trump on Sunday acknowledged that he discussed Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. In his letter to Linick, Menendez requests that the Inspector General ""immediately open an investigation"" into the Trump administration's withholding of foreign military assistance to Ukraine and whether it was tied to the whistleblower complaint.  Menendez calls the withholding a ""highly unusual move and without any legitimate explanation.""  Menendez's letter to Pompeo seeks information surrounding the State Department regarding the agency's ""role in delaying assistance to the Ukraine and facilitating meetings between the President's personal attorney and Ukrainian officials to discuss a potential Ukrainian investigation intended to bolster The President's 2020 election prospects."" The letter requests a series of records surrounding the July call with a requested response by September 30. Menendez's letter to Mulvaney similarly requests details regarding the role ""the Office of Management and Budget, and you personally, played"" in blocking security assistance to the Ukraine.  Trump previously branded criticism of the call a ""Ukrainian Witch Hunt,"" while Biden accused the President of abusing his power to ""smear"" him. White House officials are considering releasing a transcript of Trump's call with the Ukrainian President,  multiple sources have told CNN , but some senior administration officials are balking at the idea and the precedent it could send. Trump on Monday remained unclear about the fate of the transcript. Earlier this month, the chairmen of the House committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight announced an investigation into allegations that Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani had pressured the Ukrainian government to back Trump's reelection campaign. And over the weekend, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  sharpened her rhetoric  on the White House's refusal to produce the whistleblower complaint."
"President Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following White House release of unredacted transcript of Ukraine call. Former Vice President Joe Biden  hit back at  President Trump  Wednesday, accusing him of putting ""personal politics above his sacred oath"" after transcripts of a controversial call between the commander-in-chief and the president of  Ukraine  were released by the White House. The call in question raises questions about whether or not  Trump attempted to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family  for possible corruption in exchange for U.S. aid and has been the catalyst for an  official impeachment inquiry against Trump , which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday. ""The 2,000-word summation of a 30-minute phone call released by the White House makes clear that days after the President ordered the delay of Congressionally-appropriated military assistance to Ukraine, he implored the President of Ukraine to work with his personal attorney to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent, using a malicious conspiracy theory that has been universally debunked by every independent outlet that has looked at it,"" Biden said in a statement. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DEFENDS UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT ACCURACY, AS DEMS THROW SHADE During the July 25 phone call between the two presidents, Trump said: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.” Trump's reference to Biden and his son relates to the former vice president's insistence that Ukraine fired its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me,” Trump said, according to the declassified transcript. The 2020 Democratic presidential contender vowed that he would ""continue to focus my campaign not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America's families."" DEMS DOBULE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE, DESCRIBE CALL AS MAFIA-STYLE 'SHAKEDOWN' Biden also urged Congress to forge ahead with impeachment proceedings, saying ""Congress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable."" Biden called the transcript, which isn't a verbate of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky but rather a summary of “notes and recollections"" from the conversation an ""abridged version that the White House was willing to issue to the public.""  ""Congress is entitled to the full whistleblower complaint, and any and all other information about this matter,"" he added. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.  who is spearheading the impeachment inquiry, set a Thursday deadline for the White House and State Department to turn over the related whistleblower complaint and other information related to the phone call but warned that the committee would issue a subpoena if the request wasn't fulfilled.

""This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It is a national security issue,"" Biden said. Fox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report. "
"WASHINGTON — Bernie Sanders has long wanted to remake the health care system so no one will have to pay directly for medical care again. Now, he also wants to go back and cancel all the medical debts of people who have been billed under the current system. In a plan released Saturday, Mr. Sanders,  the Vermont senator and presidential candidate , proposes  wiping out  an estimated $81 billion in existing debt and changing rules around debt collection and bankruptcy. He also calls for replacing the giant credit reporting agencies with a “public credit registry” that would ignore medical debt when calculating credit scores. The proposals reflect Mr. Sanders’s concern that the medical system has placed financial hardships on too many Americans, by discouraging them from seeking needed medical care — but also by saddling them with expensive and unfair bills that can harm their financial security, ding their credit and, in some cases, lead to bankruptcy.  The plan  is Mr. Sanders’s latest effort to transform the health care system in America, a goal on which he has staked not just his second presidential run, but much of his political legacy. His proposal also separates him from other  presidential candidates : While several of them have come to embrace his “Medicare for all” plan to create a government-run health insurance system, he is the first top-tier contender to call for such drastic measures on medical debt.  “We’re addressing it on both ends,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re addressing it now by trying to help the people who have past due medical bills. And we’re addressing it by finally creating a health care system that guarantees coverage to people without any premiums, without any deductibles, without any out-of-pocket expenses.” [ Sign up for our politics newsletter  and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Medical debt affects Americans who lack health insurance, of course. But it is also  increasingly affecting people who have insurance  with holes, like high deductibles or  limited networks  of doctors whose care is paid for.  Around 16 percent of adults with credit reports have at least one medical debt,  according to  a study  published last year in the journal Health Affairs. The plan calls for the government to negotiate and cancel the debts, though it does not specify the precise mechanism. While eliminating every American’s medical debt would probably not come cheap, Mr. Sanders’s plan could wind up costing far less than the total amount of debt he is seeking to cancel. Craig Antico, a founder of the charity RIP Medical Debt, which buys and forgives medical debt,  estimated that the market price for $81 billion in debt could be as low as $500 million . Most past-due medical debt never gets paid, which is why bill collectors are often willing to sell the debts for pennies on the dollar. The plan would also create a public credit rating agency to “replace” for-profit companies like Equifax, and it would exclude medical debts from credit ratings. It would establish a new legal process, managed by the bankruptcy court system, to help adjudicate medical debts that are not yet in collections. Studies suggest that medical debts can be less damaging to people’s credit than other kinds of debt, in part because the credit reporting agencies treat people’s ability to pay medical bills as less predictive of creditworthiness than, say, their ability to pay credit card bills or car payments. And, despite the news media’s focus on particularly large medical bills, the typical bill in collections is less than $600, according to the Health Affairs article. But medical debts do affect credit somewhat, and they can cause psychological stress, beyond the financial consequences. A  survey  of people with medical debts  conducted by The New York Times  and the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2016 found that 44 percent of adults under 65 who had problems paying medical bills said those bills had a “major effect” on their lives. Fear of medical debts causes some people to avoid needed medical care. And medical bills can affect other parts of people’s finances that are harder to measure, showing up as an unpaid credit card bill or a missed loan payment. “I have a belief that if a plan like this could eliminate the debt that’s causing hardship, it could make a huge difference in people’s lives,” Mr. Antico said. The Sanders campaign circulated statistics suggesting that more than 500,000 Americans declare bankruptcy each year because of medical bills. That number, derived from  a survey of bankrupt individuals , overstates the impact of medical bills on bankruptcy. The study itself noted that health problems can cause bankruptcies in two ways, through direct medical bills and through lost income due to illness itself. The 500,000 figure includes both groups.  Other research has shown that  income losses due to illness are often the bigger financial hit than medical bills . Neither Mr. Sanders’s “Medicare for all” plan nor his medical debt program would address that secondary issue, though he has also called for guaranteeing workers paid medical leave.   The plan “is well targeted,” said Neale Mahoney, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, who studies medical debt. “It just may not be that much relief.” [ Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week? ] Mr. Sanders said that, in conversations with people around the country, he had come to see medical debt as the most consistent and visceral manifestation of a broken health care system.  At an event this month in Carson City, Nev., for instance, he heard  from a veteran  who said he had $139,000 in medical debt. When Mr. Sanders asked the man how he would pay off the debt, the man responded: “I can’t. I can’t. I’m going to kill myself.”  Those kinds of deeply moving moments, he said, drove him to seek a new way to ameliorate that particular pain as part of his overall vision for changing the health care system.  “I have always believed that health care is a human right, and it has always disturbed me immensely that so many of our people are uninsured or underinsured and can’t go to the doctor,” Mr. Sanders said. “But I have learned in this campaign something else, which I didn’t talk about previously, and that is the financial pain that this dysfunctional health care system is causing people.” The new plan is part of a burst of policy-related activity from the Sanders campaign, which also released  a housing plan last week  that included a proposal to establish a  national rent control standard . Margot Sanger-Katz reported from Washington, and Sydney Ember from New York."
"President Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following White House release of unredacted transcript of Ukraine call. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during a meeting in New York with  President Trump , told reporters Wednesday that he was not pressured to investigate the Biden family during their now-controversial phone call over the summer.  “Nobody pushed me,” Zelensky said.  The comments come after the  White House released a transcript  reflecting that call. It showed Trump sought a probe into Biden family dealings in the country, though it did not show Trump explicitly linking the request to U.S. aid, as some have suggested. READ THE FULL TRANSCRIPT HERE “We had a great phone call,” Zelensky added. “It was normal.” Trump interjected afterward: “In other words, there was no pressure and you know there was no pressure.” Trump’s meeting with Zelensky comes just hours after the White House released the transcript of their summertime call and less than a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she was opening an impeachment inquiry into Trump over the issue. “She’s lost her way, she’s been taken over by the radical left,” Trump said of Pelosi. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The speaker effectively endorsed the process, which to some degree had already been underway, after facing fresh pressure from inside the caucus to act. Pelosi specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal."" But Democrats also slammed the president for seeking the Biden-related probe in Ukraine in the first place. “This is a classic Mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Wednesday. Trump had urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had been separately and widely accused of corruption. While the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to ""look into"" the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid -- millions of dollars of which had been frozen days earlier. Trump first asked Zelensky to do a ""favor"" and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyberfirm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.  UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER, BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID Then, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.  “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.” The White House and Trump allies have adamantly denied wrongdoing and described the transcript as exculpatory. White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News on Wednesday that “there’s no quid pro quo and there’s no pressure.” But Schiff downplayed the absence of any explicit quid pro quo. Schiff noted that during the call, Trump lamented that the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine was not always ""reciprocal,"" a comment he made after noting how ""very very good"" the U.S. had been to Ukraine. Zelensky went on to discuss military assistance -- after which, Trump started making his requests regarding Biden. “There is no quid pro quo necessary to betray your country or your oath of office,” Schiff said.

"Fox News contributor Andrew Napolitano on the potential legal fallout from the whistleblower controversy. A slew of key swing-district  Democrats  late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as  The New York Times ,  The Washington Post  and  The Wall Street Journal  reported in the evening that President Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  strongly suggested  she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed. ""The horse is out of the barn,"" said former Hillary Clinton  pollster and strategist   Geoff Garin . ""Saddle up."" In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. He also called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine  a ""disgrace,""  and added: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?” Joe Biden  has acknowledged  that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm  Burisma Holdings  — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump has long said he wants European countries to pay more for their own defense, and an administration official  told the Journal  that Trump's actions on the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July ""reflected the president’s concerns about how the U.S. is spending aid money and whether U.S. allies are adequately contributing."" Another official told the paper that the Trump administration internally maintained at the time that Ukraine's corruption problems were a consideration in the aid decision. Trump's decision to freeze Ukraine funding reportedly came more than a week before his call with Zelensky. ""The horse is out of the barn. Saddle up."" Fox News has not independently confirmed the reports, which rocked Capitol Hill even as Democrats insisted they were keeping the developments in perspective. While Democrats are set to meet Tuesday to discuss Ukraine and possible impeachment proceedings, the top House aide told Fox News that trade – not Ukraine – would headline Democrats' agenda at a separate planned caucus meeting Wednesday. ""The dominant focus of the caucus on Wednesday is trade,"" the aide told Fox News. ""A second caucus has been added to ensure adequate time for member discussion on the whistleblower matter and a number of other pressing matters on Tuesday afternoon.""

       Something of an impeachment inquiry dam broke late Monday, when seven centrist Democratic freshmen lawmakers who served in the military and national security announced in an op-ed that if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens for political benefit, it's impeachable. The lawmakers – Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia – come largely from swing districts where Trump is popular but voters split. The Democrats wrote in The Washington Post they ""do not arrive at this conclusion lightly."" “These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent,"" the lawmakers said. “These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do.” Later in the night, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz and Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell also endorsed an impeachment inquiry. Such an inquiry would not be an impeachment vote, but rather an investigative process that could quickly lead to actual impeachment. ""On behalf of the people who elected us, we must formalize and accelerate the impeachment process so that Congress, by exercising its responsibility under Article 1 of the Constitution, can provide some measure of accountability,"" Schatz said in a statement. The flurry of moves brings to 154 the number of House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with  one independent  -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. An unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president.) Democrats have presented conflicting views, in court and in public, as to  whether impeachment proceedings are already in progress.  The renewed push on Monday could galvanize remaining Democrats to openly call their efforts an impeachment probe. FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED Meanwhile, a  report in Politico  late Monday suggested that Democrats may vote on a resolution to condemn Trump for allegedly pressuring Ukraine's leadership to investigate possible corruption by Joe Biden's son Hunter relating to his business dealings in the country. And The Washington Post  reported  in the evening that Pelosi was sounding out members of the Democratic caucus to see if the time has come to impeach the president. However, earlier Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have ""firsthand knowledge"" of Trump's conversation with Zelensky. The source said that it was made clear  in the complaint itself that the whistleblower  did not have direct knowledge of the July phone call. Fox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials would be on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower was not one of those people. It's unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation, or learned of it another way. SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL Nevertheless, Democrats have pressed forward on the issue, even as it risked backfiring by exposing potential wrongdoing by the former vice president. ""The Senate Republican 'see no evil, hear no evil' attitude is unacceptable and must change,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Senate floor Monday. ""This again is an issue of solemn obligation. There is no wiggle room here, none."" The New York Democrat earlier in the day wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asking him to issue a subpoena and hold hearings over the complaint.

       In a floor speech Monday afternoon, the Kentucky Republican rebuffed those calls from Democrats, saying the Senate Intelligence Committee has been following an established process and was working to hear from the intelligence community's inspector general this week. ""It is regrettable that House Intelligence Committee Chairman [Adam] Schiff and Sen. Schumer have chosen to politicize the issue,"" McConnell said, calling for looking into the matter in an ""appropriate, deliberate bipartisan manner."" At least one Republican lawmaker has also called for the release of the transcript of Trump's call. ""At this stage, given the seriousness of the allegations, it’s very important that the transcript and potentially as well the whistleblower come forward,"" said Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, an occasional Trump critic and onetime presidential rival. UKRAINE CONTROVERSY BOILS OVER ON SENATE FLOOR Meanwhile, top Republicans including California Rep. Devin Nunes predicted in interviews with Fox News that the gambit  would backfire for Democrats. And in an  exclusive interview with Fox News' ""Hannity"" on Monday , Vice President Mike Pence said Democrats' accusations were about to boomerang. ""The ironic thing is is that everything that our critics in the media are leveling at the president from this phone call, and leveling at our administration, everything that Democrats on Capitol Hill are running off and describing -- Vice President Joe Biden bragged about -- which was a quid-pro-quo -- withholding American aid in exchange for a specific action,"" Pence claimed. Late Sunday evening, Trump sounded a similar note,  tweeting  the ""real story"" was that ""Sleepy Joe Biden"" had ""forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by the threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine."" Indeed, the whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. The former vice president has explained on camera that in March 2016, he  privately threatened then-President Petro Poroshenko  that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired. The prosecutor, at the time, was investigating possible corruption involving a natural gas firm with close ties to Hunter Biden. ""I said, 'You're not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'"" ""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And, they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. And earlier this year, The Hill  reported  that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros. At the same time, Trump  acknowledged Sunday  that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned ""the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."" The president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call. The whistleblower drama kicked into gear after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump repeatedly had asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham says Turmp is weighing the release of Ukraine phone call transcript. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday. Democrats have sought the full whistleblower complaint and testimony from the whistleblower. But Maguire has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi, D-Calif., warned Sunday. ""Thank you for your patriotism."" Pelosi went on: ""We must be sure that the President and his Administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President’s personal or political interest.""

       Speaking to CNN's ""State of the Union,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also said impeachment was on the table. Schiff previously has claimed to have  hard evidence  that the Trump team improperly colluded with Russia. ""Why doesn’t the president just say, 'Release the whistleblower complaint.' Clearly he’s afraid for the public to see,"" Schiff said. ""This would be the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions."" The top Democrats' rhetoric came soon after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday night kickstarted a  dormant, but long-simmering and occasionally explosive feud  with top House Democrats in the form of a fiery  tweet:  ""At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a closed-door meeting in July, in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. That meeting came shortly before the departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti. Fox News' Alex Pappas, Jake Gibson, and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Image President Trump at the United Nations this week.   Credit Justin Lane/EPA, via Shutterstock A majority of Americans have long opposed impeaching President Trump. Whether that will change, and what happens if it doesn’t, are some of many factors that will shape the political consequences for both parties. The risk to Democrats had been straightforward: With impeachment so unpopular, pursuing it would turn the nation’s attention to a rare issue in which they would be taking a position even less popular than the president himself. It might polarize the electorate’s views of Congress along the same lines, endangering the many Democrats who represent districts carried by Mr. Trump. But with Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision on Tuesday to seek impeachment, there is at least the potential for public opinion to start to shift. There isn’t much polling on the Ukraine-related allegations , which have unfolded  rapidly  over the last few days. And it will take several days before any high-quality surveys are conducted in the aftermath of Ms. Pelosi’s  announcement .  Even when those polls are released, they will yield only a glimpse of where voters stand at the beginning of what will be a long process. As more facts come out, public opinion is likely to evolve. Until now, polls have shown Americans opposing impeachment by a fairly wide margin: 56 percent to 39 percent, according to data collected  by FiveThirtyEight .  These polls were taken when the case for impeachment would have focused mainly on the Russia investigation and allegations of obstruction of justice, so they may not prove relevant to the new allegations about the president. But they represent the starting point for public opinion, and on paper they would pose a substantial political risk to Democrats. Whether that risk translates to actual damage depends in part on why so many voters have opposed impeachment, and whether that might change.  There is certainly upside for the Democrats, at least from their low starting mark (39 percent). A substantial share of opposition comes from self-identified Democrats, and it is reasonable to expect that many of these skeptics will come to their party’s side over the coming weeks.  Some of these voters may support impeachment on the merits but have questioned whether Congress should pursue it if it is unpopular or unlikely to result in Mr. Trump’s removal from office. Others might have assumed that the case for impeachment was not strong, given that the party’s elected officials have generally not supported it. They might see it differently now that support from congressional Democrats is all but unanimous.  Alone, these Democratic-leaning voters could move the polls to something close to majority support for impeachment. At best for Democrats, perhaps these voters by themselves could bring the polls to something near where they were in the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, when a slight majority of voters opposed his confirmation.  It is also possible that these easy Democratic targets would leave impeachment well short of majority support. So long as that’s true, there may be some political upside for Republicans.  Whether Democrats can move support higher will probably depend on the allegations themselves. Most voters probably have a very high threshold for supporting impeachment and removal from office, as was the case for President Bill Clinton in 1998. They might think it requires conclusive evidence of criminal activity. Even that may be insufficient.  It is hard to know whether the Ukraine allegations will cross the threshold for a majority of voters. One piece of evidence suggests that it might:  A YouGov poll , conducted on Monday, found that 55 percent would support impeachment if “President Donald Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine in order to incentivize the country’s officials to investigate” Joe Biden and his son.  Of course, it remains to be seen whether the hypothetical situation laid out in the poll will prove to be true, and persuasive to most voters. The president, along with many Republican allies, will argue it is an insufficient basis for impeachment. They will probably convince some number of Mr. Trump’s supporters of that.  But the poll at least suggests that the allegations have the potential to move public support for impeachment. The facts of the president’s conduct, of course, will not be the only factor shaping public opinion. The behavior of congressional Republicans will be crucial, perhaps especially if a modest number either support impeachment or signal the seriousness of the allegations. A strongly unified Republican Party might be able to damage Democrats for pursuing impeachment, but a divided party might not be able to do so. Of course, the conduct of Republicans and public opinion are not independent of each other. Mr. Trump’s standing could encourage or dissuade Republicans from taking his side, which would in turn help or hurt the president at the polls.  The clearest indicator of the politics of the impeachment proceedings might be the president’s approval rating. Today, it stands at around 44 percent of registered voters, according to the FiveThirtyEight  tracker .  In the past, the rating has been somewhat responsive to events: President Trump’s decision to fire the F.B.I. director James Comey quickly knocked about three points off his approval rating, for example. His lows have tended to come during periods when the news was focused on unpopular initiatives that yielded intra-Republican fights, as when the Senate rejected the health care bill or in the run-up to the passage of the tax law.  Attitudes about the president are so entrenched that it is not realistic to expect an enormous swing in his approval rating. But if it is largely unmoved over the next few months, it will suggest that Republicans could be positioned to exact a   political cost against the Democrats.  If his ratings slump, the question will be whether an eventual acquittal in the Senate would be enough to undo the damage, or more. That is very difficult to predict, which can be said for the whole impeachment process as it gets underway."
"Several personalities and guests on Fox News, the cable network that  employs a number of hosts and personalities  who have a close relationship with the Trump White House, repeatedly said the call log didn't show an explicit promise of military aide to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into Biden and his son, or a ""quid pro quo."" Effectively, the personalities and guests were suggesting the transcript either cleared Trump of wrongdoing, or didn't provide enough evidence for Democrats to move forward with impeachment.  ""To me, bottom line, no smoking gun,"" said Fox Business host Stuart Varney. The Fox News website featured mostly Trump-friendly headlines, while simultaneously criticizing other news organizations for their coverage. The July 25 phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has touched off a political firestorm, pushing Democrats to announce on Tuesday a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. The call record released by the White House on Wednesday showed Trump repeatedly pushed for Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son. The fixation from Fox and other right-wing media on the ""quid pro quo"" aspect aligned with the talking points sent to Trump allies. Those  talking points from the White House  said the rough transcript ""shows there was no quid pro quo."" Breitbart, the website which was once headed by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, featured a series of headlines that undermined what the call record released had shown.  Instead of focusing on Trump pushing Ukraine to investigate a political foe, Breitbart's headline read, ""Another Deep State Coup Blows Up!"" An accompanying headline quoted Trump saying he ""got them by surprise!""  The Gateway Pundit, a right-wing website prone to peddling conspiracy theories, featured a headline that claimed the release of the transcript threw ""cold water"" on the idea of impeachment. Another headline on the website claimed the  whistleblower's complaint , which brought the issue to light, was based on ""bogus accusations.""  It's not surprising that right-wing media organizations came to Trump's defense. Throughout his presidency, these outlets have shown a willingness to protect his administration. More traditional conservative news websites, like National Review and Washington Examiner, featured a mix of commentary, including some which were sharply critical of Trump. The National Review's David French, for instance,  published a piece  in which he said he was ""puzzled"" that ""Trump's defenders online are claiming any kind of vindication over the contents of this transcript."" A noticeable outlier in the right-wing media universe was the Drudge Report. The influential website, operated by recluse Matt Drudge, who was at one point extremely supportive of the president, spotlighted commentary critical of Trump.  One piece of commentary linked to was George Conway, the lawyer critical of Trump who is husband to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. Conway predicted Senate Republicans will ultimately turn on Trump. The Drudge Report also featured a link to commentary from Judge Andrew Napolitano which argued Trump had admitted to a crime. This is not the first time that Drudge, who has a bit of an independent streak, has  highlighted news critical  of the administration."

"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Former Vice President  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  found himself fending off new questions about his decades-long record on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, in a testy exchange with a moderator who described his treatment of her as “condescending.”  During a Friday night forum focused on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, Mr. Biden seemed to recoil from the direct questioning from Lyz Lenz, a Cedar Rapids Gazette columnist.  In a question-and-answer session, Ms. Lenz repeatedly pressed Mr. Biden about his past votes for the Defense of Marriage Act, the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy that forbade openly gay people from serving and his statement earlier this year that Vice President Mike Pence, known for his socially conservative positions, was “a decent guy.” Mr. Biden sought to defend himself, reminding the audience in a steamy auditorium that he supported same-sex marriage before President Obama. “I didn’t have to evolve,” he said.  Then, before an audience of 700 volunteers, activists and voters, he called Ms. Lenz “a lovely person,” prompting her to reply, “just asking the questions people want to know.  Offstage after their exchange, she wrote on Twitter that Mr. Biden called her “a real sweetheart.” “I interpreted it as a little condescending,” Ms. Lenz said in a backstage interview, echoing the immediate criticism of some prominent feminists on social media.  Supporters of Mr. Biden said Ms. Lenz’s questions included a series of inaccuracies. His supporters said he didn’t back “don’t ask, don’t tell” and voted for an amendment to remove the measure from a broader bill in 1993. They also argue that she misrepresented the impact of the 1994 crime bill that he championed.  Mr. Biden had already responded to criticism of his comments about Mr. Pence earlier this year,  writing on Twitter  shortly after his initial remark that “there is nothing decent about being anti-L.G.B.T.Q. rights, and that includes the vice president.”  The forum, hosted by advocacy group Glaad, marked the first extended public discussion of L.G.B.T.Q issues in the 2020 Democratic primary race, which went largely unmentioned in the Democratic debates so far despite the group representing a loyal bloc within the Democratic Party. The focus on candidates’ past departures from contemporary progressive politics stemmed in large part from the lack of daylight between most of the major candidates on issues of L.G.B.T.Q. equality: nearly all back banning  conversion therapy  for minors; rolling back the spread of rules that allow religious businesses to decline serving L.G.B.T.Q. customers; and ending the Trump administration transgender military ban. Most have promised to pass the Equality Act, legislation opposed by the White House that would bolster the list of protected classes under civil rights law to include discrimination based on “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” “It’s about time we had a woke president on these issues,” Senator Cory Booker said, “so we see everyone for the equal dignity and equal citizenship we all have.” The candidates boasted about their accomplishments — large and small — on behalf of L.G.B.T.Q Americans. Mr. Booker noted that as mayor of Newark, he had vowed not to officiate any weddings until everyone had the right to wed. Senator Elizabeth Warren opened her appearance by reading the names of 18 trans women of color who have been killed this year. Mr. Biden said he has been sympathetic to same-sex couples since he was a boy, when, he said, he and his father witnessed two men kissing while disembarking from the train station in Wilmington, Del.  “He said, ‘Joey, it’s simple,’” Mr. Biden said. “They love each other.” In a historically diverse field, the L.G.B.T.Q. community has celebrated their own record-breaking first: Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.,  the first openly gay man  to mount a major campaign for president. Though Mr. Buttigieg has collected significant financial support from leaders in the gay community, some have begun to question his commitment to their causes. While Mr. Buttigieg frequently references his husband, Chasten, at campaign events and  told his coming out story on the debate stage  last week as an example of resiliency, he hasn’t placed L.G.B.T.Q. equality at the center of his campaign. He faced questions about a ban on gay men donating blood, pointing out that as mayor he couldn’t participate in a blood drive sponsored by his office.  “It’s an example, one of many examples, of the exclusions in this country,” he said. “We are still living with the long tail of prejudices.”  Other candidates also came with long records to tout. Mr. Biden, a reliable L.G.B.T.Q. ally, frequently points to his early support of gay marriage, noting his decision to break with the Obama administration and publicly endorse the policy in 2012. Mr. Obama followed a few days later. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii faced questions about  her history of anti-gay stances , including decrying “homosexual extremists” when her home state debated whether to legalize civil unions more than a decade ago. Ms. Gabbard has apologized for her past statements and said she no longer holds those views. “My record speaks for itself,” she said, citing her history of serving with L.G.B.T.Q people in the military and congressional record of supporting equality measures.  About 5 percent of voters in the four early Democratic primary states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — identify as L.G.B.T.Q., according to data collected by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s  largest L.G.B.T.Q. rights organization . Another 23 percent prioritize L.G.B.T.Q.-inclusive policies when voting, according to the group. The event is the first of two forums hosted by L.G.B.T.Q. organizations to question the candidates on their views. A second event, hosted by Human Rights Campaign in Los Angeles, will be broadcast on CNN next month."
"Trump also asked the Ukrainian leader to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and US Attorney General William Barr on the issue, the call transcript reveals.  ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me,"" Trump says, according to the document. The release of the transcript showing Trump repeatedly pressed the Ukrainian leader to investigate a political rival comes a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the President had betrayed his oath of office and announced she is opening a formal impeachment inquiry.  Trump on Wednesday denied any wrongdoing, saying there was  ""no pressure whatsoever""  in his phone call with Zelensky. At an afternoon news conference in New York, the President added: ""I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo."" The rough transcript, which a senior White House official said was developed with assistance from voice recognition software along with note takers and experts listening, will likely amplify the Democratic impeachment effort. ""The fact is that the President of the United States, in breach of his constitutional responsibilities, has asked a foreign government to help him in his political campaign at the expense of our national security, as well as undermining the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said after the transcript was released Wednesday. ""That cannot stand. He will be held accountable. No one is above the law."" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told reporters Wednesday that the President's message to the Ukrainian President was clear, despite some debate over whether there was quid pro quo. ""There is no quid pro quo necessary to betray your country or your oath of office. Even though many read this as a quid pro quo. I'm not concerned whether it is a quid pro quo or not. Ukraine understood what this President wanted,"" the California Democrat said.  The July 25 call, which took place one day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, a source familiar with the situation previously told CNN, a revelation that has only raised more questions in the ongoing controversy. During the call, Trump suggested four times that Barr will call Zelensky and repeatedly mentions Giuliani, the Trump ally and former New York City mayor. Giuliani has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden's call in 2016 to remove the country's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company connected to Hunter Biden.  There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. On the call, Zelensky agreed to the President's request. ""Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate,"" the Ukrainian president said. He later added: ""He or she will look into the situation specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case."" Wednesday, the Ukranian leader said he did not feel pressured. ""Nobody pushed me,"" Zelensky said in a joint appearance with Trump. Trump said Wednesday evening that he's willing to release a transcript of another call with the Ukrainian president.   ""I'll release that, too, if that's important to you,"" Trump said of a call which preceded the one the public learned more about Wednesday through a newly released transcript. ""I spoke to him previous to the call that we released."" He reiterated that it was a ""very innocent"" call. 'I would like you to do us a favor' Prior to mentioning Biden, Trump criticized Mueller's testimony from the day prior and raised the possibility of looking into the US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which has been retained by Democrats and Republicans in recent years.  After getting hacked in 2016, the Democratic National Committee hired CrowdStrike to investigate the attacks. CrowdStrike publicly blamed the Russian government, which was later confirmed by Mueller's investigation. Then, Zelensky mentioned that Ukraine is ready to buy more Javelin missiles from the US, prompting Trump's reply, ""I would like you to do us a favor."" ""I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike ... I guess you have one of your wealthy people ... The server, they say Ukraine has it,"" Trump told Zelensky according to the transcript.  ""There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,"" he added. ""Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible."" There is no evidence Ukraine has the server Trump is referring to.  Trump also told Zelensky the US has been ""very, very good"" to Ukraine. ""A lot of European countries are the same way, so I think it's something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine,"" he said. Zelensky agreed, and told Trump the US is a ""much bigger partner"" to Ukraine than other European countries regarding sanctions on Russia, adding that he planned to purchase more Javelin missiles from the United States.   RELATED: Trump takes far-reaching claim of presidential immunity to court  Criminal referral The Justice Department also said Wednesday that it received a criminal referral from the Intelligence Community Inspector General in late August to investigate whether the President's push for Ukraine to investigate Biden was a violation of campaign finance law. DOJ declined to bring a case because it found that asking the Ukrainians to investigate Biden was not something of monetary value, and therefore did not run afoul of campaign finance laws. The Justice Department's examination centered on the July call. Prosecutors interviewed White House officials involved in producing the transcript to establish it was a reliable record of the call. No other interviews were done. The FBI received a separate referral from the inspector general but deferred to the DOJ criminal division which was doing its analysis, according to a senior Justice Department official. Barr was also not recused from handling the issue despite the fact that his name comes up in Trump's call with Zelensky. In the ICIG's assessment of the whistleblower complaint, they noted that ""some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate."" The ICIG still determined that the complaint was credible. Barr hasn't spoken with Trump on Biden The Justice Department says Barr has not spoken with Trump, the Ukrainian government or Giuliani about the Biden issue. ""The attorney general was first notified of the President's conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky several weeks after the call took place, when the Department of Justice learned of a potential referral. The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son,"" Department of Justice Spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement Wednesday. ""The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine -- on this or any other matter.  The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine -- on this or any other subject.  Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani,"" Kupec added. Congress reacts The immediate reaction to the transcript from congressional lawmakers was largely split down party lines. Top Democrats have concluded it showed clear evidence of Trump pressuring a foreign leader for political advantage. Republicans immediately insisted -- as has Trump -- that there was no explicit quid pro quo in the call -- an argument that is likely to form the centerpiece of the anti-impeachment case. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters that the transcript is ""pretty damning, in terms of the President trying to put pressure on a foreign government to interfere in our elections or to get dirt on his opponent,"" though he would not say if it contained evidence Trump committed an impeachable offense.  Pelosi however, asserted that the transcript only highlights the need for a formal impeachment inquiry. ""The transcript and the Justice Department's acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President's lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act,"" she said in a statement. Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called the document a ""smoking gun. ""If this is the version of events the president's team thinks is most favorable, he is in very deep jeopardy,""  Warren tweeted. The Trump 2020 campaign was quick to unleash its own offensive, and several Republicans immediately came to the President's defense. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said Democrats would be ""insane"" to impeach Trump over a telephone call.  Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley echoed that sentiment, underlining how the political terrain over the months-long impeachment fight to come is already being drawn. ""I've read the transcript in its entirety. It shows that there was no quid pro quo,"" Grassley said. This story has been updated."

"In a close race for third place, Vermont Sen.  Bernie Sanders  received 12% in the poll, followed by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor  Pete Buttigieg  with 10%. This is the fourth qualifying poll to show Hawaii Rep.  Tulsi Gabbard  with 2% support or higher, meaning she has now met both the polling and fundraising requirements to join the other 11 candidates who have qualified for the October Democratic presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.  California Sen. Kamala Harris got 3%, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Gabbard, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, investor Tom Steyer and businessman Andrew Yang received 2% each. All other candidates received 1% or less in the New Hampshire poll.  In July,  CNN's poll  with the University of New Hampshire found Biden, Warren and Sanders clustered at the top of the field, with 24% for Biden, and 19% each for Warren and Sanders.  Warren saw a significant jump in support from Monmouth's last poll of New Hampshire in May, mirroring other recent polling showing her increasing her backing in Iowa and nationally. She is up 19 percentage points since the spring in the new poll, while Biden dropped 11 percentage points, and Sanders dipped 6 percentage points.  Since May, Warren's support among those who describe themselves as liberal has increased 28 percentage points, while Sanders' has dropped 13 percentage points and Biden's down 7.  Likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire continue to prioritize beating President Donald Trump (61%) over voting for someone they agree with completely but who would have a hard time beating him (27%).  But most seem to think they can have it all if their choice wins the nomination. Almost 7 in 10 likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire said their candidate is the one they agree with the most, and over half (52%) said their candidate has the best chance against the president.  Warren holds the best favorability rating with 74% of likely New Hampshire voters who have a favorable opinion of the Massachusetts senator, 19% unfavorable. Biden's is down since May, with 66% who said they had a favorable opinion, 24% unfavorable, while Sanders receives 63% favorable, 28% unfavorable.  The Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone from September 17 to 21, 2019 with 401 New Hampshire voters who are likely to vote in the Democratic presidential primary in February 2020. Results among likely Democratic primary voters have a margin of error of +/- 4.9 percentage points."
"President Trump speaks at press conference at the Intercontinental Hotel in New York City. Conservative radio talk show  Rush Limbaugh  said Wednesday that Democrats are already experiencing ""blowback"" for taking aim against  President Trump , including their push for  impeachment  following allegations concerning the president's phone call with the president of Ukraine. ""Why is Trump at 50 percent, up to 53 now in Rasmussen? The blowback is happening. They just don’t see it,"" Limbaugh said on his radio show Wednesday, citing recent numbers in a poll often cited by the president. Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry Tuesday , following the whistleblower's complaint that Trump had improperly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. WATCH: UKRAINE PRESIDENT BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS HE WASN'T PRESSURED Limbaugh accused the media and Democrats of being ""ignorant"" when it comes to people who support the president. ""Their media is not telling them about blowback. Their media isn’t reporting what people who disagree with them are saying or doing,"" Limbaugh said. ""They’re ignorant of it."" The radio host added that he believes Democrats and the media are blinded by Trump -- calling them ""obsessed"" -- because they are unable to remove him from office. ""Hatred is a poison, folks. It is a poison. Thinking about blowback? They’re not thinking about blowback,"" Limbaugh said.

They think everybody hates the way Trump acts."""
"Andy McCarthy, John Roberts, Emily Compagno and Bret Baier break down the call transcript between President Trump and the Ukrainian president. CBS anchor Gayle King  wondered on Wednesday whether or not  President Trump  effectively put to rest legitimate concerns about his call with Ukraine in July by releasing a transcript. Trump released the transcript as Democrats suspected he tried to pressure  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  into influencing the 2020 election -- specifically, that he threatened to withhold foreign aid if Zelensky didn't investigate  former Vice President Joe Biden's  conduct. The transcript, although incomplete, did not show an explicit quid pro quo on Trump's part but did show the two leaders discussing the controversy surrounding Biden. “There's not an explicit quid pro quo here... is this a big bowl of nothing or is there really something here?” King  asked. UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER -- BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID King's question came after many Republicans accused Democratic politicians of grasping at straws in an attempt to undermine the president. ""Since  @realDonaldTrump  won in 2016, Democrats have repeatedly rushed to judgment and launched fishing expeditions – all designed to refute the will of the American people,"" Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted after King's comments on Wednesday. Democrats pushed a different narrative, claiming the administration tried to unlawfully block a whistleblower from revealing Trump's attempts to influence the  2020 election  as Biden, who was leading in numerous polls, seemed like his most likely challenger. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Members of the ""Squad,"" a group of progressive congresswomen,  derided  the transcript as even more proof that the House should impeach Trump. ""Folks, I am surprised the White House even released this transcript,"" said  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.  ""It’s worse than we thought. The President sought to use the powers of the United States government to investigate a political opponent."""
"House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi  was singing a very different tune on  impeachment  when it was President Bill Clinton who was being accused by a Republican-led House of Representatives. “Today the Republican majority is not judging the president with fairness, but impeaching him with a vengeance,"" then-House Minority Leader Pelosi declared on the House floor in December 1998. She continued, ""In the investigation of the president, fundamental principles which Americans hold dear -- fairness, privacy, checks and balances -- have been seriously violated and why? Because we are here today because the Republicans in the House are paralyzed with hatred of President Clinton. ... Until the Republicans free themselves of that hatred, our country will suffer.” PELOSI ANNOUNCES IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY -- WILL IT BACKFIRE? Clinton was impeached on Dec. 19, 1998, by the House on charges of lying under oath and obstruction of justice stemming from a lawsuit filed by Paula Jones alleging sexual harassment. On Feb. 12, 1999, the Senate acquitted Clinton in a presidential impeachment trial and he remained in office. 
The clip of Pelosi, which aired on  ""Fox & Friends""  Wednesday, went viral after House Democrats  moved forward  on an impeachment inquiry  of President Trump , alleging he may have withheld military aid to Ukraine while pressuring the country to investigate Joe Biden and his son. FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED The hosts asked former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who led the impeachment proceedings against Clinton, about Pelosi's remarks. Gingrich said, unlike the current impeachment push against Trump, Ken Starr's report alleged crimes against Clinton, prompting the House to act. ""In the case of Clinton, he had actually broken the law. He had committed a felony in a case involving sexual predation against an employee. If that happened today, people would be going crazy. That's not the case here,"" said Gingrich, claiming Hunter Biden did a lot of ""weird""  business deals  in Ukraine and China and Trump is within his rights to want that investigated. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He said historians will someday look back at House Democrats' impeachment inquiry as the ""theater of the absurd."" Gingrich noted that Trump delivered an ""extraordinary"" address  to the United Nations  on religious freedom this week, but it has gone mostly unnoticed by the media because ""the Democratic Party has lost its mind."" Pelosi announced  the impeachment inquiry  Tuesday, declaring that ""no one is above the law"" and Trump ""must be held accountable."" She alleged that Trump committed a ""betrayal of his oath of office, a betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections."""
"Fox News contributor Andrew Napolitano on the potential legal fallout from the whistleblower controversy. Fox News'  Judge Andrew Napolitano  appeared on "" Your World with Neil Cavuto "" Monday and advised  President Trump  that he shouldn't dismiss the serious allegation of ""political corruption"" levied against him. ""The president should not be diverting attention from the most serious allegation made against him, far more serious than anything ... Bob Mueller did, which is an act of political corruption in the ... formulation of foreign policy,"" Napolitano told guest host  Charles Payne . Earlier Monday, Napolitano told David Asman on Fox Business that the allegations against the president were the ""most serious charge"" to be levied against him. Payne asked Napolitano if the president should release a transcript of the phone call that sparked the whistleblower complaint. NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT ""I think it would be a great idea. It will either exonerate him or make things worse,"" Napolitano said. Napolitano also walked back analysis he made to Asman regarding  former Vice President Joe Biden  and his son Hunter's dealings with Ukraine. The judge told Asman earlier that the Biden's presidential aspirations were likely done. Napolitano told Payne he was wrong. ""I since have learned that most of Europe wanted this prosecutor to go, that he was an agent of corruption. He was not rooting out corruption,"" Napolitano claimed.

"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Former Vice President Joe Biden  is facing accusations of  sexism  this week after he pushed back on a female moderator's question about his record. The incident occurred at the ""LGBTQ Presidential Forum"" hosted by GLAAD and the Iowa Gazette on Friday.

       ""You have also praised  Vice President Mike Pence  as a decent guy,"" Lenz said, drawing boos from the crowd. ""You're a lovely person,"" Biden shot back with a smile on his face. Lenz defended herself, saying that she was just ""asking the questions that people want to know."" According to some, like Time Magazine editor Anand Giridharadas, Biden's response was related to the moderator's gender. ""Last week, Joe Biden gave us an occasion to talk about 'racism with a smile.' Now he’s doing 'sexism with a smile.' Watch him grow angry at  @lyzl 's solid question -- and then try to slap her down in the most patronizing way,"" Giridharadas tweeted on Saturday. Jamil Smith, a senior writer at Rolling Stone, similarly accused Biden of ""Paleolithic behavior."" ""I admire Lyz’s professionalism in this moment,"" he tweeted. ""Sad that it was even necessary. Biden keeps exhibiting this kind of Paleolithic behavior, and too many folks will excuse it because they’re used to seeing their male elders act like way. There is no such thing as benevolent sexism."" Others piled on with critical tweets on Saturday.

"Fox News contributor Donna Brazile, former DNC chair, says the impeachment inquiry will determine whether President Trump committed high crimes and misdemeanors. The onetime chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Donna Brazile, said Wednesday that she found a newly released rough transcript of a 30-minute phone call between  President Trump  and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy “disturbing.” Appearing on “ America’s Newsroom ” with co-hosts Bill Hemmer and Sandra Smith, Brazile also said she found Trump's call for Zelenskiy to “look into” Democratic rival  Joe Biden  by working with Attorney General William Barr and the president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, extremely “troubling.” As for what should happen, Brazile said Congress -- especially the House -- should “act accordingly, look at the facts, bring in the whistleblower, bring in more transcripts.” “Let us get to the bottom of it,” she exclaimed. WATCH: UKRAINE PRESIDENT BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS HE WASN'T PRESSURED Former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kiev. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter or Joe, a frontrunner to be Trump's Democratic rival in the 2020 election. The White House’s release of the transcript came after  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , formally announced an impeachment probe into the president. The Ukraine call is one part of a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's actions. “Well, I’m not an investigator. Nor am I a lawyer. I would hope that the White House turn over the whistleblower. They never should have stopped this complaint from going directly to Congress,” Brazile said. “I put this above my partisanship. I put this right where it should go, which is the protection of our democracy.” WHISTLEBLOWER HAD INDICATIONS OF BIAS, SOURCE TELLS FOX NEWS On Wednesday morning, the president met with world leaders at the United Nations, including Zelenskiy. In an appearance before reporters, Zelenskiy said he did not want to get involved in an American election, but added, “Nobody pushed me.” In the days before the controversial July phone call, Trump instructed his advisers to freeze $400 million in military aid for Ukraine. However, the aid package was not mentioned in the call. WATCH: PELOSI ADMITS SHE HASN'T READ THE UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT In a statement on Wednesday, Joe Biden said it was “tragedy” that the president was willing to “put personal politics above his sacred oath.” “We also learned that he planned to involve the United States Department of Justice in this scheme -- a direct attack on the core independence of that department, an independence essential to the rule of law,” he said. “This is about the protection of our country,” Brazile said. “What has he learned over the last three years? What is he doing now to protect us from any foreign meddling in our current election season?” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She told Hemmer and Smith: “Joe Biden has answered these questions. The fact is that many people do not wish to hear the answer. … And yes, if some of the other Democrats would like to take this up, take it up.

"The labor union's show of strength so far has amounted to nearly 50,000 autoworkers indefinitely on strike with the promise of being compensated only $250 per week. The strike comes at a great time for the scandal-ridden union. It offers the UAW the opportunity to restore its tarnished reputation with workers after several UAW officials were  implicated in a federal probe  last week concerning embezzled member dues. Expenses were reported for luxury items such as golf outings, expensive cigars and extended stays in private villas among other things,  according  to a federal criminal complaint. The union issued this  statement  in response to the probe: ""While these allegations are very concerning, we strongly believe that the government has misconstrued any number of facts and emphasize that these are merely allegations, not proof of wrongdoing."" It makes you question whose best interest the UAW has in mind. On Sunday they  rejected  a contract offer from GM that met several of the union's demands and could have avoided a strike altogether. Instead, both workers and the company will experience losses while the UAW tries to play hard ball. Surely, the UAW wants GM to experience some pain in order to demonstrate its value. But how long are they willing to wait it out when autoworkers' livelihoods are on the line, especially when a reasonable deal seems obtainable.  Under the proposed contract  submitted  on Sunday before the strike began, GM would have invested $7 billion in 8 facilities in four states, promising over 5,400 jobs. Additionally, workers would have gotten lump sum pay increases and an $8,000 signing bonus, among other benefits. It's not a total win for autoworkers, but it's a respectable compromise that warrants serious consideration. This strike goes beyond the basic needs and working conditions of GM employees. It taps into growing public support for unions.  According  to a recent Gallup poll, 64% of Americans approve of labor unions. Others are piling on, using the strike to advance a larger agenda for American labor like increased unionization and worker benefits. Union support has been expressed by many high-profile Democrats, such as Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Of the strike, Sanders  called  on GM to ""end the greed"" and Ocasio-Cortez  tweeted , ""In a time of record profits, workers should prosper, not suffer. That's why unions play a key role in an economy that works for everyone."" Politicians who truly stand with the American worker, should call for more thorough investigations into corruption claims like that of the UAW embezzlement scandal. They could also support the Department of Labor in their union transparency efforts, such as the recent  proposed T-1 Rule , which will bring transparency to union-controlled trusts and expose financial corruption in those funds. Both workers and GM are losing a lot of money as a result of the strike. However, the UAW is benefiting from its show of strength, as are politicians and pundits rushing to make use of the strike to advance their agendas.  For the sake of the autoworkers who want to continue making GM a success, the UAW needs to more carefully consider the best interest of workers."
"DETROIT — The Democratic presidential candidates have been chasing labor support all summer, appearing at small union halls and large conferences, and tweeting support for workers at companies like Amazon and Walmart. But now, as the United Automobile Workers, one of the nation’s largest unions, stages a strike that has even drawn words of support from President Trump, Democrats are seizing the moment to align themselves with workers in public and dramatic ways. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts walked the picket line Sunday alongside striking General Motors workers at an assembly plant in Detroit. Not to be outdone, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appeared at another G.M. assembly plant in  Kansas City , Kan. The picket line visits of two of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination — with the third, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, planning to join striking workers in Detroit on Wednesday — illustrated the importance to Democrats of winning the support of rank-and-file union members, including those who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. Taking her message of fighting inequality to Michigan for the fourth time since June, Ms. Warren joined a scrum of striking autoworkers, carrying a blue and white “U.A.W. on Strike” sign. As they crisscrossed the entrance to the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant, where Cadillacs and Chevrolets are built, the workers chanted, “We are the union, the mighty, mighty union. U.A.W. stand strong.” Ms. Warren criticized G.M. for closing plants while making billions of dollars in profits. “G.M. is demonstrating that it has no loyalty to the workers of America or the people of America,” she said. “Their only loyalty is to their own bottom line. And if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to anywhere else on this planet, they will do it.” “Everybody deserves a living wage in this country,” she said. “Let’s be clear, unions built America’s middle class and unions will rebuild America’s middle class.” U.A.W. leaders in Detroit voted unanimously a week ago to authorize the strike, the union’s first such walkout since 2007. The union is pushing G.M. to raise wages, reopen some plants and add jobs at others, and narrow the pay gap between new hires and veteran workers. Nearly 50,000 members have joined picket lines  at factories across the South an d the Midwest.  Every major Democratic presidential candidate has expressed support for the striking workers, and several have visited picket lines to appeal to union members who may have switched their support to Mr. Trump. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota joined the one in Detroit on Thursday, while Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio traveled to several in his home state and in Flint, Mich. Addressing the striking U.A.W. workers in Kansas City on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Biden wore a red T-shirt in solidarity. He referenced the bailout of General Motors during the Obama administration, telling the crowd, “We didn’t bail out GM, U.A.W. bailed out GM!” He went on to lament the high pay of executives at the company and the lack of equitable benefits for workers, and he encouraged the striking workers, acknowledging, “you’re making a hell of a sacrifice.” “There’s only one reason we have a middle class, and it’s spelled ‘U-N-I-O-N,’” he said. The crowd cheered. Auto-worker support for the Democratic Party has eroded slightly in recent years, and  about 30 percent of the union’s rank and file  were estimated to have voted for Mr. Trump  in 2016, slightly more than the share who voted for the two previous Republican presidential nominees. The departure of those voters from the Democratic Party, even as the union had officially endorsed Hillary Clinton, was particularly critical to Mr. Trump in Michigan, where  he won by the thinnest of margins  — less than 11,000 votes — to capture the state’s 16 electoral votes. Nearly three years later,  it is unclear how many of those union workers continue to  back the president. The economy has generally remained strong here, with unemployment near a 20-year low. Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat who represents a district just outside of Detroit that is home to several auto manufacturing facilities, said she felt that Mr. Trump’s support among autoworkers had held roughly steady. But she said she believed that a prolonged strike could move the president’s numbers among such workers in one direction or the other, depending on whether they viewed him as trying to help or hurt them. “If he’s perceived as trying to keep the plants open, and it’s successful, it could have a positive impact,” Ms. Dingell said. In 2016, Ms. Dingell was a  lonely voice  among Michigan Democrats as she raised concerns that Mr. Trump could carry the state, even going so far as to hold a meeting with Democratic legislators in her district several weeks before the election warning them not to underestimate his appeal. Ms. Dingell said she had heard frequently from autoworkers at dozens of community meetings in 2016 that they were “with Donald” and that they believed he sincerely cared about trade. Mr. Trump last week expressed hope that the strike would be a “quick one,” complaining about General Motors’ decision to close domestic plants and open factories offshore, and taking a swipe at the company’s leadership, which announced last November that the company would close four plants in the United States. “I got tremendous numbers of votes from the autoworkers,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. “I don’t want General Motors to be building plants outside of this country. You know they built many plants in China and Mexico and I don’t like that at all.” While Mr. Trump ran as a friend of workers, some labor leaders have said that was largely empty rhetoric. In a recent interview on Fox News, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Richard Trumka, said workers were suffering, and criticized the White House’s inaction on the minimum wage. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump had said he supported hiking the federal minimum wage, currently at $7.25 an hour, to $10. “He’s opposed every increase in the minimum wage,” Mr. Trumka said. “He’s changed the regulation to take overtime away from a couple of million people. He’s proposed trillion-dollar cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. He’s rolled back health and safety standards toward workers.”  As a crowd of about 200 waited for Ms. Warren’s arrival on a sunny day, blocking the entrance to the idled plant, some sang along to a recording of Aretha Franklin’s “Respect,” the message directed at G.M. management. Many wore red T-shirts that said “Solidarity, No More Bull.” In many ways, Ms. Warren’s central message, which emphasizes the struggles of middle- and low-income Americans, appeals to the same frustrations that Mr. Trump tapped into in 2016 — pent-up anger at an economy and system that workers view as unfair. “Personally for me, this is a lot bigger than G.M. and the autoworkers,” said Mike Mucci, a worker who was on the picket line outside the Detroit plant on Sunday. “This is a fight for the middle class.”  Mr. Mucci, 43, who said he was not a fan of Mr. Trump, predicted that the president would “do anything he could to try to take credit for saving the U.A.W.”  Robert Hatline, 61, a retired G.M. worker who voted for Mrs. Clinton in 2016, said he was impressed with Ms. Warren’s plan to provide free public college. “I like what she says if she can do it,” he said. “I want to see student loans reduced off these kids.” Carla Duckett, 60, a team leader on the Cadillac line here, said she would support whichever Democrat the U.A.W. endorsed. “I just know we’ve got to support the Democrats this time,” she said.  Ms. Klobuchar, who delivered doughnuts when she visited the picket line on Thursday, described how G.M. workers had suffered during the economic downturn and how the company had “bounced back.”  “This particular company has been making a lot of money and that means to me that you got to share it with your workers,” she said. “And that means better wages, that means health care, and that also means the long-term benefits that our workers deserve. That’s what this is about. It’s about shared prosperity, that we’re all in it together.” Mr. Sanders’s Wednesday visit will follow a stop on Tuesday at a labor rally in support of the Chicago Teachers Union. In August, Mr. Sanders released his  Workplace Democracy Plan , which he has said would double union membership during his term and give workers increased workplace protection. Mr. Ryan, who cited the closing of the Chevrolet Cruz plant in Lordstown earlier this year as the impetus for his presidential campaign, joined G.M. workers outside the idled plant last Monday. “When a group of workers lose their jobs, it causes massive disruption in the whole community,”  Mr. Ryan tweeted . “Kids of these workers have to deal w/ either move to a new state & school; or the trauma of a parent being laid off. Educators are often left to help pick up the pieces.” G.M. last year announced its plans to close the four plants, including the one in Lordstown, with hundreds of workers electing to relocate to other G.M. facilities. The Hamtramck plant, which makes the Chevrolet Impala and the Cadillac CT6, is slated to shut down in January. The idled plants have become an issue in the negotiations, with workers also pushing G.M. to improve wages, add jobs at other facilities, pay a greater share of employee health care costs, and close or narrow the difference between pay rates for new hires and veteran workers. Pointing to a $50 billion federal bailout of G.M. in 2009 following the financial crisis, as well as union concessions, many G.M. workers have said they view the decisions as particularly callous. The company paid the government back most of the money. The Democratic presidential candidates have joined picket lines in previous strikes, including the McDonald’s strike in May and the Stop & Shop strike in April, as they jockey for union endorsements. But with a couple of isolated exceptions — the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America  endorsed Mr. Sanders  last month, and the national firefighters’ union endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in April — unions  have been holding back , many waiting until they see which Democratic candidate wins the support of the rank and file. Maggie Astor, Neal E.

"WEBSTER CITY, Iowa — Iowa’s presidential caucuses disenfranchise huge blocs of voters. The state is 91 percent white. It is not easy to get to, or get around in. But to a greater degree than in recent campaigns, this unrepresentative and idiosyncratic state is proving that it is the only electoral battleground that matters for Democrats from now until caucus night on Feb. 3.  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign said it would have 110 staff members in the state by the end of this month. Senator Kamala Harris has promised to visit every week in October. Mayor Pete Buttigieg on Sunday kicked off a John McCain-like, everything-on-the-record bus tour and is advertising on local television and radio. Senator Amy Klobuchar is 49 counties into her tour of all 99 in the state. And on Monday, Senator Bernie Sanders will begin a “Bernie Beats Trump’’ tour of eastern Iowa to highlight what he says is his strength as a general election candidate. As  a new poll suggested a significant shift  in the primary race’s top tier — with Senator Elizabeth Warren overtaking Mr. Biden for first place — candidates at the annual Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines on Saturday tried to cut through  the furor surrounding President Trump, Ukraine and Mr. Biden  to deliver their message to voters still sifting through their preferences from one of the largest fields in history. The candidates’ renewed sense of  urgency  has set the stage for a four-month sprint to a night of caucuses that remains the single biggest prize in American politics. “We know that Iowa is where we can turn heads,’’ Mr. Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., said aboard his campaign bus on Sunday. “Even the other early states will be looking at what Iowa did.” The increasing focus on Iowa, where voters must attend an hourslong midwinter evening gathering to participate in choosing their party’s nominee, has come at the expense of New Hampshire, where the nation’s first primary election comes eight days later.  None of the Democratic presidential candidates are betting their entire campaigns on a strong performance in New Hampshire, meaning it may be the first time since 1984 that there is not a candidate focused solely on the Granite State in a contested presidential race. With so many candidates running, much remains unsettled. And both Iowa and New Hampshire have a history of lifting underdog candidates, with John Kerry rising from the single digits to a caucus victory in 2004 and Bill Clinton declaring himself the “comeback kid” when he finished second in New Hampshire’s 1992 primary contest.  Yet those examples, like others often cited by this year’s back-of-the-pack candidates, took place before presidential campaigns had become entirely nationalized. Nowadays, Democrats at campaign rallies in rural Iowa are more likely to recite talking points they have heard on cable news or social media than something they read in their local newspaper.  Collectively, the 10 Democrats who appeared on the debate stage in Houston this month have spent more than twice as much money on Facebook advertisements targeted to Iowans since June 29 than to people in New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, according to data from Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic political firm. No candidate in the race has a bigger chasm between online investments in the first two nominating states than Ms. Harris, of California, who since June 29 has spent $115,178 on Facebook ads in Iowa, but just $2,164 on such ads in New Hampshire. After some grumbling that she had gone more than a month since last visiting the state, Ms. Harris was overheard last week saying she was “moving to Iowa,” with an expletive added for emphasis. Her team announced last week that it would add 60 new staff members and open 10 new offices, and she plans to return weekly until Halloween. Her campaign manager told reporters she was aiming for a “top three” finish in the state. The historically large field has left even the candidates unclear about how many Democrats will have a plausible claim to continue on to New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Ms. Harris called a third place showing a goal but said she did not know if a failure to meet that threshold would doom her campaign. “I honestly don’t know,” she said in an interview before a campaign stop on Friday in Cedar Falls. “I think it will be a confluence of factors that ultimately decides how long anyone stays in and what that means.” A new poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN, released on Saturday night, showed a reordering of the Democratic field. For the first time in The Register’s poll this year, Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, at 22 percent support, led Mr. Biden, who the survey found was the first choice of 20 percent of would-be caucusgoers. Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, placed third, at 11 percent, with Mr. Buttigieg at 9 percent and Ms. Harris at 6 percent.  “This is the first major shake-up” of the race, The Register’s pollster, Ann Selzer,  told the paper .  The poll found that just one in five likely caucusgoers said they had made up their minds, and 63 percent could still be persuaded to shift their support to someone else. Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, who was tied for sixth in the poll, said after presiding over the opening of a new campaign office on Friday in Cedar Rapids that there might be more than twice as many tickets out of Iowa as usual. “You could be No. 6,” Ms. Klobuchar said before the poll results were announced. “I’m really serious, in a 20-person field and people will go, ‘Not bad.’ They’re going to look at who is in the top eight.” Mr. Buttigieg predicted a smaller number of candidates would survive Iowa. “I don’t know how many people can emerge, I think that comes down to how many people voters can keep track of,” he said. “I’d be shocked if it’s more than five.” At the moment, all of the Democratic candidates are chasing Ms. Warren. She is drawing the largest crowds in the field — 2,000 came to see her on Thursday night in Iowa City, two hours after and three miles away from a stop by Ms. Harris in Coralville that drew about 200 to a brewery. Ms. Warren declined on Sunday to take a victory lap over her new Iowa polling standing.  “I don’t do polls,” she said in Detroit,  where she marched with striking autoworkers outside a General Motors plant . “We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.”  A cadre of challengers to Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren are augmenting their Iowa operations, adding staff, opening new offices, collecting endorsements and starting new fund-raising appeals as they aim to create the aura of momentum while building organizations to turn out supporters for the state’s Feb. 3 caucuses. Ms. Klobuchar, from neighboring Minnesota,  has support from more current and former Iowa state lawmakers  than any other 2020 presidential candidate, according to Iowa Starting Line, a local political news website. And Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who tied with Ms. Klobuchar in The Register’s poll, issued an S.O.S. to supporters over the weekend, saying that without an infusion of $1.7 million by the end of the month his campaign might no longer be viable.  While Democrats elsewhere in the country, representing a national party that is increasingly diverse, offer quadrennial grumbling about Iowa, officials here aim to use their status to force the presidential candidates to focus on local issues. J. D. Scholten, a Democrat running for the seat held by Representative Steve King in a 39-county section of northwest Iowa, said he will soon schedule campaign stops across his district with each of the presidential campaigns in towns of 1,000 people or less to test their appeal to rural voters.  “I really want to see the engagement,” Mr. Scholten said at the steak fry on Saturday, which drew a crowd of more than 12,000 people. “I think that’s where I’ll see. No polling can tell me, nothing like that. I want to see whether the people’s heads nod or not.” Lisa Lerer contributed reporting from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Stephanie Saul from Detroit."

"Under Secretary of Defense for Policy John Rood's letter of certification to congressional lawmakers was a prerequisite for the release of $250 million in military aid. President Trump  has cited corruption in  Ukraine  as one of the reasons his administration withheld $250 million in military aid beginning in July, ahead of a controversial July 25 phone call with his  Ukrainian counterpart .

Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked the Pentagon Office of the Inspector General to investigate the Defense Department's potential role in withholding $250 million in military aid to Ukraine. ""I’m calling on the DoD OIG to investigate the withholding of Ukraine military aid appropriated by Congress, allegedly at the direction of the White House."" ""The delay raises questions about whether DoD officials were involved in any scheme to target a political opponent,"" he tweeted. Fox News' Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report."
"Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire says he is not partisan or political during his opening statement before the House Intelligence Committee. Foreign leaders could become more cautious when on the phone with American  presidents  following the release of the transcript of a July  phone call  between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Acting Director of National Intelligence  Joseph Maguire  said in a hearing before a  House  panel Thursday. During questioning from lawmakers on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,  Maguire  said both the ""complicated and sensitive"" nature of a whistleblower complaint on the call, and the release of the transcript itself, were ""unprecedented."" He cautioned that the release, which came amid House Democrats'  impeachment  inquiry against Trump over his alleged attempt to get Ukraine to investigate the Biden family, could have a chilling effect on what international leaders say in communications with American presidents. “I think the president when he conducts diplomacy and deals with foreign heads of state, he has every right to be able to have that information be held within the White House and the executive branch,"" Maguire said under questioning from Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio. ""I think that other future leaders when they interact with our head of state may be more cautious in what they say and reduce the interaction that they have with the president because of that release.” TRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT: READ THE DOCUMENT Congressional Democrats had been clamoring for the text of the call between Trump and Zelensky after information about the whistleblower complaint first made its way to Capitol Hill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the chamber would begin a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday as reports surfaced that Trump --soon after putting a hold on $400 million worth of military aid to Ukraine--asked Zelensky to investigate Biden's son for alleged corruption while on the board of a Ukranian gas company. ""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,""  she said . ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Trump administration denied that there was a quid-pro-quo and released the transcript of the call on Wednesday, which confirms that Trump mentioned Joe Biden's son to Zelensky, but does not show an explicit offer of military aid in exchange for what would likely have been a politically advantageous investigation for Trump. Democrats said the pressure was implicit while Trump tweeted after the transcript's release that his conversation with the Ukranian president was, ""a perfect call."""

"Democratic presidential candidate's plan takes center stage as Congress awaits White House proposal on gun control; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' Beto O'Rourke ’s hard-left turn on  gun confiscation  in the Democratic presidential primary may play well with liberal primary voters across the country – but the former congressman could also be hurting his political future in Texas should he someday choose to run statewide again. O’Rourke, who nearly won a Senate seat in Texas in 2018 against incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, declared in a primary debate earlier this month, ""Hell yes, we are going to take your AR-15."" That’s in contrast to what O’Rourke’s said in the 2018 race, when the Democrat sought to appeal to the gun-friendly state by repeatedly  telling Texans , ""If you own an AR-15, keep it."" (He also said during that race that he didn’t want more such weapons sold.) WOMAN WHO CONFRONTED O'ROURKE ON GUN CONFISCATION PLANS: 'SHAME ON HIM' FOR EXPLOITING 'OUR TRAGEDIES' In the wake of multiple recent mass shootings, including in his hometown of El Paso, O'Rourke  has proposed forcing  AR-15 owners to turn in their guns through a mandatory buyback program. The NRA  says  that Americans own over 15 million AR-15s, and that they are the most popular rifle in America for training and home defense. O'Rourke's campaign is now  selling T-shirts featuring his ""hell yes"" gun confiscation slogan. Cruz mocked O'Rourke's shift last week, noting that in 2018 he warned that O'Rourke wanted to ""take our guns,” yet fact-checker PolitiFact rated that claim “false.” ""PolitiFact — you non-partisan sexy thing you — so ... did you buy Beto’s shirt?"" Cruz  joked on Twitter . Texas political activists assert that O’Rourke can't win in Texas anymore with these positions. “O'Rourke's ‘hell yes’ to gun confiscation demonstrates how little he knows about Texans and rifles,” said JoAnn Fleming, the executive director of Grassroots America, We the People PAC, a conservative group in Texas. “By shooting off his mouth, Beto managed to end his political career in Texas, while driving up rifle sales.” O’Rourke’s rhetoric on guns has not picked up much support from his former colleagues in Congress. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who is negotiating with Senate Republicans on expanding background checks and possibly creating “red flag” laws, pushed back on the mandatory buyback idea. ""I don't know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O'Rourke,"" Schumer told reporters from upstate New York, according to t he Times Union . But O’Rourke hit back at Schumer in a fundraising email, pointing out that most Democrats nationally agree with him. “With respect to the minority leader, a recent Monmouth University poll found that nearly 70 percent of Democrats support Beto’s mandatory buyback of assault weapons,” O’Rourke’s fundraising email said. O'Rourke entered the Democratic race to great fanfare this year, but has struggled in the polls. Some Democrats have suggested he set his sights on a 2020 bid for the Senate, and not the White House. Even some liberal writers have acknowledged that O’Rourke’s gun policies could hurt him in Texas. “Beto is no longer a viable candidate for the Senate in Texas, thanks to his gun confiscation comment,” German Lopez, a writer for Vox,  wrote on Twitter . For his part, O’Rourke has been adamant that he no longer wants a Texas Senate seat, despite past pressure from some Texas Democrats and  news outlets  to drop his long-shot presidential bid and compete for Republican Sen. John Cornyn's seat instead. “There have even been some who have suggested that I stay in Texas and run for Senate,” O’Rourke said in an August speech. “But that would not be good enough for this community. That would not be good enough for El Paso. That would not be good enough for this country."" Cornyn joined the pile-on against O’Rourke’s shifting positions last week, highlighting another new O'Rourke proposal on marijuana. O’ROURKE CALLS FOR LEGALIZING MARIJUANA, RELEASING NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS “Say it ain’t so, Beto. First, grab guns of law abiding citizens and now legalize marijuana?” Cornyn tweeted. However, polling indicates that a slight majority of Texans in fact  support legalizing some quantity of marijuana . But O’Rourke would go further than legalization, proposing taxing marijuana to fund “justice grants” for people who were convicted for marijuana possession in the past. O’Rourke has also come out for impeaching President Trump. “Polls consistently show that an overwhelming majority of Texans do not support the impeachment of President Trump,” Fleming noted. A Quinnipiac  poll  found that 60 percent of Texans say Congress should not try to impeach, while only 34 percent support it. O’Rourke’s leftward shift has not been getting him traction in the polls yet. In polling averages, he gets just about 3 percent nationally. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “His far-left stance will continue to generate attention and secure him a spot on the cable news circuit. But it's not a governing philosophy, nor a winning campaign one,” Texas-based economist and political consultant Abby McCloskey told Fox News. “The far-left ground in the 2020 presidential campaign is better covered by [Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth] Warren, who clearly has thought through her proposals in detail,” McCloskey added. Fleming added: “His wild swing to gun confiscation appears to be an admission he won't ever run for office in Texas again.” Maxim Lott is executive producer of Stossel TV and creator of  ElectionBettingOdds.com .

"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders sits down with Bret Baier following the debate. For the third straight time, the  Democratic  presidential debate in Houston led with a discussion of health care. As Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., put it: ""Every one of my colleagues on this stage believes in universal health care."" Booker’s statement prompts this question: Why should government get involved in health care for Americans who do not require government assistance? Most Americans believe the  government  should provide a ""safety net"" for the poor. It does this with assistance such as food stamps. However, you do not hear anyone calling for an expansion of food stamps to cover all Americans regardless of whether they are rich or poor. So why is that the case with health care? HOW MUCH WOULD 'MEDICARE FOR ALL' COST? DEMOCRATS' HEALTH CARE PLAN EXPLAINED The federal government, through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – more commonly known as food stamps – provides  assistance  to low-income people. The government does not make the food or control the price of food. It does not dictate what foods people should buy. And the government provides absolutely no food assistance to the majority of American households. This is a ""safety net."" It is designed to make sure the poorest among us have food on their table. There seems to be broad agreement that food stamps are a good way to address the nutritional needs of our poor. In health care, we have something similar. It is called Medicaid. It provides funding for medical services for low-income and disabled people. We also have Medicare, which provides health insurance coverage for older Americans. So the government already has programs in place to take care of the health of our poor and elderly. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Until President Obama came along, there seemed to be rough consensus that this was the right way to ensure America took care of its poor and elderly. Most Americans were, presumably, in a position to take care of their own health care. Most accomplished this by working in job that provided health benefits, buying their own insurance, or relying on a parent or spouse's health insurance plan. Others chose not to buy insurance and to pay for care as they received it. Obama and his fellow Democrats insisted that every American have government health care or private insurance, and thus devised ObamaCare, which expanded Medicaid to cover more Americans. In order to cover everyone else, for the first time in our nation’s history the federal government made it illegal not to purchase a particular product: in this case, health insurance. Yes, even if you paid tens of thousands of dollars for your child to become a doctor who could take care of you for free, you still were legally obligated to buy health insurance. Now health care is again front and center for Democrats. They say ObamaCare is not enough. They insist America must provide free health care for every single American, old and young, rich and poor. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., criticized former Vice President Joe Biden’s plan in the last debate because it only covered 97 percent of Americans! For his part, Biden proudly announced that under his plan the government will tell drug companies what they can charge for drugs. With government now involved in everyone’s health care, we are seeing the adverse effects. Everyone is now on government health care or mandatory insurance, and insurance premiums cost the same regardless of a person’s heath, destroying much of the free market in health care. Where are the menus of services with prices at the doctor’s office? They are not there because people do not care what the cost is because they don’t pay it! The government and insurance companies are in the middle, determining what and how much to pay, but never sure about what services the doctor or hospital actually provided. Fraud, therefore, runs rampant. Patients have no incentive to shop for better pricing, and doctors have no incentive to provide it. Patients similarly have no financial incentive to avoid doctor visits by maintaining a proper diet and exercise. As a result, we have runaway increases in the costs of health care. The Democratic solution? For Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others on the stage, it is to put the final bullet in what is left of the free market in health care. Progressivism has taken over the Democratic Party. It no longer believes in free markets. History shows that if government would get out of the way and allow the free market to do its thing, there is no telling what solutions would emerge for health care. New technologies utilizing the Internet, cell phones, Skype, and artificial intelligence would be fully exploited. Competition would bring down prices, as we have seen in areas of medical care not covered by the government or insurance companies. Sanders complains that America is ""the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people."" America also is the richest country on Earth. Has he ever considered that the two may be related? It is precisely because America does not hand over control of large sectors of its economy to the government that we have had such economic success. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Why is a safety net insufficient for Democrats? Is it about control? Is it about destroying free-market capitalism wherever they can? Is it in pursuit of a liberal utopia where everyone is treated the same? We do not know. The question was never asked.

"White House provides unredacted text of President Trump's phone call with Ukraine's new leader Volodymyr Zelensky. Barely 100 days into his tenure as the leader of  Ukraine , Volodymyr Zelensky has been abruptly thrust into the center of a U.S. political scandal stemming from his post-election phone call with  President Trump  in July. The 41-year-old political novice – better known in his native country for his comedy and portrayal of the president on a TV show – is embroiled in an impeachment debate in the U.S. over whether Trump abused his presidential powers and sought help from Ukraine to undermine former Vice President  Joe Biden , and help his re-election. Zelensky, who has a law degree from the Kryvyi Rih Institute of Economics, had no political background when he sought to unseat former Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko earlier this year. Despite the law degree, he never worked professionally in the legal field. HILLARY CLINTON ON UKRAINE CALL: TRUMP 'HAS BETRAYED OUR COUNTRY' Campaigning on the idea of a unified Ukraine, Zelensky rode a wave of support in the country’s west and east – areas that are traditionally polarized – on his path to the presidency. He pledged to finally end the war in the country’s eastern region and root out corruption amid widespread fury over soaring prices and falling living standards. His campaign mirrored that of his character in the widely regarded television show “Servant of the People.” In the show, Zelensky played a political novice who vows to fight the country’s corrupt elite. UKRAINE CALL WHISTLEBLOWER SHOWED 'POLITICAL BIAS,' FAVORED TRUMP'S 'RIVAL' CANDIDATE: MEMO Zelensky won a  runoff election vote in April by a landslide , winning 73 percent of the vote, while Poroshenko got 24 percent. After the election win, Trump and Zelensky had a call on July 25, where the American president congratulated his Ukrainian counterpart for his win. In the call – as highlighted in a declassified transcript released by the White House on Wednesday – Trump broached the subject of Biden and his son, Hunter. While the  memo shows that Trump sought a review of Biden family dealings  in the Eastern European nation, it does not show Trump explicitly leveraging military aid as part of a quid pro quo, as Democrats have suggested in pressing forward with impeachment. READ THE FULL TRANSCRIPT HERE In the days before the phone call, Trump ordered advisers to freeze $400 million in military aid for Ukraine, prompting speculation that he was holding up the money as leverage for information on Biden. Trump has denied that charge but acknowledged pressing Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Ukraine has been a focus of U.S. interest, and recipient of millions of dollars in American aid, since a pro-Western government took power in 2014 and Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, throwing its weight behind separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine. The country has energy resources that have made it a magnet for people looking for business opportunities such as Biden’s son Hunter. TRUMP CAMPAIGN FUNDRAISES OFF TRANSCRIPT RELEASE, IMPEACHMENT PUT: 'IVE DONE NOTHING WRONG' It has a messy political scene that has turned it into a lucrative destination for political consultants and lobbyists such as former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was convicted last year on charges related to his political consulting work in the country. In his diplomatic debut, Zelensky addressed the  U.N. General Assembly  on Wednesday, steering clear of the controversy regarding the phone call and its fallout. He made no mention of the matter as he called for wide international support for his country, 5 years after Russia annexed Crimea.

           Good morning and welcome to  Fox News First .  Here's what you need to know as you start your Thursday ... Whistleblower complaint on Trump-Ukraine call declassified, contains 'no surprises,' GOP lawmaker says  
Utah Republican Rep. Chris Stewart announced on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle"" and on social media late Wednesday that the explosive whistleblower complaint concerning President Trump's July call with Ukraine's leader  has been declassified -- and Stewart said that it doesn't contain any damning information . ""The entirety of it is focused on this one thing, and that's the transcript of one phone call,"" he said. Stewart added that he was initially ""anxious"" before viewing the complaint but concluded ""this is going to go nowhere. ... there are just no surprises there."" Stewart was among bipartisan select group of intelligence committee lawmakers in the House and Senate who gained access to the whistleblower complaint in a classified setting on Wednesday. House Democrats emerging from a secure room would not divulge details of the document, but described it as disturbing and urgent. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said it ""exposed serious wrongdoing."" The complaint was not immediately available to the public but was expected to be released Thursday morning.  Click here for more on our top story. Acting Director of National Intelligence to testify before Congress on whistleblower complaint 
Rep. Stewart's claim came hours before Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was set to testify before Congress on Thursday. On Wednesday,  Maguire denied a Washington Post report  that he had threatened to turn in his resignation over concerns that the White House might try to make him stonewall Congress over the whistleblower controversy. Meanwhile, Fox News is told there was serious conversation among lawmakers as to how far Maguire could go in an open session at the hearing. One source tells Fox News the administration may have declassified the document so it could be discussed publicly during the hearing. Read the transcript of Trump's call with Ukrainian president 
The White House on Wednesday  released a declassified transcript of President Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky . It showed that Trump sought a review of former Vice President Joe Biden's efforts to have Ukraine's former top prosecutor fired. The president made the request on the call only after Zelensky first mentioned Ukraine's corruption issues, and after Trump separately requested as a ""favor"" that Ukraine help investigate foreign interference in the 2016 elections, including the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server involving the data security company CrowdStrike. Multiple news outlets, including the New York Times, CNN, and the Washington Post, inaccurately reported that the ""favor"" related specifically to investigating Biden. The transcript also did not show that Trump leveraged military aid to Ukraine to obtain a ""promise"" on a Biden investigation, as a widely cited report in the Post had claimed.  Click here to read the transcript. Trump demands 'full transparency' over whistleblower allegations -- and from Joe Biden  
A defiant President Trump said during a press conference in New York Wednesday that  he wants ""full transparency""  not only over the ""so-called whistleblower"" allegations leveled against him, but also ""from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China."" Trump also demanded ""transparency from Democrats who went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new president ... to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat."" The president's comments signaled that the White House would seek to turn the tables against Democrats who have initiated a formal impeachment inquiry. Biden, Trump's potential challenger in the 2020 presidential election, said the allegations against the president are impeachable,  but his job is to ""beat him"" in the election . Army warns soldiers to be ready for potential violence by 'incels' at 'Joker' screenings: reports

Incels are part of a subculture that identifies as involuntarily celibate, meaning they are unable to find romantic partners even though they desire one.

"When approached by CNN at the United Nations in New York, Zelensky simply responded that his conversations with President Donald Trump are ""private and confidential."" When asked if he wanted  the transcript of the call to be released , Zelensky said, ""We'll see."" Zelensky is at the center of a political storm in the United States after reports that Trump pressured him to investigate Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of Ukrainian gas company that was under investigation by Ukraine's general prosecutor while Joe Biden was vice president. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  Trump on Sunday acknowledged the phone call and that he discussed Biden, but he has denied doing anything improper. Trump tweeted Tuesday he has ""authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine."" House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry  into Trump in the wake of his admissions about the call. Trump on Tuesday indicated that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had already received permission from Ukraine to release the transcript. ""Secretary of State Pompeo recieved permission from Ukraine Government to release the transcript of the telephone call I had with their President. They don't know either what the big deal is. A total Witch Hunt Scam by the Democrats!"" Trump tweeted. CNN confirmed Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before the call with Zelensky, two senior administration officials said on Monday. The Washington Post first reported the development. The call between Trump and Zelensky, which took place one day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, the source added. The Wall Street Journal was first to report Trump pressured Zelensky during the July phone call."
"'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the released transcript of the phone call between President Trump and the Ukraine president and how it mostly corroborates the mainstream media reporting. Nancy Pelosi’s giant step toward impeachment, which she resisted for so long, may well backfire against the Democrats. But by any fair analysis, the transcript released yesterday of President Trump’s call with the Ukraine leader did not help his cause. This is not a partisan observation, as I’ve repeatedly said and written that the media coverage of Trump is relentlessly negative and often unfair. And as I noted yesterday, the press has so badly overhyped so many Trump controversies, large and small, that there is a collective numbness to the latest cries of scandal. MEDIA’S UKRAINE REPORTING PRESSURES PELOSI INTO FINALLY BACKING IMPEACHMENT But now that we have the transcript of the July call, it’s clear that the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post reports were largely accurate. It was not, as the president said yesterday, a “nothing call.” That doesn’t mean it rises to the level of an impeachable offense. It doesn’t mean there aren’t legitimate questions about Joe Biden’s intervention in Ukraine while his son was making big bucks from a gas giant. But if you flipped the script—if Barack Obama had asked Ukraine in 2011 to help investigate one of Mitt Romney’s sons—Republicans would have gone nuclear. One thing we learned from the transcript is that Trump brought up a company with Ukrainian ties that is said to have been involved in the hacking of Democratic emails during the last campaign. This came right after Volodymyr Zelensky was talking about military aid, saying “we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.” “I would like you to do us a favor, though…I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.” Crowdstrike is the company supposedly tied to the 2016 hacking. Zelensky is friendly throughout, promising cooperation, and was the first to bring up Rudy Giuliani. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Then Trump played the Biden card and referenced the former vice president pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who had what was apparently an inactive case against the Ukrainian gas giant that was paying Hunter Biden big bucks. “I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair…Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great… “There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.” So in just one week, we have confirmation that Trump did ask Zelensky to investigate his political rival, which would obviously help the president’s reelection prospects. But was there pressure? A quid pro quo? Trump did not specifically bring up military aid, but then, he didn’t have to. Zelensky was acutely aware that the White House—the president did it personally—had held up $391 million in appropriated payments to his country. “All they’re talking about is nonsense,” Trump said at the U.N. yesterday, adding: “It’s all fake stuff the media makes up with the Democrats, their partners, they’re one and the same, they’re partners.” And Zelensky, at a televised meeting, said he never felt pressured by Trump. As the pundits parse the call, this is ultimately not a legal question. High crimes and misdemeanors is whatever a majority of the House says it is. Pelosi may come to regret unleashing these forces, since polls show that impeachment remains unpopular with a majority of the country."
"Uncertainty within the market is why some farmers in Nebraska are urging Congress to pass the proposed trade deal known as the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA). The leaders of the United States, Mexico and Canada have already signed the most important trade deal in a  generation . Mexico and Canada, not China, are currently our two largest trading partners. For the sake of America’s economy and workers, this deal needs to get done. The only obstacle is political obstruction by congressional Democrats more intent on depriving President Trump of a win than bestowing one on the American people. This is politics at its worst, and that’s saying something. NEWT GINGRICH: DEM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DOING A GREAT JOB SHOWING VOTERS WHY TRUMP SHOULD BE REELECTED The United States stands to make immense economic gains from this comprehensive renegotiation of the deeply flawed 1994  North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA). The importance of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is widely recognized on both sides of the political aisle, yet more than nine months after the signing ceremony, it lingers in Congress, unratified, undebated and uncertain. As a “non-self-executing treaty,” both Houses of  Congress  have to pass the USMCA before it can take effect. Like all treaties of this magnitude, the deal deserves careful debate. But, given its broad popularity, the process should be much further along by now. The question isn’t whether the deal is worth making, but rather why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is preventing debate. Various Democratic lawmakers have suggested that they might wish to tweak certain aspects of the agreement, but so far they’ve largely avoided even learning about the details. The reasons for ratifying the USMCA as quickly as possible are readily apparent. NAFTA was poorly negotiated, typical of an era of very bad trade dealings by American leaders that hurt the people they should protect the most. Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana — two Republicans from the heartland constituencies hit hardest by NAFTA’s shortcomings — both published very persuasive arguments this past week explaining why the USMCA is so beneficial for the United States. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER They point to the higher wages and labor protections that will be, for the first time, imposed on Mexican factories that produce goods for the U.S. market. Many Mexican auto workers, for example, will have to earn at least $16 per hour in order for the cars they make to qualify for tariff-free export to America. That will decrease incentives to offshore American manufacturing jobs and give workers in Detroit a fair chance to compete. American farmers, meanwhile, will gain easier access to Canadian and Mexican markets — something they’ve been seeking in vain for decades. But while Trump was the mastermind behind the USMCA, it’s not just Republicans who are convinced of the agreement’s merits, or at least eager to keep the ball moving forward. In July, 14 House Democrats signed a letter to Pelosi urging her to let the House vote on the USMCA before year-end. We need to replace NAFTA, and Democratic leadership is the only thing standing in the way. The principles behind this deal are neither partisan nor ideological — getting a better deal for American workers and requiring more robust labor and environmental protections from our trading partners are goals that the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have explicitly endorsed, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, even as she rejects the USMCA. The Warren example sheds a revealing light on Pelosi’s obstructionism. It’s clear as day why Warren is opposing USMCA. She’s running for president against the man whose vision and determination made the deal a reality. Of course, she opposes it. Warren’s cover story is that she thinks the USMCA is too lenient on pharmaceutical companies, but there’s no evidence the deal would actually raise drug prices for Americans. In any event, the place to bring up such concerns would be during open debate in Congress, where they could be addressed in the final deal, assuming Warren could get enough of her colleagues to share her tongue-in-cheek skepticism. The same logic is at work with Pelosi. She is stalling, refusing to set a date, and dodging questions about whether it protects workers and the environment — despite the fact the USMCA has the most robust labor and environmental protections of any major trade deal the United States has ever signed. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Like Warren, Pelosi’s opposition is just politics at its worst — and that’s saying something. If Pelosi really believes the protections are insufficient, then she and her allies should suggest modifications, or even pass USMCA and request that the U.S. trade representative work with our partners to improve the deal going forward. The only reason Democrats are dragging their feet on the USMCA is because they wish to deny Trump a hard-fought win as we approach an election year. That Machiavellian approach is not what America’s economy and workers need right now. We need to replace NAFTA, and the Democratic Party’s leadership is the only thing standing in the way.

"2020 Democratic presidential candidate John Delaney said the party's frontrunners are all at risk of losing to President Trump in the general election.&nbsp; 2020   Democratic  presidential candidate  John Delaney  claimed Monday the party's front-runners are at risk of losing to  President Trump  in the general election and said they must scale back their rhetoric to win over moderate voters. ""Our three front-runners... most Democrats know, are inherently vulnerable,"" he said on "" America's Newsroom ."" ""And that’s a real problem... Our top three candidates, I think, have significant weaknesses in a general election."" Delaney said the candidates' platforms are moving too far left and will end up scaring away voters who favor private insurance and economic growth. ""Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are fundamentally running on almost like a government takeover of the private economy of the United States of America,"" he said. ""That's not what the American people want. And Vice President Biden... isn’t putting forth the kind of new ideas that I think the American people are looking for. MIKA BRZEZINSKI TO JOHN KERRY: 'WHY WOULDN'T YOU RUN' AGAINST TRUMP IN 2020? ""The American people want someone who can tell a story about how we actually can be better and put forth new ideas,"" Delaney continued. ""And I don’t think the American people are seeing that."" He also said the party should unite in its effort to defeat Trump, and articulate moderate positions to help gain momentum heading into 2020. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The No. 1 issue for Democrats by any measure, is beating Donald Trump,"" he said earlier in the interview. ""And if we put forth a candidate that [is] running on things that not even a majority of Democrats support... like 'Medicare-for-all.' Making private insurance illegal is not even supported by a majority of Democrats. ""If we put up candidates running on some of those kinds of things I think we have a real problem,"" Delaney added."
"House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., questioned Monday the validity of accusations that President Trump  pressured  the president of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President  Joe Biden's  son. Responding on  ""Fox & Friends,""  Nunes argued that the left is accusing Trump of abusing his office, but Biden is accused of the same thing. ""The very thing they're accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did and admitted that he did,"" said Nunes, decrying that the whistleblower's secrets are ""spilling out"" to various media outlets. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE' Utah Sen.  Mitt Romney , who has recently said he may decline to support  President Trump ’s reelection bid,  tweeted on Sunday  that it would be ‘troubling in the extreme’ if the president appealed to his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter. In a tweet on Sunday, Romney said it was ""critical for the facts to come out.” Trump called his conversations with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy “perfectly fine and routine."" Biden has said in the past  that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden’s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Nunes said the details from the whistleblower complaint still have not been confirmed to Congress. He said the inspector general for the intelligence community met with lawmakers last week, but did not reveal anything. Nunes said the committee is scheduled to meet soon with the acting director of national intelligence, where he hopes more information will be shared. He claimed the story is playing out in a similar way to the Russia collusion accusations. ""Doesn't it feel like the Russia hoax all over again? It's like the Ukrainian hoax,"" he said."
"Media say he raised Biden in Ukraine call. As of today,  Donald Trump  is now the least liked president in almost 40 years. The September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday shows that 69 percent of voters dislike Trump. That is a toxic level in any race let alone one for the  presidency . It is impossible to improve that sentiment to less than 50 percent in the remaining 14 months before the  2020 election . Prior to this poll, the highest dislike of a president was 42 percent for George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina in March 2006. ANDREW MCCARTHY: WHAT IS TRUMP-BIDEN CLASH OVER UKRAINE AND WHISTLEBLOWER ALL ABOUT? In the same poll, 49 percent say they’re very uncomfortable with Trump’s 2020 candidacy. That’s compared with 41 percent for Bernie Sanders and 33 percent apiece for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Furthermore, a record 50 percent dislike Trump and his policies. Other polls show Trump losing a general election to any of the top five Democratic candidates for president. Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why Trump allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the front-runner in the crowded Democratic primary field. That should concern every American. It has been widely reported that Trump asked the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, eight times in a July phone call to investigate whether Biden, while vice president, acted improperly in pressuring the resignation of a Ukraine prosecutor whose office was investigating a company that employed Biden's son. Trump denies these allegations and the Ukrainian foreign minister said Saturday, “I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure.” It was also reported that Trump threatened to withhold $250 million in military aid from Ukraine if they didn’t cooperate. That money was released this month. Furthermore, Trump insisted that Ukraine work on the matter with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, not official representatives of the U.S. government. However, if these reports are  true, a request to benefit Trump’s political prospects, rather than United States or its national security, is illegal. Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why he allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner. Trump's acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, refused to discuss the complaint that brought this matter to light when he appeared before the House Intelligence Committee last week and refused to provide the whistleblower complaint to Congress … which they are legally entitled to receive. In addition to allegedly seeking assistance from a foreign government to interfere in our election,Trump has done nothing to secure our election systems. In June, the House passed the Secure Election Act, which authorized $600 million for states to bolster election systems. The act would require the implementation of cybersecurity safeguards for hardware and software used in elections, bar wireless communication devices in election systems, and require electronic voting machines be manufactured in the United States. However, the Senate had not taken up the measure because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was refusing to do so. Until last week. Out of the blue, just one day after the Ukraine story broke, McConnell approved $250 million for election security, a token amount that will provide only $5 million per state to fight the Russians and will  have little real effect. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER It seems McConnell, who takes umbrage with his nickname “Moscow Mitch,"" may have been trying to head off criticism about foreign election interference with this gesture. But it is just that, a gesture. There are 406 days until next year's general election – and only 133 until the 2020 caucuses and primaries begin – and the resources and reforms to guard against foreign interference are not close to what is needed. It appears Trump is so worried about his poll numbers that he thinks he needs outside help to win and  that no one can or will stop him … again. If that is  true, then Trump is acting in a decidedly un-American fashion. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He should be held accountable. Every member of Congress and every American should stand up to Trump and for the rule of law. That is the American way. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MARY ANNE MARSH"
"Sign up here  to get On Politics in your inbox. It’s been a crazy week in The New York Times’s Washington bureau. The Capitol quakes with impeachment fever. An anonymous whistle-blower, allegations of a secret deal with a foreign leader and a  president throwing out accusations of treason : At this point, I wouldn’t be surprised if Jason Bourne shows up. Confused about what it all means? We’re here to help.  Has President Trump broken the law?  There’s some evidence that Mr. Trump may have broken a law barring the solicitation of foreign campaign contributions, by trying to enlist the Ukrainians to essentially collect opposition research against Joe Biden. But impeachment isn’t actually about, well,  laws.  Under the Constitution, the president, vice president and high-ranking officials can be removed from office if they commit “high crimes and misdemeanors” — a term that’s been interpreted as an abuse of power.  Put another way,  by former President Gerald Ford : “An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.” Who supports moving forward with impeachment? As of today, more than  90 percent  of House Democrats  support an impeachment inquiry, as do all the leading Democratic presidential candidates. How does the public feel?  We don’t really know . Previous  polling has consistently shown that a majority of Americans oppose impeaching Mr. Trump,  but those polls were taken when an inquiry would have focused primarily on the Russia investigation. It will take some time to measure whether the recent Ukraine-related allegations change that dynamic.  How does impeachment work?  We have  a chart for that ! Right now, six committees in the Democratic-controlled House are investigating Mr. Trump. If the investigations conclude there are reasons to impeach, the House Judiciary Committee will draw up articles of impeachment and hold a committee vote, which would be followed by a full House vote. If at least one of the articles gets a majority vote, the president is impeached. That’s kind of like an indictment.  Then, the process moves to a kind of “trial” in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a team of lawmakers from the House, known as managers, play the role of prosecutors. The president has defense lawyers, and the senators serve as the jury. If at least two-thirds of the Senate found Mr. Trump guilty, he would be removed from office and the vice president would take over. But, wait! It’s possible that Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, could refuse to hold a trial — a move that would  overturn long-held Senate rules  but  might not be unconstitutional . How long will this all take? As long as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants.  But there’s a strong political argument for moving the process forward this year, given that it gets harder for Democrats to make their case as the election nears — and voters could throw Mr. Trump out of office anyhow. Historically, the process  has taken   about four months .  How likely is it that Mr. Trump will be removed from office at the end of all this? Not very. There are no signs that Senate Republicans have any appetite for investigating Mr. Trump. To reach a two-thirds majority in the Senate, at least 20 Republicans would have to vote with every Democrat to remove Mr. Trump from office. No House Republicans and only two Senate Republicans back any kind of investigation into Mr. Trump. Here’s how Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who described the allegations against Mr. Trump as “deeply troubling,” explained his party’s resistance  earlier this week :  There’s such enormous power associated with being the party in power, both in the White House as well as in the Senate and the House. … I think it’s very natural for people to look at circumstances and see them in the light that’s most amenable to their maintaining power, and doing things to preserve that power. How does this effect the 2020 election? This clearly leads to a Joe Walsh surge in Arizona, a Joe Sestak victory in North Dakota and Mayor Pete Buttigieg dropping out of the race to become a professor of 16th century art history.  Seriously, though, no one really knows.  As my colleague  Reid Epstein and I wrote today , it’s probably not great for the lower-polling candidates, who will now face an even greater struggle to get media attention.  How it impacts the front-runners in the race — Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren — is a topic of great debate within Democratic circles right now. We’ve never seen an impeachment inquiry quite like this, leaving the candidates, strategists and assorted prognosticators navigating uncharted political waters.  Also important to remember: Mr. Trump  can  run for re-election even if he’s impeached by the House. And  maybe even  if he’s removed by the Senate, too. Want to read what we’re reading? Check out  the full whistle-blower complaint  and the non-verbatim  “transcript” released by the White House  of Mr. Trump’s call with the Ukrainian president.

How impeachment is playing in Iowa My colleagues Sydney Ember and Trip Gabriel spent time in Iowa this week talking to voters at Democratic primary events about the prospect of impeachment. Here’s some of what they heard: “What Trump has said, to me, tells me he’s doubling down on lying. He’s straight up lying about what he did,” said  Tony Faralli , a 69-year-old retiree from East Moline, Ill., who was at an event for Senator Bernie Sanders in Davenport, Iowa, this week. “When it’s all said and done, he can’t go to jail. We’re going to beat him.” But Tim and Melody Klouser, Illinois residents who crossed the Mississippi River to hear Mr. Buttigieg in Dubuque, Iowa, shrugged off reports that President Trump had asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son. “I think things like that go on all the time in politics; it’s a dirty business,” said Mr. Klouser, 59, a retired worker at a tire plant. “I don’t think a lot of the things that he’s doing are that bad.” Also waiting for Mr. Buttigieg on Monday night were Jan and Paul Wiedemann. They disagreed over the need to impeach.  “I do not understand why the impeachment process hasn’t started,” said Ms. Wiedemann, 64, a retired elementary schoolteacher.  Mr. Wiedemann, 65, also retired from the school system, said he wanted to see Mr. Trump removed from office, but at the voting booth. “If he gets impeached, you know who we get?” he said, referring to Vice President Mike Pence. For more on how impeachment is dividing voters,  check out Trip’s report  from Iowa.  What to read tonight … Seriously Is this art? If you think so, you probably disapprove of Mr. Trump’s job performance.  The image in question is  Sam Gilliam’s 1980 drawing “Coffee Thyme.”  Data for Progress, a progressive think tank, and the polling firm YouGov Blue showed this picture to respondents and asked them whether they considered it art. Those who did were more likely to hold negative views of Mr. Trump. Vox first reported on the study, which showed that the gap in Trump approval between people who think “Coffee Thyme” is art and those who don’t is bigger than the gap between people with and without college degrees.

"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking today in entertainment. ""Real Time"" host  Bill Maher  took aim at Democrats on Friday night for their renewed opposition toward Supreme Court Justice  Brett Kavanaugh , telling them that ""going after a guy for what he did in high school"" looks bad. Maher began the show's panel-discussion segment by citing the ""Kavanaugh effect"" and the implication that four vulnerable Democrats lost their U.S. Senate seats in 2018 because of their opposition to the then-Supreme Court nominee -- noting that Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who backed President Trump's appointment of Kavanaugh, was the only red-state Democrat to keep his job. ""People did not like going after a guy for what he did in high school,""  Maher said . ""It looked bad -- and now Democrats are talking about impeaching him again?"" NYT REPORTERS CLAIMED KAVANAUGH AGREED TO BE INTERVIEWED 'IF THEY WROTE THAT THEY DIDN'T TALK TO HIM ""People did not like going after a guy for what he did in high school. It looked bad -- and now Democrats are talking about impeaching him again?"" CNN commentator Tim Naftali -- the historian and former director of the Nixon Library in California -- defended the Democrats' opposition to Kavanaugh, suggesting if there was a ""dark cloud"" above the justice, it should be pursued. ""From high school?"" Maher reacted. MSNBC analyst Heather McGhee sided with Naftali, stressing that the controversy is about Kavanaugh's ""character."" But Maher doubled down. ""So you're saying at 17, you have to have your fully-formed character,"" Maher exclaimed. ""Ruth Bader Ginsburg said glowing things about him. I think he's an a------. I think he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court."" ""Sometimes you have to do a fight even if you can't win,"" Naftali said. ""But what were you like at 17?!"" Maher shot back. ""I'm just telling you what the politics is... People don't think you should go back to age 17. It just strikes them as preposterous and by the way, it's counterproductive for Democrats winning."" ""People don't think you should go back to age 17. It just strikes them as preposterous."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Last week, The New York Times  walked back  an explosive report about a resurfaced allegation of sexual assault against Kavanaugh from his college days. The piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly was adapted from their forthcoming book, ""The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,"" and alleged that there was corroboration of an incident in which Kavanaugh, as a college student at Yale, exposed himself to a female classmate at a party. But the Times was forced to issue an  update  that included the significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the purported sexual assault. The newspaper also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode. Several Democratic lawmakers have called for Kavanaugh's impeachment, including 2020 presidential candidates Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass."
"Trump says Democrats' impeachment inquiry is a continuation of the 'witch hunt.' Without having seen or read the released transcript of  President Trump’ s telephone conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stepped before cameras and microphones on Wednesday morning and boldly condemned President Trump for using a foreign nation to help his forthcoming presidential campaign.  But that’s not quite what the conversation revealed.  No matter.   Pelosi  and rabid Trump-hating Democrats long ago preordained their  impeachment ambitions . Any pretext to achieve that end will do just fine. But the speaker’s pronouncement without first learning the essential facts was a stunning admission of partisan bias. All pretense has now been shed. Pelosi and her confederates will do anything to undo the 2016 election results and drive Trump from office. Nevertheless, facts are stubborn things.  They are critical, if not dispositive, in legal cases.  They are also highly relevant in the inherently political process known as impeachment. MARC THIESSEN: TRUMP, UKRAINE AND DEMOCRATS' DOUBLE STANDARD So, let’s examine what we have learned so far, realizing that many more facts have yet to be unspooled in what Trump is now calling the latest version of the interminable “witch hunt.”  The Telephone Conversation The early reporting on the leaked conversation with Zelensky alleged that Trump demanded a “quid pro quo.” That is, Trump allegedly ordered Ukraine to help investigate allegations of corruption involving Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, or the U.S. would withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine.  However, the transcript shows no demands or conditions were stated or otherwise discussed.  No promises were contingent on financial assistance.  Did President Trump apply pressure on Zelensky?  There is no evidence of that in their discussion.   Instead, after congratulating the Ukrainian president on his election to office, Trump asked Zelensky to help investigate matters of alleged wrongdoing involving “this whole situation with Ukraine.”  Trump made vague references to Crowdstrike and “the server.” This appears to be a reference to the origins of the Russia “collusion” investigation and the suspected role of Ukraine, the Democratic National Committee, and the cybersecurity firm that the DNC retained to examine hacked servers. This part of the conversation is cryptic.  But if Ukraine possesses some evidence of corrupt acts involving Democrats or Hillary Clinton surrogates or anyone else, this would logically be something that the U.S. should be made aware of. The phone conversation between the two leaders then turned to fired Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin.  Trump remarked how “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.”  The videotape of Biden boasting of the “quid pro quo” he engineered is a remarkable lesson in hubris and foolishness. The speaker’s pronouncement without first learning the essential facts was a stunning admission of partisan bias. All pretense has now been shed. By way of background, Shokin is on record telling the Washington Post that he was fired in 2015 because he was investigating Hunter Biden and his Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, and that then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion dollars in U.S. aid unless Shokin was sacked: “I will answer that the activities of Burisma, the involvement of his son, Hunter Biden, and the (prosecutor general’s office) investigators on his tail, are the only, I emphasize, the only motives for organizing my resignation.” Fast forward to the July 25, 2019 Trump-Zelensky telephone call. Zelensky volunteered that a new investigator would look into the matter. Trump asked Zelensky to speak with Attorney General William Barr and the president’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani about it. This was not unreasonable.   Democrats, like Pelosi, claim that the conversation is absolute proof that Trump was asking a foreign government to help him damage his political opponent, Biden, in the upcoming election. But the proof is not absolute at all. If the president of the United States is made aware of suspected corrupt acts by a public official involving a foreign nation, he has every right to ask that nation to either investigate and/or produce any evidence. Indeed, it is incumbent on him to do so. One of the president’s fundamental duties is identified in the “take care” clause (or “faithful execution” clause) of the U.S. Constitution. It imposes duty on the chief executive to take care “that the Laws be faithfully executed.” President George Washington observed, “it is my duty to see the Laws executed; to permit them to be trampled upon with impunity would be repugnant to that duty.”  Whether it be immigration laws or finance laws or criminal statutes, the president is duty-bound to enforce all laws. Failure to do so would be a dereliction of his duty, as our first president believed. Biden does not get immunity simply because he used to be vice president or is currently running for president. Was Biden’s confessed “quid pro quo” pressure on Ukraine a potential crime? More facts and evidence is needed. But using your public office to benefit your son might constitute such corruption crimes as bribery or honest services fraud. On this basis, Trump had every right to ask for evidentiary assistance from a foreign power.   Unlike Biden, who threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. taxpayer money from Ukraine, Trump did not explicitly mention the freezing of roughly $400 million from Kiev. The president has repeatedly stated he put a hold on the funds because he was reticent about giving such an enormous sum of money to a newly elected president who was taking over a government widely known for corruption.   As columnist Marc Thiessen pointed out in the Washington Post, Democratic Senators Robert Menendez, Richard Durban, and Patrick Leahy had been far more overt two months earlier when, in a letter, “they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake” if the nation’s prosecutor general did not capitulate to their own demands over the closing of several investigations connected to the Mueller investigation.  Hypocrisy, of course, is rampant throughout this sordid story.   The “Whistleblower” Complaint All of this came to a sudden boil when a complaint was filed recently by a so-far unidentified employee of the intelligence community. Citing the Trump-Zelensky conversation that he or she did not hear or even read in transcript form, the employee nevertheless filed a whistleblower complaint against the president based on nothing more than hearsay. The complaint was legal folly. It does not qualify as a whistleblower complaint as defined by the whistleblower statute (50 U.S.C. 3033). Why? Because a whistleblower cannot blow the whistle on the president. This means that he or she is not really a “whistleblower” at all under the specific language and meaning of the law, as I argued in my column last week. This was explained in an 11-page opinion by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) when it issued the follow opinion: “The president is not a member of the intelligence community, and his communication with a foreign leader involved no intelligence operation or other activity aimed at collecting or analyzing foreign intelligence.” Under the whistleblower statute, both these conditions are required.  Yet, neither were met.  As a consequence, the complaint “does not trigger a reporting obligation” to Congress by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).  This DOJ opinion is also shared by the General Counsel in the Office of the DNI. Pelosi declared that the law is “unequivocal” that the DNI “shall” give Congress the whistleblower complaint.  This would be true if the complaint qualified under the whistleblower law, but it does not. Pelosi was incorrect. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  The OLC opinion made clear that the complaint “does not trigger a reporting obligation” and that the DNI does not have “a statutory obligation to forward the complaint to the intelligence committees.” In our constitutional form of government, the president is a unitary executive.  He is not in any department or agency. He is not a member of the intelligence community. A “whistleblower” can only complain about misconduct by someone in the intelligence community. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Acting DNI Joseph Maguire will appear at a public congressional hearing on Thursday. He will surely reiterate all of the above so that Pelosi, who bragged that she is an “authority” on the law, might understand what the law actually means. Despite all of this, the speaker and Democrats are determined to pursue their impeachment dreams. Facts and evidence are of little consequence. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GREGG JARRETT    "

"The whistleblower complaint calls into question the validity of the Trump-Ukraine call transcript. Two sections of the publicly released report have been redacted; Catherine Herridge reports. As he read the contents of the  whistleblower complaint , MSNBC's Chris Matthews declared Thursday that Democrats have the evidence they need to impeach  President Trump . The complaint alleged that Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from a foreign country in the 2020 election -- and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call. ""He sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader, to take action to help the president's 2020 reelection bid. There it is, that line. He did what he's been accused of doing. It's impeachable,"" said Matthews, reading from the complaint, along with fellow MSNBC hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. TRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALLEGES BIDEN CORRUPTION, SAYS DEMS THREATENED UKRAINE AID MULTIPLE TIMES ""It's a moment, and Democrats, if they've got brains, and any political savvy– will grab this moment. No more hearings, no more subpoenas, no more contempt citations... they've got him."" The rough transcript of the July call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was released a day earlier by the White House. It confirmed that Trump sought an investigation from Ukraine into the Biden family, though it did not show the president explicitly leveraging U.S. aid as had initially been suggested in some media reports. But the whistleblower complaint, released by the Democrat-led House Intelligence Committee ahead of testimony from Acting  Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire , goes further, though it is not a first-hand account of the call. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The whistleblower, who remains anonymous, says in the complaint that White House officials who heard the call were ""deeply disturbed"" by it, and that White House lawyers discussed how to handle the call ""because of the likelihood, in the officials' retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain."" ""In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced -- as is customary -- by the White House Situation Room,""  the complaint  says. READ THE COMPLAINT Fox News' Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report."
"Under fire, Trump has revived one of his favorite defensive tactics: trying to turn the spotlight onto his opponent.  Trump has made a series of allegations about Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden over the last week. The essence of Trump's argument is that Joe Biden was improperly trying to help Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, when Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire the country's prosecutor general.  But there are significant holes in Trump's story. Some of his allegations have been false. Others have been missing important context. Trump's missing context: What happened with the Ukrainian prosecutor In castigating Biden's effort to get the prosecutor general fired, Trump has declined to mention an important fact: a whole lot of other people were also trying to get him fired at the time. The Obama administration, American allies, the International Monetary Fund and  Ukrainian anti-corruption activists , among others, had all made clear that they were displeased with the performance of Viktor Shokin, who became prosecutor general in 2015.  Shokin was widely faulted for  declining to bring prosecutions of elites' corruption , and he was even  accused of hindering corruption investigations . His deputy, Vitaliy Kasko, resigned in February 2016,  alleging  that Shokin's office was itself corrupt.  The International Monetary Fund warned Ukraine in February 2016 that it risked losing financial support if it did not clean up its act. The Financial Times explained in its article on the warning that then-President Petro Poroshenko was facing pressure to replace Shokin, whom the newspaper described as a ""long-time loyalist"" of the president; the  article  continued, ""Mr. Shokin has been criticized for failing to bring to justice any of the snipers who killed dozens of protesters in central Kiev in the final days of the revolution, and for dragging his feet over investigating senior officials and businesspeople.""  In a September 2015 speech, the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, used blunt language in criticizing Shokin,  blasting  ""corrupt actors within the Prosecutor General's Office"" who were ""making things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform."" Then, during a visit to Ukraine, Biden, who had  long handled Ukraine issues for the Obama administration , applied public and private pressure on the government.  In a speech to Ukraine's legislature, Biden  said , ""The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform.""  The most detailed account of Biden's private words comes from Biden himself. At a Council on Foreign Relations event in 2018, he  recounted  that he had threatened to withhold a ""billion-dollar loan guarantee"" unless Poroshenko followed through on what Biden said was a ""commitment"" to ""take action against the state prosecutor."" ""I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time,"" Biden said. The timeline here is fuzzy: Shokin was not actually terminated while Biden was in the country, as Biden's story made it sound. Ukraine's legislature  voted  to fire Shokin in March 2016; Biden's  last visit  to Ukraine before the firing was in December 2015. Biden did have a  phone call  with Poroshenko the week before the dismissal. Biden spokesman Andrew Bates told CNN that Shokin's removal was a ""focus"" for Biden ""during numerous trips and phone conversations,"" since the prosecutor was such a major impediment to anti-corruption efforts.  What Trump has been getting wrong Trump is free to criticize Hunter Biden for taking a position with a Ukrainian company at the same time as his father was directly involved in Ukrainian issues. And Trump is free to criticize Joe Biden for declining to recuse himself from a matter that could conceivably have affected his son's interests.  But Trump has been inaccurate about some of the key facts of the situation.  Claim 1: Trump says Biden called for the firing of a prosecutor ""investigating his son"" Trump has repeatedly claimed Shokin was investigating Hunter Biden. For example, Trump  alleged  Saturday that the media wants to avoid talking about the ""Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son...""  But there is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation.  The investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors  since 2014 . The United Kingdom had  begun  investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board. ""Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws -- at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,"" Shokin's successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko,  told Bloomberg . Of a 2013 business transaction that was part of the investigation, Lutsenko said, ""(Hunter) Biden was definitely not involved. We do not have any grounds to think that there was any wrongdoing starting from 2014.""  It is not clear how hard Shokin was investigating even Zlochevsky or Burisma at the time Joe Biden pushed for Shokin's firing. Kasko, the prosecutor who resigned from Shokin's office,  told Bloomberg  that the case was dormant at the time of Joe Biden's intervention: ""There was no pressure from anyone from the US to close cases against Zlochevsky. It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.""  Shokin  told The Hill  for an April 2019 article that he had made ""specific plans"" before his firing that ""included interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.""  But his assertion that the investigation was active has been challenged.  ""Shokin was not investigating. He didn't want to investigate Burisma,"" Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Center,  told the Washington Post  for a July article. ""And Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation."" Claim 2: Trump says Biden told Ukraine to take Shokin off the case ""Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case,"" Trump  said  last week.  There is no evidence Biden ever called for Shokin to be ""taken off the case."" In fact, there is no evidence that Biden mentioned the case at all when discussing Shokin with Ukrainian officials. Rather, Biden generally pressured the Ukrainians to fire Shokin, according to reporting from multiple news outlets and Biden's own account of what happened. Trump's allies might argue that calling for the prosecutor's firing was even worse than calling for him to be taken off a particular case. But there is a key difference given the context. Had Biden called for Shokin to be taken off a particular matter in which his son had a stake, this would seem to suggest that his motivation was helping his son. But Biden calling for Shokin's firing, without mentioning that particular case, was consistent with the international concern about Shokin's performance.  Claim 3: Trump says Joe Biden previously said he spoke to Hunter Biden about Hunter's business dealings  Biden  said  Saturday, ""I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings."" Trump  responded  Sunday, ""He also said, long before, that he did speak to his son. So he lied, again.""  Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a  New Yorker article  in July. That article said this: ""As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: 'Dad said, ""I hope you know what you are doing,"" and I said, ""I do.'"" Once is more than never, so Trump can fairly point out the contradiction -- though the New Yorker article did not offer evidence that the father-son exchange was detailed. Regardless, the elder Biden was not contradicting himself; he was contradicting his son.  Claim 4: The amount of money at issue Trump has repeatedly  alleged  that Biden threatened to deny Ukraine ""billions of dollars."" According to Biden, it was a $1 billion loan guarantee. (Less than three months after Shokin was fired, Obama  agreed  to approve a $1 billion guarantee.) We don't have independent confirmation of what was discussed, so it's possible that Biden had also raised the subject of additional funds. One general caveat: it is possible that we'll generally learn more about Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine and about the firing of Shokin. But what we know right now shows significant factual problems with Trump's theories."
"David Webb, Donna Brazile and A.B. Stoddard on whether not Joe Biden will win the African-American vote. Former Vice President Joe Biden will need to rely on ""older"" African-American voters if he hopes to win the White House in 2020, according to A.B. Stoddard. “This age divide in the African-American electorate is the crux of Joe Biden’s viability,” Stoddard told  “The Daily Briefing”  with Dana Perino. “If he loses older African-Americans along with his non-college white support, he won’t be the nominee,” she said. The comments came after The New York Times ran a column titled,  “Young Black Voters to Their Biden-Supporting Parents: ‘Is This Your King?”  The piece looked at views of younger black voters, which in many case differ from theirs of their older counterparts. FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN AT NEW LOW IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE Stoddard said that the reason older African-Americans support the former vice president is that “they are afraid” and want to beat  President Trump . “They believe that the Obama presidency led to a flare-up of racism in this country, and President Donald Trump. They want to beat him,” she said. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS Stoddard went on to say that older black voters believe the new direction of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party -- its vow to decriminalize border crossings, take away private insurance and stand up for other “radical positions” -- is “out of step with the country.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden  has been considered the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination since before he even entered the race. However, while he currently still leads the field, his support has been diminishing, according to a new Fox News Poll. Biden has the support of 29 percent of Democratic primary voters, according to the poll. That figure is down from 31 percent in August and 35 percent in May. His current 11-point lead is down from a high of 19 points in June."
"Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy battles Don Lemon as a guest on his CNN show. Ruddy rips Lemon and the network's Ukraine coverage questioning Joe Biden’s involvement in the process. A guest on  CNN  slammed the network over its coverage of the Ukraine controversy and the latest impeachment developments by pointing to the ""counternarrative"" about  former Vice President Joe Biden  and the absence of anyone who supports  President Trump . Newsmax CEO and Trump confidant Chris Ruddy expressed his skepticism on Tuesday night about the hype surrounding the allegations being made about Trump and his communications with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""You thought that the Mueller thing should be investigated, the collusion thing- that took two years, $50 million,"" Ruddy told ""CNN Tonight"" anchor Don Lemon. ""I could tell you 12 headlines from CNN and other media that never came out to be true. And at the end of the day, there was no collusion."" ""It never said, 'no collusion,'"" Lemon asserted. ""It was very definitive, but my point is we are now three days into this and we already have an impeachment process underway,"" Ruddy continued. ""If the president committed a crime, I believe he should be impeached, but there's no evidence here yet that he committed any crime and I don't believe he did."" SCARAMUCCI DECLARES TRUMP IS 'DONE' AS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY TAKES FORM: 'ONLY A MATTER OF TIME NOW' The Trump ally repeatedly pressed Lemon on what crimes Trump allegedly violated, something the CNN anchor couldn't answer. ""Even if he was saying, 'I want an investigation of what happened in the 2016 election where they were clearly interfering, the Ukrainians, in that American election...  and an investigation of Joe Biden was also a role, what is illegal about that?"" Ruddy asked. ""It may be totally inappropriate... so you're now on the basis of hearsay or a discussion on this we're already under an impeachment process...  what federal law has he violated?"" MSNBC'S NICOLLE WALLACE: I DON'T REMEMBER REPUBLICANS WHO SUPPORT TRUMP AS 'GOOD PEOPLE ANYMORE Ruddy later pivoted to knock CNN's coverage of the Ukraine scandal. ""The Democrats in Washington are talking about impeaching [Trump] on basically hearsay... for the very thing Joe Biden did- he was trying to push out a prosecutor. You don't show that clip anytime,"" Ruddy told Lemon in reference to the 2018 video of Biden bragging about his involvement in pushing out a Ukrainian prosecutor by threatening to withhold foreign aid."" ""We're not here to talk about Joe Biden,"" Lemon responded, ""because none of that has been-"" ""You don't want to talk about anything that's a counternarrative,"" Ruddy shot back. The Newsmax CEO went on to suggest that the impeachment movement is occurring because people were ""unhappy"" with the results of the 2016 election, something Lemon rejected by saying ""that is a feeling, not a fact."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Even though the polling is showing that not the majority of the American people are not necessarily on the side of impeachment, you don't think that it is a good thing that lawmakers are doing what is right rather than doing what the polls are showing?"" Lemon asked. ""Because a lot of people who want this impeachment inquiry to happen are in Trump districts and may not get the votes that they want next time."" ""I think there's been a constant drumbeat like your coverage- CNN, not you personally,"" Ruddy responded. ""All night long, I didn't see really anyone that was supportive of the president's position. I may be the first person on all night."" ""No, there have been other people. You didn't see them,"" Lemon reacted. ""They're very rare and they're exceptions to the narrative,"" Ruddy continued. ""I think the American people are seeing it. They're ultimately going to be the judge of the impeachment process."""

"That call, which took place on July 25, one day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was also part of  a whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, the source added, a revelation that is likely to raise more questions in the ongoing controversy.  The Wall Street Journal  was first to report that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the July phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son Hunter, citing multiple people familiar with the matter.  The Journal also reported that Trump told Zelensky ""that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know"" whether allegations were true or not, one of the people said, according to the Journal.  Trump did not discuss a pending aid package to the country in the July 25 call, indicating that there may not have been an explicit quid pro quo outlined by the President in the conversation, the source familiar with the issue told CNN.  A readout of the call put out by the Ukrainian government says, ""Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA."" Joe Biden responded to the new revelations in a strongly-worded statement Friday.  ""If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump's willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation—a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia—pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor,"" Biden said.  ""Such clear-cut corruption damages and diminishes our institutions of government by making them tools of a personal political vendetta. At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress,"" he added. Trump downplays whistleblower's claims  Before the Journal's report was published, Trump downplayed the significance of the whistleblower complaint at the center of the latest controversy consuming Washington. During remarks in the Oval Office Friday, Trump claimed the whistleblower is partisan and his conversations with foreign leaders are ""appropriate."" But in a back-and-forth with reporters, Trump did not deny discussing Biden with Zelensky in that July phone call -- a potential subject for the complaint. ""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" Trump said prior to the Journal's report being published while appearing alongside the Australian Prime Minister, who he was hosting for a state visit. Precise details of the accusation aren't known, much to the chagrin of Democratic lawmakers, who have demanded more information. ""To ask a foreign leader to interfere in a presidential election - right after a year long investigation into potential foreign interference in a presidential election - would be pretty extraordinary. Even for these times,"" Connecticut Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy tweeted Friday in reaction to the news.   Trump admitted Friday he did not know the whistleblower's identity, and said he wasn't even sure if it was his conversation with Ukraine's leader that was the topic of the complaint. But he nevertheless appeared defensive about his interactions with Zelensky, with whom he will meet next week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Trump still pushing Biden claim Asked whether he'd discussed Biden with Ukraine's Zelensky during a phone call in late July, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed,"" but insisted that someone should look into Biden. ""It was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor's taken off the case,"" Trump said, appearing to refer to January remarks when Biden discussed his interactions with Ukraine's leadership when serving as vice president. Appearing  in a rambling interview on CNN on Thursday evening , Giuliani admitted he had discussed Biden with Ukraine's leaders during a visit to the country. Giuliani has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden's call in 2016 to remove the country's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company connected to Biden's son, Hunter. Other Western governments also called for that prosecutor's dismissal, and no evidence has indicated Biden's move was inappropriate. Ukraine's prosecutor general told Bloomberg in May he had no proof of wrongdoing by Biden or his son. Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian President has come under scrutiny from House investigators and they have demanded more information about Trump and Giuliani's interactions regarding Ukraine and the Biden matter, including calls for a transcript of Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president. Democrats are also looking for more information about the whistleblower's complaint. ""There's a real sense of urgency here since the Inspector General was so clear this is not something that can wait,"" said House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff on Friday, a day after his panel was briefed behind closed doors by the inspector general."
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks to reporters following Speaker Pelosi's announcement on a formal impeachment inquiry. The members of the progressive ""Squad"" amplified their  calls for impeachment  on Wednesday, rebuffing  President Trump's  attempts to quell concerns by releasing a transcript of his phone call with  Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelensky from July. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,  argued the transcript indicated the conversation was ""worse than we thought"" and accused the president of betraying the country. ""Folks, I am surprised the White House even released this transcript. It’s worse than we thought. The President sought to use the powers of the United States government to investigate a political opponent,"" she said. UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER -- BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID Ocasio-Cortez's comments came after  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,  announced she was opening an impeachment investigation -- something the Speaker had mostly resisted until details surfaced surrounding Trump's talk with Zelensky. ""Either the President does not know the weight of his words or he does not care about ethics or his constitutional responsibilities,"" she said in a statement Wednesday obtained by Fox News. “The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act."" The transcript, released on Wednesday, showed that Trump made no explicit mention of a quid pro quo exchanging U.S. foreign aid for an investigation into  former Vice President Joe Biden . Biden, the 2020 Democratic frontrunner, attracted scrutiny for successfully pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating a natural gas firm where his son Hunter served on the board of directors. As Ocasio-Cortez noted, the transcript was not a ""verbatim"" account but was based on ""notes and recollections"" of those observing the call. Fellow ""Squad"" member  Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn ., joined Ocasio-Cortez in calling for impeachment, arguing that the transcript alone was proof that Congress should pursue official proceedings. UKRAINE CALL WHISTLEBLOWER SHOWED 'POLITICAL BIAS,' FAVORED TRUMP'S 'RIVAL' CANDIDATE: MEMO Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.,  plainly accused Trump of trying to bribe and extort Zelensky but, in her tweet, didn't point to any particular portion of the transcript. The remaining ""Squad"" member, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., enthusiastically supported impeachment on Tuesday but didn't seem to comment on the released transcript via Twitter. HILLARY CLINTON ON UKRAINE CALL: TRUMP 'HAS BETRAYED OUR COUNTRY' By contrast, President Trump declared victory after the transcript's release. ""Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call - got them by surprise!"" he tweeted. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It seemed unlikely that Democrats would back away from impeachment since Pelosi announced the inquiry before the White House even released the transcript. Pelosi, on Tuesday, also claimed Trump's administration broke the law by suppressing a whistleblower's report on the call with Ukraine. Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report."
"The latest chapter in the most bizarre political saga in modern memory may very well lead to Trump's removal. Or it may not.  It may encourage Americans to follow the news more closely, it may prompt them to stay further away. It could derail Trump's re-election bid or provide his supporters with an energizing rallying cry. Certainly Trump's team is hoping for the latter, considering that Trump's 2020 campaign manager, Bradley Parscale, tweeted, ""Democrats have officially paved the way for a @realDonaldTrump landslide victory. The witch-hunt continues,"" which feels like a stretch considering Trump comfortably lost the popular vote and his Electoral College victory margin  ranked 46th of 58 US elections .  Regardless of Parscale's misplaced bravado, the real issue isn't what happens to Trump anyway. It's what happens to the nearly 63 million people who voted for him.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is correct: ""No one is above the law."" But for many who voted for Trump in the first place, this development isn't about the law, the Constitution or the sanctity of democracy. It is about winning. And if being willfully ignorant of Trump's alleged misdeeds helps Republicans win, they'll take it. This is why some of the same conservatives who greeted President Obama wearing a tan suit with hostility treat Trump allegedly withholding military aid in an attempt to pressure a foreign nation to investigate a political foe as no big deal. When the goal is to do what's best for the country, an impeachment inquiry is ideally a bipartisan effort to make sure the most powerful man in the world is not abusing his power. When the goal is to win, such an inquiry is viewed as an opponent that must be defeated.  We call it ""party over country,"" an environment Trump did not create but one he is clearly benefiting from. Given his recent admission that he discussed Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, I do believe impeachment is the proper action. I also believe because Trump is so disliked by a portion of America that many will make the mistake of conflating their feelings about him personally with the crimes he's accused of committing. And will enjoy a measure of satisfaction.  But it does not provide an exit off this debilitating national hamster wheel we're on. For be not mistaken, choosing party over patriotism is not an exclusively Republican affliction. There are countless Americans on both sides of the aisle who did not bother to read the Mueller report but will cherry-pick all their favorite quotes to support what they are already believe. You can't do what's best for the country when you're preoccupied with winning. Pelosi on Tuesday did the right thing for the country. But now, will she and the Democrats resist the temptation to do what's best for themselves?  Liberals may not care, but the nearly 63 million who voted for Trump will be watching ... and they're not going anywhere, even if Trump does. "
"The Deep State tried to use an illegitimate tool to throw up a smokescreen to distract the American people from President Trump's success, says former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. The Democratic media  narrative  of impeachment portrays President Trump and his administration as serial law-breakers who, true to form, obstruct all congressional investigations of wrongdoing. This then becomes the analytical framework for every new controversy. There are at least two fundamental problems with this. First, our constitutional system is based on friction between competing  branches  vested with separate but closely related powers. The framers understood that the two political branches would periodically try to usurp each other’s authorities. Congress often does this by enactments that seek to subject executive power to congressional (or judicial) supervision. Presidential pushback on such laws is not criminal obstruction; it is the Constitution in action. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Second, we’ve become so law-obsessed that we miss the forest for the trees. Often, the least important aspect of a controversy — viz., whether a law has been violated — becomes the dominant  consideration . Short shrift is given to the more consequential aspects, such as whether we are being competently governed or whether power is being abused. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP These problems are now playing out in the Trump controversy du jour (or should I say de l’heure?): the intelligence community whistleblower. As this column is written on Friday afternoon, the story is still evolving, with the president tweeting as ever, and The New York Times producing a report by no fewer than eight of its top journalists, joining the seven (and counting) who are working it for the Washington Post, which broke the story.

"Rep. Ilhan Omar defends past controversial 9/11 comments. Rep. Ilhan Omar , D-Minn., said she doesn't think former Vice President  Joe Biden  can be the progressive leader she believes the party needs heading into the  2020 presidential election , against  President Trump . Omar addressed her concerns about Biden in a new  interview  with The Guardian, after appearing at the  Iowa  People’s Presidential Forum on Saturday. She said the former vice president lacked the excitement necessary to inspire long-lasting change. ""There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country. And I would say he is not one of them,"" she said. IN RESURFACED INTERVIEW, ILHAN OMAR ANSWERS QUESTION ON 'JIHADIST TERRORISM' BY SAYING AMERICANS SHOULD BE 'MORE FEARFUL OF HIWTE MEN' ""I think it has been very clear to many of the people who have been creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations, that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have, and he doesn’t,"" Omar added. Omar is a member of the progressive ""squad"" -- along with Rep.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , N.Y., Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Rep.

"New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin said the move will result in Democrats hitting a ""dead end.""&nbsp; Wall Street Journal columnist  Kimberley Strassel  offered her analysis of the Trump- Ukraine  transcript on Twitter Wednesday, saying it was an ""internal attempt"" to oust the  president . ""Having read DOJ’s Trump-Ukraine release, here’s the real story: This is another internal attempt to take out a president, on the basis of another non-smoking-gun,"" she wrote. ""As to call transcript itself: Trump’s actual 'favor' is that Ukraine look backward, to what happened in the 2016 election. This is a legitimate ask, since election meddling looks to have come from both Russia and Ukraine.""

""Trump says 'good' and expresses worries that a 'good' prosecutor was 'shut down.' Mentions 'Biden’s son' and that Biden bragged he 'stopped the prosecution.' Ends that bit with 'It sounds horrible to me.'"" She also said the  Department of Justice  and Attorney General  Bill Barr  have yet to speak with Trump, or any Ukranian officials, directly about the matter and have released a statement to address the issue. ""And, never mind, because: DOJ in statement says the President has not spoken to AG about investigating Biden and has not asked the AG to contact the Ukraine. Also, Barr has not communicated with Ukraine—“on this or any subject,"" Strassel added.

"Dianna Muller tells Congress she will not comply with an assault-weapons ban. She encourages others to join the fight for Second Amendment rights. Former  police  officer Dianna Muller, fresh off her explosive testimony to the  House Judiciary Committee hearing  on assault weapons, said Thursday that gun owners need to “get involved and engaged” because the Second Amendment is at stake. “What we’re up against is a very well-organized, well-funded effort to take guns away from American citizens,” the former Tulsa, Okla., officer and founder of gun advocacy group The DC Project told  “Fox & Friends ."" “If you are a gun owner and you feel like you’re under attack, you need to call your congressmen and, you know, it sounds cliche, but it's more important now than ever,” Muller said, adding she has drawn a ""line in the sand."" Muller made a bold proclamation during the congressional hearing regarding a proposed assault weapons ban, vowing that she would not comply. KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE SUPPORTS A MANDATORY BUYBACK ON 'ASSAULT WEAPONS' The session on an otherwise contentious issue flew largely under the radar amid the Trump-Ukraine controversy and the Democrats' impeachment push. Amid a spate of deadly mass shootings that prompted renewed calls for strict laws on assault weapons, Muller said, such a ban would force lawful gun owners to either give up their arms or become criminals. Muller said that there are many law enforcement officers who agree with her, and that opponents are using terms such as “weapons of war” to incite emotion. “More people are killed with hammers and blunt objects than all rifles combined according to FBI statistics so it doesn’t make sense to me that this is going to solve the problem,” Muller said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The gun control push  from Democrats was evident at a recent presidential debate, where candidate Beto O'Rourke, a former congressman from Texas, generated a huge round of applause by vowing to use a mandatory gun buyback program to take assault weapons from Americans. Meantime, the White House has been in negotiations with lawmakers on measures like increased background checks. Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley  told Fox News  last week that he expected an announcement on new gun legislation “very soon.” Gidley said President Trump wanted to make sure that any new laws would address actual problems and not just be “feel-good legislation.” Fox News’ Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report."
"And yet, we are hearing a lot of meowing of protest from the field. Candidates have said they are being forced  to adjust  their campaign strategies away from winning votes to meet these benchmarks; party insiders are saying the benchmarks  are excluding  highly credentialed voices in favor of celebrity candidates; and down-ballot Democrats are  complaining  the donor threshold is taking much-needed money away from their races. But first, let's be clear that  Democratic primary voters  want to  narrow the field.  Generally speaking, a larger and more fractured field tends to benefit some front-runners (Joe Biden) while  disadvantaging others  (Elizabeth Warren). And, of course, no candidate left off the stage is going to praise a system that torpedoed his campaign, but even those candidates know they can't get their message across with 24 people on the stage. This is all to say, there is no solution to make everyone happy.  The Republican National Committee experienced much the same problem in 2016 and some of us would argue blew it in far more epic fashion. (Full disclosure: I worked for Carly Fiorina during 2016 and was watching the March debate from my hotel room as a handful of dudes  tossed around not-so-veiled references  to the size of their  penises .) My point being that we should at least give the DNC credit for trying to trim the fat with a scalpel instead of the RNC's machete that arbitrarily set and reset qualifications each month based solely on poll numbers.    Even so, I am not the first to point out that there's something  wrong here . Polling and fundraising don't measure whether someone will be a good president -- or even a good candidate. And incentivizing your candidates to spend money to meet those thresholds doesn't move the ball down the field for the party or the eventual nominee. And of course, there's the absurdity of putting that much stock in national name recognition whereby the only way for your candidate to get exposure to tens of millions of viewers during the debate is to have high national poll numbers, which more often than not are simply a  reflection of name recognition  among voters who have already been exposed to that candidate. Captain Yossarian would be proud. It's almost as if you'd be better off if you'd starred on a hit reality TV show for years instead of served as a governor or run a Fortune 50 company.  Defenders of the system, though, would say it's working. We started with 20 debaters, and by November, we may be  down to eight .   But here's the problem. If we had whittled the field too quickly in 1991, there would have been no President Clinton. By July of 1991, he had a  polling average  of only 1.7% -- in a tie for 13th place with Jay Rockefeller. As Nate Silver  has pointed out , in two of the past nine cycles, the eventual Democratic nominee was not even in the top 10 by July -- and both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton went on to win the presidency the next year.  So here's an alternative I'm proposing to the DNC:  The top three polling candidates according to an average of qualifying national polls get an automatic ticket to the stage. In the end, this is still our closest approximation to votes. But why should this be coupled with fundraising? If you're a great, progressive candidate who has managed to capture the support of 20% of your party's supporters without creating an enormous money machine, you have perhaps all the more reason to be on that stage.   Any candidate with a million individual donors gets a ticket. The goal of this metric isn't to reward a big fundraising haul but to measure support that may not be showing up in the polls. The threshold, therefore, must be meaningful and high. Bernie Sanders is the  only candidate  to hit this number so far. But by way of example, if Sanders were polling at only 2% nationwide, would the DNC really want to exclude a guy with a million high-enthusiasm Democratic voters who presumably has a uniquely powerful message that is resonating with those who have heard it?  Any candidate with more than 15% support when the same polling averages are weighted for name recognition would be on the stage. Silver has a nice chart on adjusted polling averages  here . But in short, if two candidates both have 5% in the latest poll but Candidate A's names is familiar to 80% of voters and Candidate B is known by only 30% of voters, we would assume Candidate B would poll higher than Candidate A if all voters knew who both of them were. So you would ""weight"" that poll by multiplying their support as if they had the same name recognition as the most well-known candidate ( Biden ). Suddenly, Candidate B would have a weighted polling average just over 15%. Side note: It boggles my mind why this hasn't already happened. If voters haven't heard your message because you're, let's say, the governor of Montana without a lot of national airtime, why would the party want to limit your only chance to reach a broader audience with how you've succeeded in implementing progressive policies? And on the flip side, if you are a celebrity politician with near-universal name recognition among voters but only 4% support in a poll, do we really need to hear more? These rules would have ensured Clinton made the stage in 1991. Ironically, it also would have excluded Biden  in 2007  (along with Dennis Kucinich, Wesley Clark and Chris Dodd, among others).    And what of 2020? Of course, it's impossible to say for sure because the candidates would have run their campaigns differently if the DNC rules had been, well, different. Like those who talk about the popular vote versus the Electoral College, you can't rerun the game with different rules and assume the same inputs. But as of July, the field would have been narrowed to Biden, Sanders, Kamala Harris, Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke. And given how close Cory Booker and Andrew Yang would have been to the cutoff, it seems fair to assume they would have tweaked their strategies to get to an adjusted 5% as well.  Funny enough, it's the same eight who will probably be on the stage come November. But it sure sounds a lot fairer, doesn't it?"
"Dr. Marc Siegel weighs in on 2020 Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders' health care plan. Sen. Bernie Sanders  on Tuesday unveiled a massive tax on the wealthiest Americans that aims to diminish income inequality -- a central theme of his campaign -- and at least begin to finance the steep price tags for the numerous government programs the Democratic presidential candidate is proposing. The release of the  independent senator from Vermont's  ‘Tax on Extreme Wealth’ follows a similar plan from one of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, fellow progressive and populist lawmaker  Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. “There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people,” Sanders said on Twitter as he urged supporters to read his new plan. His campaign also sent an email under the subject line: ""Billionaires should not exist."" THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN In his decades in Congress and during both of his runs for the White House, Sanders has railed against an American economic system that he says favors corporations and the rich, at the expense of the working class. Sanders' plan , if enacted into law, would place a 1 percent tax on net worth over $32 million, a 2 percent tax on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, and a 3 percent tax on net worth between $250 million and $500 million. The proposed Sanders tax would increase to 4 percent net worth from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent for net worth from $1 billion to $2.5 billion, and ultimately reach 8 percent for wealth over $10 billion. The Sanders campaign says their plan would impact approximately 180,000 households nationwide, and would raise about $4.35 trillion in government revenue by the 2028 budget year. “Our tax on extreme wealth would only apply to the wealthiest households in America and would cut the wealth of billionaires in half over 15 years, which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small, privileged class,” Sanders said in an email to supporters announcing his plan. And he said that he would “use the revenue to fund our affordable housing plan, universal childcare, and help fund our work to guarantee health care as a right for every man, woman, and child in this country."" The Republican National Committee criticized Sanders, with spokesman Michael Joyce arguing that “no matter how many new taxes Bernie proposes, it still won’t come even close to covering the costs of Bernie’s socialist pie-in-the-sky policy proposals.” Warren’s plan – which she unveiled at the beginning of the year-- by comparison would place a 2 percent annual tax on net worth above $50 million and would slap a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion. Her campaign says it would affect the top 70,000 households in the county and would bring in an estimated $2.6 trillion over 10 years. Sanders, in order “ensure that the wealthy are not able to evade the tax,” is calling for creating a national registry and beefing up third-party reporting requirements, increasing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and requiring the IRS to perform audits of 30 percent of those in the 1 percent bracket and audits of all billionaires.  He’s also calling for a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and a steeper 60 percent on assets over $1 billion “for all wealthy individuals seeking to expatriate to avoid the tax.” President Trump’s re-election campaign took aim at Sanders, not specifically over his new plan but for vows by the senator and the rest of the Democratic field to repeal the tax cuts passed in 2017 by the then-GOP controlled Congress and signed into law by the president. “By repealing President Trump’s tax cuts, Sanders and the rest of the Democrats would raise taxes on almost all Americans, not just the very rich,” campaign spokesperson Erin Perrine said.

"2020 Republican presidential hopeful Bill Weld says he is not 'in love' with the job being done in Washington. Mark Levin  ripped  2020 Republican presidential candidate   William Weld  for claiming  President Trump  committed treason and suggesting he, therefore, face the death penalty over the  Ukraine controversy . Weld, a former Massachusetts governor and U.S. attorney in the Bay State, should be lambasted by all Americans for those comments, Levin said Monday on "" The Mark Levin Show on Westwood One ."" ""This should be an absolute controversy that William Weld just accused the president of treason – pure and simple – and then said the only penalty is 'death',"" he said. ""I worked with Bill Weld. Bill Weld is a conniving, unethical [person],"" Levin added, recalling the two men's time working in the Reagan Justice Department. Levin was chief of staff to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese and Weld was the head of the Criminal Division. BILL WELD SUGGESTS TRUMP COULD FACE EXECUTION OVER UKRAINE PHONE CALL Levin told his audience how Weld, then-Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns, and other top aides resigned, amid what he characterized as  an attempt to urge Reagan to fire Meese . ""And they failed... And he did all this to position himself to run for governor of Massachusetts. He's doing a similar thing against President Trump. The man is utterly unprincipled. And I'll prove it to you,"" he said playing a clip from Weld's appearance on MSNBC. On the network's ""Morning Joe"" program,  Weld claimed Trump  has ""now acknowledged that, in a single phone call right after he suspended $250 million of military aid to Ukraine, he called up the president of Ukraine and pressed him eight times to investigate Joe Biden."" ""Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election. It couldn’t be clearer, and that’s not just undermining democratic institutions. That is treason. It’s treason, pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death. That’s the only penalty."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Weld continued , remarking it could be a ""pretty good alternative"" for Trump to offer a ""plea"" for the Constitutional remedy instead: removal from office.

""He doesn't have a chance in Hell of getting one percent of the vote... This man wants to be president of the United States. He doesn't even qualify to be a host on MSNBC or CNN.""

"‘The View’ hosts praised Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi after her floor speech denouncing Trump’s controversial comments regarding four congresswomen. ""The View""  co-host Sunny Hostin, who has long  pushed for President Trump's impeachment , predicted on Wednesday that  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , would effectively unify the country by holding official proceedings. ""I think the impeachment hearings will unify the country,"" Hostin said, prompting agreement from co-host  Joy Behar . Co-host Abby Huntsman had argued that impeachment would further polarize the country. ""If you think this country is divided right now, if you think that politically we're in a bad place, you wait until we have impeachment hearings. It's going to get far worse,"" she said.

"The party's inexorable tug to the left could push suburban women and others to the Republican camp, says Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary. Former  White House  Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Monday that moderate  Democrats  have to “distance themselves” from the more  progressive  wing of their party. “When you’re in the primary... the tug to the left is inexorable and it just pulls them all, including now Biden who is running to the left,” Fleischer told  “The Daily Briefing” with Dana Perino. The comments came after  Rep. Ilhan Omar , D-Minn., said she doesn't think former Vice President  Joe Biden  can be the progressive leader she believes the party needs heading into the  2020 presidential election , against  President Trump . ILHAN OMAR REFUSES TO BACK BIDEN, SAYS FORMER VICE PRESIDENT ISN'T RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD DEMS IN 2020 Omar addressed her concerns about Biden in a new interview with The Guardian, after appearing at the Iowa People’s Presidential Forum on Saturday. She said the former vice president lacked the excitement necessary to inspire long-lasting change. ""There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country. And I would say he is not one of them,"" she said. IN RESURFACED INTERVIEW, ILHAN OMAR ANSWERS QUESTION ON 'JIHADIST TERRORISM' BY SAYING AMERICANS SHOULD BE 'MORE FEARFUL OF WHITE MEN' “Because of Trump, no one is noticing how far to the left the Democratic Party is going and it’s just accelerated, even more as we approach 2020.” Fleischer said that the number of Democrats who identify as liberal has surged inside the party but the growing efforts to appeal to those voters creates a risk of potentially turning suburban women and others to the Republican camp.

"  Trump spoke of a  letter  that three Democratic senators wrote in 2018 to Ukraine's prosecutor general, claiming, ""In the letter they implied that their support for US assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn't do the right thing they wouldn't get any assistance. Gee, doesn't that sound familiar?""   He accused Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of having ""literally threatened"" Zelensky during a recent trip to Ukraine, alleging that Murphy said ""that if he doesn't do things right they won't have Democratic support in Congress.""   Later in the press conference, Trump said: ""I just told you about senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things. That's really what people are trying to say that I did. But the only difference is I didn't do it...There was no quid pro quo. But there was with Biden and there was with these senators. And they threatened -- they said, 'You do this, you do that. We're not going to give you votes.' That's the real deal.""    We fact checked Trump's claims about Biden and Ukraine  here . This time, let's start with the letter.   A request, not a threat Facts First:   The 2018 letter  from Sens. Patrick Leahy, Dick Durbin and Bob Menendez did not include any threat at all, about US assistance to Ukraine or anything else; it did not even mention US assistance.   Rather, it expressed concern about  a New York Times article  that said Ukraine had -- with the aim of avoiding Trump's anger -- stopped cooperating with the Robert Mueller investigation and frozen investigations into the Ukraine-related activities of Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman.  It urged Ukraine to ""reverse course"" if the Times story was accurate.   Manafort, a longtime lobbyist, had worked as an adviser to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych,  receiving millions of dollars for his work . He was subsequently convicted of multiple financial crimes related to payments he received from Ukraine, which he laundered to avoid paying taxes.   It is difficult to conclusively fact check Trump's claim that the Democrats' letter ""implied"" that assistance to Ukraine was at stake; different people read between the lines differently. But the plain language of the senators' letter does not appear to even hint at withdrawing aid to Ukraine, and the senators say they were not doing so.   ""The Senators' letter was written in response to a New York Times report that the Ukrainian Prosecutor General was considering not cooperating with the Mueller Probe out of concern that President Trump would cut off aid as punishment. The Senators' letter in no way calls for the conditioning of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine,"" the senators said in a joint statement on Wednesday.   The letter was written while Petro Poroshenko was president of Ukraine. It said the senators were ""disappointed"" that ""some in Kiev"" appeared to have cast aside principles of their shared relationship like ""respect for the rule of law and accountable democratic institutions"" in an attempt to ""avoid the ire of President Trump.""   ""If these reports are true, we strongly encourage you to reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation,"" the letter said.   The letter concluded with three questions to Ukraine's prosecutor general. It asked whether his office had indeed taken steps to stop cooperating with Mueller, whether anyone acting for the Trump administration had asked Ukraine to do so, and whether the Mueller probe had been raised during previous bilateral meetings between the two countries.   Urging an investigation? Trump was not the only prominent Republican to wrongly describe the letter.  In a tweet  earlier on Wednesday, Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said, ""In 2018, Democrat Senators wrote a letter to Ukraine, urging them to investigate @realDonaldTrump.""    On Thursday morning,  Trump retweeted  a tweet from his son Donald Trump Jr. that amplified another Twitter user's claim that the Democrats' letter had asked Ukraine to ""investigate Trump.""    Facts First:   The letter did not call for any investigating of Trump. Again, the senators urged the prosecutor not to stop existing investigations and not to stop cooperating with Mueller because they were worried about Trump's reaction, and they asked if the Trump administration had encouraged Ukraine to stop cooperating.   The claim about Murphy We don't know exactly what Murphy said to Zelensky during their meeting three weeks ago, which Murphy said was attended by Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, so we can't call Trump's claim true or false.   Murphy said on Twitter  that his comments to Zelensky had been unobjectionable.   ""I told Zelensky that he should not take orders from Trump's campaign and that his credibility would be greatly compromised if he interfered in the 2020 election. That's common sense, and I stand by what I said. 100%,"" he said.   Murphy also said in a written statement that he had also told Zelensky ""that his government should communicate with the State Department, not the president's campaign."""

"Pelosi announces plans to go forward; Mike Emanuel has the details. Most of the 2020  Democratic presidential candidates  applauded  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry into  President Trump  Tuesday evening. Pelosi made the announcement following a meeting of the House Democratic Caucus at the Capitol, saying that ""the president must be held accountable"" for what she called the ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections."" The only Democratic hopeful to explicitly come out against impeachment was  Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , D-Hawaii. Speaking on Fox Business'  “Kennedy”  on Tuesday night Gabbard said she thinks impeachment would be very ""divisive"" for a country that is already divided. PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP “Donald Trump has abused his power, obstructed justice, and violated his oath of office. He puts his political interests over our national interest,” tweeted  Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.  “I agree with @SpeakerPelosi— no one is above the law. He must be impeached.” Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. , who first called for impeachment proceedings to begin in May after  Special Counsel Robert Mueller  spoke publicly about the findings of his  Russia investigation , tweeted on Tuesday evening, “In 2016, Trump welcomed foreign adversaries to meddle in our democracy for his own gain. Now he appears to be using the same playbook to remain in power.""  Mueller’s probe was intended to examine Russian election interference and whether President Trump's campaign colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 election. In the report, Mueller said he could not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice but that investigators did not find sufficient evidence to establish charges of criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign. Booker added, ""I applaud Speaker Pelosi's announcement of an impeachment inquiry—it’s our one remaining path to ensuring justice is served.” Pelosi specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over an intelligence community whistleblower's complaint concerning a July phone call with Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky .  Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence is blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal."" GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN Trump allegedly pushed Zelensky to  investigate  former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The president  vowed earlier Tuesday  to release a ""complete"" transcript of his call with  Zelensky  on Wednesday, though it's unlikely to settle the issue in Congress. Joe Biden  has acknowledged  that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm  Burisma Holdings  — where Hunter Biden was on the board. ""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said Tuesday. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.” Following Pelosi’s announcement, Biden tweeted, “Pressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent — to help win an election — is not the conduct of an American President.” Earlier Tuesday, Biden called Trump’s alleged actions “an abuse of power.” “They undermine our national security,” Biden tweeted. “They violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.” In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the Ukraine aid money to an investigation of the Bidens.  “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But, he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” acknowledged that Biden had come up during the call and added: ""It's very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?"" Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt.,  did not immediately release a statement, but sent out a somewhat-cryptic tweet Tuesday night, writing only: ""Billionaires should not be able to control our political system."" During a press conference earlier on Tuesday Sanders said, “If you're going to go forward with impeachment. You're going to have grounds to do it. I happen to believe they're authorized to do it, but you got to lay it out.” In a statement, former Texas rep.  Beto O’Rourke  said he is “grateful to Speaker Pelosi for opening an impeachment inquiry into President Trump” and called her announcement “a defining moment for our country.” “For more than two years, even as I was running for Senate in  Texas , I have been clear that I support impeachment,” O’Rourke said. “We all must come to terms with what we face: a lawless president who has obstructed justice and undermined our democracy by inviting a foreign power to intervene in 2016, and who is doing it again in 2020.” Entrepreneur  Andrew Yang  tweeted on Tuesday, “Given the President’s latest actions I think impeachment is the right path forward.” Yang added: “Asking foreign leaders for political help in return for aid and then suppressing your own agency’s inquiry is egregious. There have to be limits and Congress is right to act.” In a follow-up tweet, Yang wrote, “A reminder that successful impeachment requires a majority vote in the House and then two-thirds in the Senate. Given that there are 53 Republican Senators one would need 20 of them to support impeachment to be successful. That is highly unlikely unless there is some huge shift.”  He added that he still agrees that moving forward “is for the best,” saying it will allow for a more thorough investigation “that may unearth new details.”  Sen. Amy Klobuchar,  D-Minn., tweeted simply, “The House did the right thing.” Former Maryland Congressman  John Delaney  released a statement following the announcement saying he agreed with Pelosi’s decision to move forward with an official impeachment inquiry, adding that “she deserves our support.”  ""The President’s behavior, combined with the administration’s refusal to cooperate, leaves her no other choice,"" Delaney added. ""Our nation can only be as strong as the rules that govern it.”  Sen.  Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., called Pelosi's announcement ""an overdue but important step.” ""Now the impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands,"" she said. ""The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires.” Billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer said he applauded Pelosi and Democrats in Congress who are calling for an investigation into Trump’s alleged criminal behavior. “Removing Trump from office has always been about doing what’s right, not what’s politically convenient,” Steyer said. “We built a nationwide movement to impeach a lawless president and defend our democracy. This is just the beginning.” Earlier this month,  Steyer  told Fox News'  Bret Baier  during an interview on  “Special Report”  that he thinks President Trump is “the most corrupt president in American history” and that he has “more than met the criteria for impeachment.” Pete Buttigieg , the mayor of South Bend, Ind., did not react on social media, but in an interview on CNN on Tuesday night said the announcement is “a moment of truth for the country,” adding that “sooner or later it had to come.”  He went on to say that the announcement is also “a moment of truth for the Republican Party."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A total of 172 House Democrats have now signaled support for an impeachment inquiry. A simple majority of House members present and voting would be required to impeach the president. A highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove Trump from office. Vice President Mike Pence would then take office in that scenario and become the 46th President of the United States. Fox News’ Gregg Re contributed to this report. "
"""We are seeing both in real time, with the President's remarks and also through documentary evidence, his corruption,"" Bernstein told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Thursday. The complaint, released on Thursday, alleges that Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Bernstein pointed to  Trump's subsequent comments on how spies were dealt with differently in the old days  in referencing who provided key information to the whistleblower as a display of ""his temperament in an extreme, perhaps even greater than we've ever seen before."" ""We're watching, too, an unraveling in front of us, both factually and also temperamentally, in terms of the conduct of the President of the United States,"" Bernstein said.  ""And why?"" he added. ""Well, partly because the President of the United States recognizes that there is in this whistleblower's documents terrible evidence of the President's corruption."" The complaint has been at the center of a controversy that has  spurred Democrats  to launch a formal  impeachment  inquiry. The White House on Wednesday also released a  rough transcript  of a July 25 call showing that Trump pressed Ukraine to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Bernstein argued that the complaint showed Trump's ""willingness to undermine the free electoral system in this country, to involve foreign powers in our election, and also to try and get (the attorney general) involved."" When asked whether the complaint was similar to the tapes of recorded White House conversations central to President Richard Nixon's impeachment inquiry, Bernstein said that ""there are definitely some parallels here."" ""These are clearly documents that the President doesn't want exposed, and which according to the whistleblower and other witnesses, demonstrate the President's cover up as well as his actions, per se, in these Ukraine phone calls,"" he added."
"Juan Williams backs Biden's claim about Trump, Ukraine story President Trump  is attacking former  Vice President Joe Biden  over his son Hunter's involvement with a Ukrainian energy firm because recent polls show him  defeating the president head-to-head , according to Juan Williams. The reports Trump  continues to discuss  -- surrounding allegations of unsubstantiated wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter related to dealings with Kiev -- are not new, but the president would like to tar the former vice president by whatever means necessary, Williams claimed Monday on "" The Five ."" ""This is not new about Hunter Biden and his dad,"" he said. ""The whole thing is just, Trump has a style, which is he goes on the offensive when he's under attack."" TRUMP SLAMS MEDIA AS 'CROOKED AS HELL' AMID UKRAINE PHONE CALL CONTROVERSY The president’s heated comments have come as congressional Democrats are pressing for a full disclosure of the whistleblower's complaint. Trump acknowledged Monday he didn't want to give money to Ukraine if there were corruption issues. His comments raised further questions about whether he improperly used his office to pressure the country into investigating the former vice president and his family. Hunter Biden  worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son. On "" The Five ,"" Williams backed the elder Biden's claim Trump is highlighting Hunter Biden's relationship to the natural gas company because he wants to fend off a potential general election challenge. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""I think Joe Biden is right,"" he said. ""Joe Biden sees that he is the target of Trump's ire because Trump sees -- as every poll indicates -- that Biden could 'beat him like a drum'."" Earlier, Biden used the description in his own critique of the president. ""Trump's doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum,"" he told reporters in Iowa over the weekend. ""And, he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to do something to smear me."" The whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he  privately threatened then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko  that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired. “I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion,'""  Biden recounted telling Poroshenko  at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here, in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'"" “Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. Fox News' Gregg Re and Andrew O'Reilly contributed to this report."
"Trump addresses reporters as he arrives at the United Nations, says 'what Biden did was wrong.' The Trump administration pushed back Tuesday in the wake of multiple reports that the White House froze millions in aid to Ukraine shortly before President Trump pressured the country's leader to  investigate  Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The reports coincided with a renewed round of calls,  including from more centrist Democrats, for a formal impeachment inquiry. Those calls came a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she is opening the door to that route if the administration continues to withhold a whistleblower complaint apparently related to  Trump's Ukraine  discussions. FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AMID BOMBSHELL REPORTS TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE AID Multiple administration sources confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that the Office of Management and Budget indeed told the State Department and Department of Defense in July that it was putting a hold on nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. But administration sources told Fox News that the reason for the freeze on Ukrainian aid was tied to concerns about corruption. Sources said that Trump wanted to be confident that the incoming administration of Volodymyr Zelensky was going to take steps to end corruption before releasing the funding. The aid to Ukraine also, according to sources, came up in the context of other countries and questions about whether they were paying their share. Trump, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly later Tuesday, insisted he only sought to hold up the Ukraine aid because he “wanted other countries to pay.” “There was no quid pro quo,” he said. “There was no pressure applied, nothing.” The White House’s decision to release the funding ultimately was made in mid-August, after Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, called the president and said that Ukraine desperately needed the aid, according to administration sources. The White House, at the time, was also up against an appropriation “impoundment” deadline, which meant the money would either have to be spent, or impounded. The White House would have been forced to go to court to justify the impoundment, which sources said it did not want to do. The White House, though, has denied the allegations that the freezing of the Ukrainian aid was tied to allegations that the president asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. “The media pushed the Russia lie for almost three years with no evidence, and now they are doing it all over again,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News. “These allegations are completely false, but because the media wants this story to be true so badly, they’ll once again manufacture a frenzy and drive ignorant, fake stories to attack this President.” In remarks to reporters at the United Nations Monday, Trump also denied linking the aid money to Ukraine’s investigative actions. “No, I didn’t—I didn’t do it,” Trump said, also calling the Biden’s actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” and adding: “It’s very important to talk about corruption…Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?” But Democrats are concerned the president may have essentially withheld money to Ukraine as leverage to seek an investigation concerning the Bidens -- which is now prompting renewed impeachment calls. The furor began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week that involved allegations that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Zelensky. A person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have “firsthand knowledge” of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, but Democrats want to see the complaint. SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL Joe Biden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump and his allies have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate's role. Nevertheless, Democrats have used the reports and new allegations against the president to press forward—even as it risks backfiring by exposing potential wrongdoing by Biden. Late Monday night, a slew of key swing-district Democrats publicly offered their support for opening a formal impeachment inquiry. Seven centrist Democratic freshmen lawmakers who served in the military and national security announced in an op-ed in The Washington Post that if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens for political benefit, it’s impeachable. The lawmakers included Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. The Democrats wrote in The Washington Post they ""do not arrive at this conclusion lightly."" “These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent,"" the lawmakers said. “These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do.” Also, later Monday night, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz and Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell endorsed an impeachment inquiry. Such an inquiry would not be an impeachment vote, but rather an investigative process that could lead to actual impeachment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There are now 154 House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with  one independent  -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. An unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president.) Fox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report. "
"As a result, we now have facts quite distinct from any that have come out about this President before -- and the strongest, or at least most easily explainable, case for impeachment to date. The allegations at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election concerned Trump's conduct while he was a candidate for office. There is good authority from the founding era that an effort to corrupt the electoral process ahead of an election might be impeachable. For example, at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, both George Mason and Gouverneur Morris  observed  that a president who ""procured his appointment"" by corrupting the electors must be impeachable.  But since impeachment is at its core about a president's misuse of office or suitability to hold it, pre-inauguration conduct at least raises a tricky question. Whatever happened with the Russians during the 2016 election, Trump wasn't then in a position to use the organs of the American state to encourage foreign interference.   Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, on the other hand, happened after Trump became President and had sworn an  oath  to faithfully execute his office and ""preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.""   With Russia, the most that can be said is that Trump expressed a willingness to receive political help from a hostile foreign power. Mueller could not prove there had been  direct contact  between the Trump campaign and Russian officials to coordinate that help. It remains troubling, if not impeachable, that the help was nonetheless delivered in the form of leaks and a social media misinformation campaign aimed at Trump's opponent.   There are three key differences between the Russian and Ukrainian situations that should affect the impeachment debate.   One:  This week, it has been revealed that Trump personally spoke with a foreign head of state and directly asked for a foreign government to probe for negative information about a possible presidential opponent. In other words, Trump's call with President Zelensky may well constitute the very thing Trump denied throughout the Mueller investigation: ""colluding"" with a foreign power for personal electoral advantage.   Two:  The fact that Ukraine is not a powerful traditional adversary, like Russia, makes the case worse in several ways. It means that Trump was not asking a geopolitical equal for help; he was demanding help from a  weakened country  situated on the border of an increasingly aggressive Russia; a country part of whose territory has already been illegally annexed by Russia, and whose continued survival as an independent nation depends on military, economic and diplomatic support from the United States and its European allies in NATO. How can the request of ""a favor"" from the American President to such a country be understood as anything but an  extortionate demand?   Three:  Ever since the British invented impeachment in the 1300s, abuse of official power for personal gain has been on the short list of undeniably impeachable offenses in Great Britain and the United States. The second article of impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee against President Richard Nixon charged him with abuse of power. Nixon misused his domestic authority as President to get dirt on his political foes, and then used the powers of the federal government to try to cover it up.    But Nixon's conduct was penny-ante compared to Trump's. Trump didn't cover up a second-rate burglary by a group of inept ""plumbers"" looking for dirt on Democrats. Rather, he appears to have wielded the entire economic, military and moral authority of a great nation to, effectively, extort another democratically elected head of state.   Leaving aside the question of impeachment, this episode must count as one of the most discreditable things any American President has ever done. Prior Presidents have been cruel or mean-spirited, bigoted or shortsighted, and sometimes exercised terrible judgment. And every President makes decisions with at least one eye on the political consequences. But I know of no comparable case where a President baldly, consciously misused the power of the whole nation for his own purely private political benefit, without even a credible claim that it was in the national interest.    If what Trump did here isn't impeachable, nothing is."
"But in a back-and-forth with reporters, he did not deny discussing former Vice President Joe Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call -- a potential subject for the complaint.  And he admitted he did not know the whistleblower's identity, despite his accusation of partisanship. It was a robust self-defense against accusations that remain, for now, veiled in mystery. An intelligence watchdog has said the claims are ""urgent"" and ""serious,"" but the acting top intelligence official has declined to provide them to Congress. Trump dismissed them as another attempt to bring down his presidency. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump called the story ""ridiculous"" and described the whistleblower as ""just another political hack job.""  ""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" Trump said alongside his Australian counterpart, who he was hosting for a state visit. Asked whether he'd discussed Biden with Ukraine's Zelensky during a phone call in late July, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed,"" but insisted that someone should look into Biden. ""It was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor's taken off the case,"" Trump said, appearing to refer to January remarks when Biden discussed his interactions with Ukraine's leadership when serving as vice president. ""The fake news,"" Trump claimed,""doesn't look into things like that."" Trump's remarks came a day after the New York Times and Washington Post reported that an intelligence whistleblower had submitted a complaint related to Trump's interactions on Ukraine. Precise details of the accusation aren't known, much to the chagrin of Democratic lawmakers, who have demanded more information. Trump admitted Friday he did not know the whistleblower's identity, and said he wasn't even sure if it was his conversation with Ukraine's leader that was the topic of the complaint. But he nevertheless appeared defensive about his interactions with Zelensky, whom he will meet next week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Appearing in a rambling interview on CNN on Thursday evening, the President's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani admitted he himself had discussed Biden with Ukraine's leaders during a visit to the country. That conversation has come under scrutiny from House investigators, who have demanded more information about Trump and Giuliani's interactions regarding Ukraine and the Biden matter. That includes a transcript of Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president. Democrats are also looking for more information about the whistleblower's complaint. ""There's a real sense of urgency here since the Inspector General was so clear this is not something that can wait,"" said House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff on Friday, a day after his panel was briefed behind closed doors by the inspector general."
"House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff gives opening remarks during a Capitol Hill hearing on the whistleblower complaint. House Intelligence Committee Chairman  Adam Schiff , D-Calif., came under fire on Thursday for reading his own ""parody"" version of President Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky without noting he'd made it all up. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was on Capitol Hill to defend his handling of the explosive whistleblower complaint alleging President Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate the Biden family. INTEL CHIEF MAGUIRE DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, CALLS ISSUE ‘UNPRECEDENTED’ The complaint contains allegations related to Trump’s call with Zelensky in July, when he urged him to investigate alleged corruption involving former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The White House on Wednesday released an unclassified version of the transcript of the phone call. The memo, which does not reflect a “verbatim transcript” but is based on “notes and recollections” of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of the Bidens, seeking an investigation of some kind. However, Schiff’s improvised version of the call was exaggerated, apparently for dramatic effect. READ THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT “I have a favor I want from you,” Schiff said while appearing to read from a paper. “And I’m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.” Schiff later chalked his fictional summary of the controversial phone call to a joke. “My summary of the president’s call was meant to be at least, part, in parody. The fact that that’s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself. Of course, the president never said, ‘If you don’t understand me I’m going to say it seven more times,’ my point is, that’s the message that the Ukraine president was receiving in not so many words,” Schiff said. “In opening statement, Rep. Schiff makes up dialogue to represent what Trump said to Zelensky. A rough transcript of the president's words exists, and is available, but Schiff's version is more dramatic,” Fox News contributor Byron York tweeted. MEDIA 'MOVE THE GOALPOSTS' AFTER RELEASE OF TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT Conservative commentator  Matt Walsh wrote  that Schiff “knows that a lot of people watching will think that's actually what the transcript said” when it was pure fiction. “In fact, the WHOLE POINT is that the transcript DOESN'T say what Schiff just said it said,” Walsh said. Elise Stefanik, R-NY., later mocked the situation when it was her turn to grill Maguire “I’m not going to improvise for parody purposes like the chairman of this committee did,” Stefanik said when reading the complaint. “I’m going to quote it directly.” Stefanik also took to Twitter, calling the situation ""disturbing and outrageous."" NUNES SAYS DEMS ENLISTED 'MEDIA MOUTHPIECES' TO GIN UP 'FAKE' IMPEACHMENT GROUNDS Many others took to Twitter to condemn Schiff for the stunt: Fox News’ Brooke Singman contributed to this report. "
"""There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country,"" Omar said after she gave a keynote address at a candidates forum in Iowa, according to a report from  The Guardian  published Saturday. ""And I would say (Biden) is not one of them.""  ""I think it has been very clear to many of the people who have been creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations, that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have, and he doesn't,"" the Minnesota lawmaker added, according to the paper. Omar's office confirmed the comments to CNN. The comments from the progressive congresswoman were made as a number of the  2020 Democratic candidates pitched themselves  this weekend in the first-in-the-nation caucus state as the best contender to take on President Donald Trump. Biden, the pack's centrist front-runner, has faced tough criticism from his fellow candidates for his record, which some have knocked as not being progressive enough. Support for Biden in the state  appeared to have waned this weekend  after a new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers found that the former vice president slipped 3 percentage points since June, while Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is known for her progressive, working-class-focused views, stood at 22% in the poll, up 7 percentage points since the last poll.   Next month, Biden may face more questions about how progressive his record is during  the fourth presidential debate,  hosted in Westerville, Ohio, by CNN and The New York Times. "

"When asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" if he believed Giuliani was potentially criminally liable, Schiff said that ""If Mr. Giuliani was involved in a scheme to coerce a foreign government into giving dirt, manufacturing dirt, on President Trump's political opponent, then yes, that certainly can violate the law -- violate the criminal laws."" ""Do I have any confidence, hope or what not, that the Justice Department would be willing to investigate?"" he added. ""No."" The Justice Department, Schiff said, ""made it clear they're not going to investigate this and they don't want anyone else to. The fact that they would so cavalierly dismiss this credible evidence and say it is not even worthy of us looking into is yet another affirmation that Attorney General Bill Barr believes that he exists to serve the will and interest of the President, not the presidency, and that's exactly what he's doing."" Schiff's comments come the same day acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the Intelligence Committee about his handling of a  whistleblower complaint  that has set off a politically explosive week in Washington.  The document -- which was released publicly Thursday -- alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the upcoming 2020 election, and the White House took steps to cover it up.  A transcript of July phone conversation  released by the White House on Wednesday shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Even before the whistleblower complaint was made available to lawmakers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday declared Trump had betrayed his oath of office and announced she was opening a formal impeachment inquiry into the President. The whistleblower complaint labels Giuliani as ""central figure"" in the controversy.  US officials were concerned, the whistleblower said, with Giuliani and his contacts with Ukrainian officials. The whistleblower alleges that US officials believed Giuliani was a  conduit for messages  between the President and officials in Kyiv and that he was at the helm of a problematic ""circumvention of national security decision making processes."" Speaking to CNN  Thursday, Giuliani said he has ""no knowledge of any of that crap"" in the complaint. Earlier this month, Giuliani  denied  asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden moments before admitting that he had done just that. Schiff wouldn't say Thursday if Giuliani would be called to testify but stressed the former New York City Mayor was ""clearly at the center of a lot of this."" ""I don't want to get into specific witnesses at this point but Mr. Giuliani is clearly at the center of a lot of this. The spadework for this phone call may very well have been done by Rudy Giuliani. It appears to me from reading the transcript that the Ukraine President had a pretty good idea of what might happen on this call. And so, why that's the case and how that was communicated to him, we need to find out,"" he said. ""And I wouldn't be a bit surprised if Rudy Giuliani is a part that have answer."""
"Previous impeachment inquiries were triggered by actual felony violations or allegations of egregious abuse of power, says Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy, former assistant U.S. attorney. Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy said Wednesday that the events surrounding a phone call between  President Trump  and the president of  Ukraine  do not reach the threshold that warrants impeachment. “There’s a lot of feeling around even trying to articulate high crimes and misdemeanors and I think that’s relevant,” McCarthy told  “The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino,”  adding that impeachment controversies surrounding past presidents ""were all triggered by either actual felony violations or allegations of concrete abuses of power that were egregious and everybody knew what they were investigating when they were launched.""

Trump, who has been accused of trying to pressure Zelensky to investigate the family of  Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden  in exchange for releasing military aid, authorized the release of a memorandum of the conversation, which was made public earlier Wednesday.

"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich weighs in on Speaker Nancy Pelosi's formal impeachment inquiry announcement. He says the Democratic Party has 'lost its mind.' In 1994, Newt Gingrich led Republicans to one of the most stunning electoral victories in American history. Twenty-five years later he and his team reveal the inside story of how their Contract With America ended 40 years of House Democratic rule — and changed our politics forever.   The new special -- “Inside the Contract with America” – debuts on Fox News  on September 29 th  at 8pm eastern . It is also available right now on  FOX Nation. Tuesday, when Speaker  Nancy Pelosi  declared, “no one is above the law,” her target was President Donald Trump – but she did far more damage to former Vice President Joe Biden. Democrats  are very excited by a few words in a phone call between the President of the United States and the new, reform-oriented anti-corruption President of Ukraine. Those words asked to open the investigation and to get at the truth. Most Americans will ignore an attack on investigating corruption as just  politics . WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT ON UKRAINE CALL RELEASED, ALLEGES TRUMP SOLICITED FOREIGN 'INTERFERENCE' IN ELECTION However, when Americans learn how deeply involved Hunter Biden was in China and Ukraine while his father was vice president, they will see a scandal involving a lot of money which is easy to understand and easy to condemn. The Biden-Ukraine money problem is not something new. Five years ago, on May 14, 2014, The Washington Post headline warned: “Hunter Biden’s new job at Ukrainian gas company is a problem for U.S. soft power.” Vice President Biden’s intervention to protect his son, and his son’s company Burisma, from a Ukrainian corruption investigation, was heavy-handed and amazingly arrogant. And there is no question that Biden interfered. In his own words to the Council on Foreign Relations on Jan. 23, 2018, Biden clearly pushed to have the prosecutor who was investigating his son fired: “I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from [former Ukrainian President] Poroshenko and from [former Prime Minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn’t. “So they said they had—they were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, I’m not going to—or, we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You’re not the president. The president said—I said, call him. (Laughter.) I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b*tch. (Laughter.) He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.” As Deroy Murdock, who is a member of the council,  wrote for Fox News , “Biden’s actions reek of extortion and obstruction of justice.” Now that the Hunter Biden corruption scandal is beginning to threaten his candidacy, Vice President Biden is trying to come up with a new story. As  Mark Thiessen  wrote for The Washington Post and Fox News in his syndicated column on Tuesday, the former vice president is now claiming he never discussed his son’s business dealings overseas. As Thiessen points out, this claim is “flatly untrue.” Hunter Biden, has already told The New Yorker that Vice President Biden discussed the Ukraine business with his son, saying, “Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do.’” Again citing The New Yorker, Thiessen reported: “‘In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter’s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama administration’s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden. That same month, The New York Times published an article about how Hunter’s business dealings in Ukraine undermined the vice president’s anti-corruption message, which quoted a Biden spokesman saying it had no impact.” However, Ukraine is not the only site of scandalous self-enrichment by Hunter Biden. China is an even bigger center of money going to the former vice president’s son – money which would not have gone to him if his name had been Hunter Smith. Peter Schweizer  has become a remarkable researcher and writer about corruption. In a May, 11, 2019 New York Post article, he wrote extensively about the Bidens and China. The investment firm Hunter Biden operated (along with former-Secretary of State John Kerry’s stepson Chris Heinz and their family friend and operative Devon Archer) in his dealings with China was Rosemont Seneca Partners, which formed in 2009. By 2010, Hunter Biden and Archer “were in China meeting with top Chinese officials,” Schweizer wrote. By the way, Rosemont also partnered with the Thornton Group, which is led by James Bulger (the nephew of the infamous mobster James “Whitey” Bulger). In 2013, Hunter Biden flew to China with his dad on Air Force Two. Within two weeks, Rosemont secured what eventually grew into a $1.5 billion private equity deal with a part of the Bank of China (which is owned by the Chinese Communist Party). So, as Schweizer put it, “the Chinese government-funded a business that it co-owned along with the son of a sitting vice president.” Interestingly, Schweizer wrote that the Thornton Group only touted its China meetings on its Chinese language website, saying “Chinese executives ‘extended their warm welcome’ to the ‘Thornton Group, with its US partner Rosemont Seneca chairman Hunter Biden (second son of the now Vice President Joe Biden).’ The purpose of the meetings was to ‘explore the possibility of commercial cooperation and opportunity.’ One of these meetings between Hunter Biden’s company and Chinese officials happened on the same day Vice President Biden met with then-Chinese President Hu Jintao in Washington as part of the Nuclear Security Summit. And this was the rule rather than the exception.

As he pointed out: CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As Michael Kranish and David L. Stern wrote in The Washington Post on July 22, for more than 20 years, Hunter Biden’s professional career has followed his father’s political career, “from Washington to Ukraine to China.” Speaker Pelosi has raised the correct standard that in America no one is above the law. However, the person who may be found guilty by that standard is former Vice President Biden. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH"

""In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced – as is customary – by the White House Situation Room,""  the complaint  says.

"Constitutional law attorney Jenna Ellis Rives on Democrats' reaction to President Trump allegedly asking Ukraine officials to investigate Joe Biden. CNN political correspondent and famed Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein compared the  Trump-Ukraine  story to… Watergate. Bernstein has been a staunch critic of President Trump and appeared on CNN’s liberal “Reliable Sources” on Sunday to offer his opinion on reports that a  whistleblower  may have accused the president of wrongdoing related to a July phone call with  Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE' Trump reportedly has been accused of asking Ukraine’s leader multiple times to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, and possibly using military aid as leverage. Trump denied making any improper requests – but that didn’t stop Bernstein from comparing it to Watergate. “If the reporting of Shane Harris and the Wall Street Journal is accurate, and it seems to be, it clearly moved toward a grievous abuse of power by the President of the United States. I keep getting asked, ‘Are there echoes of Watergate in this?’ There are in the following ways,” Bernstein said Sunday. “Watergate was very much an attempt by Richard Nixon to undermine the Democratic electoral process.” Bernstein said that Nixon used “political espionage and sabotage” to nominate George McGovern, who Nixon considered the “weakest candidate,” as opposed to Edmund Muskie. BIDEN FACES SCRUTINY FOR DEMANDING OUSTER OF UKRAINE OFFICIAL PROBING FIRM THAT EMPLOYED HIS SON Back in 1972, Bernstein and Bob Woodward reported that a White House aide fabricated a letter detailing Muskie condoning a racial slur against Americans of French-Canadian descent, which derailed his campaign. “Something of the same thing seems to be happening here where Biden, who Trump and his people have said they fear the most, in terms of being an opponent, has been the object of these, perhaps, dirty tricks,” Bernstein continued. ""One thing Nixon never did was engage a foreign power to investigate a candidate running for office in the United States. It is a grievous offense if this is what happened.” Bernstein, along with Woodward, helped take down President Nixon with Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the Watergate scandal in the Washington Post. Fox News’ Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report."
"The Wall Street Journal reports that in a July phone call, President Trump repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son. The controversy over President Trump’s  mysterious call  with a foreign leader that prompted a whistleblower complaint ratcheted up Friday afternoon as a new report said it involved Trump asking the president of Ukraine numerous times in a single phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. Meanwhile, after Trump called the whistleblower a partisan and dismissed the allegation as “another political hack job,” Democrats in Congress accused the president of trying to intimidate whistleblowers and demanded the administration hand over the complaint and a transcript of the call, while 2020 hopefuls renewed calls for impeachment. CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. In a lengthy statement Friday evening, Biden said that if the reports were true ""there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.  ""This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,"" Biden continued. ""It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation—a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia—pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor ..."" ""At minimum,"" Biden concluded, ""Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress."" What initially touched off the  controversy is a secret  whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM   Trump called that initial story “ridiculous” in the Oval Office, and said he doesn’t know the identity of the whistleblower. He wouldn’t say what was discussed in the call but said someone should “look into” Biden family connections to Ukraine. ""I have conversations with many leaders. It's always appropriate. Always appropriate,"" Trump said. ""At the highest level, always appropriate. And anything I do, I fight for this country."" Afterward, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democratic committee leaders issued a statement demanding the administration hand over the complaint, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would not share details of it with lawmakers. “President Trump just went on national television—from the Oval Office—and personally attacked an Intelligence Community whistleblower who reported an urgent matter involving serious or flagrant misconduct,"" the statement said, adding that the ""brazen effort to intimidate this whistleblower risks a chilling effect on future whistleblowers."" After the publication of the Journal’s story, 2020 Democrats quickly weighed in. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro said that Trump “is a criminal.” “He must be impeached immediately,” he said. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said that Trump “appears to be collaborating with foreign governments to attack America’s democracy” before she urged the whistleblower to come forward. “I would absolutely urge this whistleblower to go directly to Congress, whether in closed session or in open session,” she said. Schiff told reporters Friday that the whistleblower claim ""deserves a thorough investigation."" ""Come hell or high water, that’s what we’re going to do,” he said. Democrats have been looking into whether Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure the government to investigate the Biden activities, and have also sought a transcript of the July call between Trump and Zelensky. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The inspector general for the intelligence community received the whistleblower complaint and, according to correspondence with Schiff, considered the allegations “credible” and dealing with an “urgent concern.” Inspector General Michael Atkinson wrote that the DNI, “after consulting with the Department of Justice,” determined the complaint does not have to be shared with the intelligence committees under law. He wrote that he will “abide by that determination,” but disagrees with it. In a letter Tuesday, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of ""urgent concern."" He said the complaint ""concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision."" Maguire is expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. after being subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee. Schiff had accused Maguire of withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioned whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general. Fox News' Alex Pappas, Hillary Vaughn, Andrew Craft and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"But she did not attempt to shield Biden or members of his family from scrutiny as she competes with the former vice president to win the Democratic presidential nomination, though she initially sought to turn attention to Trump's conduct. When asked whether she believed either Biden or his son, Hunter, should be investigated for possible abuse of power, she initially deflected the question by saying, ""Donald Trump is trying to play politics on this issue."" ""He (Trump) is trying to collaborate with -- and conspired with a foreign leader to interfere in our democracy,"" the California senator said during a visit to Oaxacan restaurant in Los Angeles' Koreatown. ""I have absolutely no support for that. And I believe that that this is a political tactic being waged by Donald Trump, because he obviously perceives a threat. That is a political threat, and I have no support for it whatsoever."" There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. But when asked whether she shared the concerns of other Democrats that Biden has too much baggage to be the Democratic nominee for the White House, Harris said, ""I'll leave that to the voters to decide."" ""In my experience, the voters are paying attention to this race, they are paying attention to the issues and people's records,"" Harris said. Still, Harris tried to keep her focus on the current occupant of the White House and her belief that impeachment proceedings should begin now. After visiting with the young second-generation immigrant owners of Guelaguetza, known for its mole and tamales, she pulled out a list of reasons to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump -- ""just to make sure I didn't leave anything out."" ""I strongly believe that it is long past due that we begin impeachment proceedings against this President,"" Harris said. ""He's pressured a foreign leader, the Ukraine President, to dig up dirt on a political opponent, in the 2020 presidential election. He urged a foreign country to attack our democracy in the 2016 presidential election. He gave classified information to Russian officials in May of 2017."" On Friday, CNN reported Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. Trump on Sunday said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Ukraine's President at a time when the country was awaiting a $250 million military aid package from the United States, but he denied doing anything improper. ""The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,"" Trump said.  On Monday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham dismissed Harris' comments on impeachment, telling CNN, ""Another day, another Democrat shouting the word 'impeachment' to anyone who will listen. Nothing new here. "" Harris added that Trump ""undercut the American intelligence community"" in its efforts to deal with North Korea and the American student, Otto F. Warmbier, who was tortured and killed. On her list, she also referenced the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and journalist who wrote for the Washington Post, stating that Trump ""prefers to take the word of Saudi Prince over the word of the American intelligence community"" while adding he also prefers ""taking the word of the Russian President over the word of the American intelligence community when it came to the interference in the 2016 election."" ""He had a national security adviser who secretly worked as a foreign lobbyist and, of course, that was Flynn,"" Harris continued referring to Michael Flynn, Trump's first national security adviser. ""He consistently props up murderous dictators, and again that would be Kim Jong Un, it would be the President of Russia. He has obstructed justice in the investigation into his presidential campaign. And we know that because the Mueller report tells us so -- and gives us 10 examples of just that. He has violated federal law by directing his lawyer to pay $280,000 in hush money to cover up two apparent extramarital affairs -- of course that's the Stormy Daniels case."" Trump has denied having affairs with Daniels and Karen McDougal. She wrapped up the litany of what she views as impeachable offenses by Trump by stating that the President believes he is ""above the law,"" beyond reproach, ""beyond accountability and consequences."" ""It is time that Donald Trump be held accountable for his behaviors that have been essentially against the best interest of the American people and against the best interest of America's democracy,"" she said. She added that she believes that the transcripts between Trump and the Ukrainian President should be released to Congress. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg also weighed in on the controversy on Monday, telling an audience in Dubuque, Iowa, ""We can't go on like this.""  ""We can't have a President admit on national television to trying to involve a foreign government in impacting the American election and accept that as normal,"" he said."
"For just one September week each year, everyone from kings, presidents and prime ministers on down to food tasters fly in to New York City and jam into the United Nations headquarters, in what has become a cliched joke about "" diplomatic speed dating ."" But there's nothing funny about the top priority at this 74th year of UNGA year, which is  the world's climate emergency. The United Nations Climate Summit  The UN has arranged  a special Climate Action summit  on Monday September 23, before the formal speeches given by heads of state and governments that normally draw the most attention. Breaking with tradition,  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres  has told country leaders not to come to the podium Monday without ""concrete and transformative plans"" to halt rising global temperatures, achieve carbon neutrality and cut carbon emissions by 45 percent. VIPs with proposals have been told they have just three minutes to speak. How concrete the results of the summit will actually be is unclear. The UN doesn't have a global climate army to roam the planet stopping pollution, so it's up to the 193 nations of the UN to take action. What the UN will actually do is what some feel the organization sadly does best: collecting the speeches and other environmental brainstorms in a report. The aim is to pressure world leaders to do more, as the climate emergency worsens. Some have made it a top priority -- German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  will be in town for the climate summit, even though she's skipping the rest of the week. In contrast, US President Donald Trump will be in town, but he's skipping the climate summit -- instead  hosting a session on religious persecution  in the same building. Trump has previously avoided international meetings on climate.  Let the General Debate begin The so-called ""general debate"" begins on Tuesday September 24, and the first country to speak is Brazil, by longstanding tradition. It'll be the debut UNGA appearance of Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro, who recently vowed to attend even if in a wheelchair, following recent surgery. Expect fireworks: After high global concern over  massive fires and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon , the  pro-business Bolsonaro  is likely to take climate advocates head-on. He has already promised a ""speech that is different from those that came before"". Following him will be Donald Trump, who has stuck to the teleprompter previously, and last year  drew laughter from delegates  while praising his own administration.  The volume of Trump's appearances and his unpredictability have dominated the past two years of Trump at the General Assembly. Last year, he shocked the visiting Chinese Foreign Minister  by accusing Beijing of interfering in US elections  while both men sat at the Security Council table.  Trump was also the first US President to enter the building and take just a few steps before stopping in front of cameras and shouting reporters, to answer hot topic questions for three days. ""He completely sucked the oxygen out of UNGA,"" Richard Gowan, UN Director at the International Crisis Center says. The elephant in the secretariat This year,  a mysterious attack on Saudi oil fields  has provided some late drama to UNGA, as US officials point the finger at Iran, despite  its denials  and  claims of responsibility by Houthi rebels  in Yemen. The US, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and other Middle East players will all be under one roof for days. Some can't stray too far. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has been slapped by movement restrictions from the US, which confine him to a small zone near the UN headquarters. A senior UN official stated, ""tensions in the Gulf are going to be the backdrop to a lot of events and meetings."" Which leads us to the biggest question on the eve of UNGA: Will President Trump meet Iranian President Rouhani? ‎Nothing is planned between the two leaders, though both will be in the UN building amid the parade of delegations. The threats and rhetoric lobbed by both sides have been fierce. The US imposed more sanctions on Iran on Friday before the high-level week begins, and the Iranians say they don't need to talk. It looks like ""a zero chance for a meeting,"" says Gowan. ""Instead of a diplomatic breakthrough, we're likely to see a war of words."" The UN is meant to be a neutral ground for dueling sides to have dialogue, and chance face-to-face encounters are exactly what this international forum is good for. In 2000, then-US President Clinton and then Cuban President Fidel Castro suddenly stopped briefly for each other in a hallway, when relations between the nations were running cold. There is  still a debate whether a handshake took place . Who's coming to UNGA?  As of Friday, 91 heads of state had committed to attend. French President Macron will be in New York offering an expanded French leadership role as a global mediator, as the Trump administration pulls the US back from international forums. ‎With  significant angst at home  over the UK's planned withdrawal from Europe, Boris Johnson will make his first UNGA appearance in his role as prime minister. Brexit talks are scheduled with Ireland's leader and others. And Indian leader Narendra Modi and Pakistan's leader Imran Khan are both attending and speaking in the General Assembly. No talks are scheduled between them for now, as tensions remain high over  India's treatment of Kashmir,  a disputed territory. And of fresh interest to American audiences will be Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who debuts at UNGA right in the middle of a growing controversy: The US Congress wants to know if  Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden's son , who had business ties in the country. Biden, of course, is one of the main contenders for the US Democratic primary and could end up challenging Trump for the presidency next year. There are also UN meetings big and small on Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, and Myanmar. Apart from marathon hours of speeches, consider this: 630 meetings have been requested. The UN defines a meeting as a gathering of 15 or more people held within the UN for a maximum of three hours. There are ""no less challenges than last year"" affecting geopolitics around the world, said British UN Ambassador Karen Pierce. Expect demonstrators near the UN all day -- though the targets of their anger may not even see them through their tinted limousine windows as they rush to the UN, sirens sometimes wailing. The list of leaders who will not appear this year is also interesting: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping rarely attend, and will not be present this year. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu has canceled,  amid a post-election muddle  back home. Netanyahu, a former UN Ambassador, relishes his General Assembly speeches -- often with props of charts and diagrams -- and he has previously made for must-see TV in between lengthy boring speeches by others.  Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had been listed as a speaker, but is no longer coming in the wake of  multiple revelations of black- and brownface photos  that surfaced from his past, just before national elections. President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela has sent his regards but will not leave his turmoil-filled nation. His rival for the Venezuelan presidency -- National Assembly leader Juan Guaido, whose presidential authority has been acknowledged by more than 50 countries, including the US -- is unlikely to show but representatives will push the UN for future recognition of Guaido's claim to power. Although the immediate premises of the United Nations are international ground, the United States is still the host. According to the ""host country"" agreement, visitors traveling for official UN business are not supposed to be barred, and there was once a time when the US would impose a generous 25-mile radius cordon on international visitors it didn't like. But this year, the US is not holding back. In addition to the movement restrictions on Iran's Zarif, two Cuban diplomats living in New York who had planned to participate in UNGA were ordered expelled by the Trump administration, in a surprise Thursday announcement. And the remaining diplomats at the Cuban mission face the toughest restrictions among all countries: They're not allowed to leave the narrow island of Manhattan. And with all the traffic and security blockades, New Yorkers and tourists ‎too may feel no one can get off the island during this madhouse week."
"The president defends his conversations with world leaders and blasts Joe Biden's 'disgraceful' statement on Ukraine during an Oval Office meeting with Australian PM Scott Morrison. The developing controversy over a mysterious phone conversation  President Trump  had with a foreign leader apparently centers on Ukraine, as the president and his allies fight back and claim the uproar is just another ""partisan"" plot against him. What touched off the  controversy is a secret  whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM   Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, seemed to acknowledge some effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate potential corruption related to the Biden family, though he gave conflicting answers on the matter in a CNN interview overnight. It remains unclear what the supposed ""promise"" from Trump entailed. The president, however, maintained he said nothing improper, tearing into those pushing the allegations Friday. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, alongside visiting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the president blasted the “ridiculous” story, blaming a “partisan whistleblower” and calling it “just another political hack job.” “I don’t know the identity of the whistleblower,” Trump said. He wouldn’t say what was discussed in the call but said someone should “look into” Biden family connections to Ukraine. He also argued the press has had “a bad week,” insisting he has prevailed in controversies reported by the media. “I guess I’m about 22 and 0, and I’ll keep it that way,” the president said. Afterward, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democratic committee leaders issued a statement demanding the administration hand over the complaint. “President Trump just went on national television—from the Oval Office—and personally attacked an Intelligence Community whistleblower who reported an urgent matter involving serious or flagrant misconduct,"" they said, adding that the ""brazen effort to intimidate this whistleblower risks a chilling effect on future whistleblowers."" Earlier Friday, Trump sounded off on Twitter, accusing Schiff of joining with the media to go after him once again. “The Radical Left Democrats and their Fake News Media partners, headed up again by Little Adam Schiff, and batting Zero for 21 against me, are at it again!” the president tweeted Friday. “They think I may have had a ‘dicey’ conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a ‘highly partisan’ whistleblowers statement.” He added: “Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!” For his part, Schiff told reporters Friday that the whistleblower claim ""deserves a thorough investigation."" ""Come hell or high water that’s what we’re going to do,” he said. Meanwhile, allies of the president took to the airwaves to downplay the story ""This is a clear example of someone from the deep state ... from the intelligence community,"" former  Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said on Fox News’  ""The Story with Martha MacCallum."" ""It was completely overblown. ... It will be a big nothing burger."" Fueling intrigue, Giuliani has raised questions about the activities of former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into that company. During an interview Thursday on CNN, Giuliani was asked whether he had asked Ukraine to look into Biden. Giuliani initially said, ""No, actually I didn't,"" but seconds later he said, ""Of course I did."" He explained that he sought for the government to look into how the case was dismissed. Later, Giuliani tweeted, ""A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job."" MATTHEW WHITAKER CALLS REPORTED WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT A 'CLEAR EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE FROM THE DEEP STATE' The whistleblower complaint has triggered a major showdown with Congress, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would not share details of it with lawmakers. The inspector general for the intelligence community received the complaint and, according to correspondence with Schiff, considered the allegations “credible” and dealing with an “urgent concern.” But the watchdog reported to the committee that his office is “at an impasse” with the director of national intelligence over the disclosure. Inspector General Michael Atkinson wrote that the DNI, “after consulting with the Department of Justice,” determined the complaint does not have to be shared with the intelligence committees under law. He wrote that he will “abide by that determination,” but disagrees with it. After a closed-door hearing Thursday with Atkinson, Schiff voiced concerns about not having access to the information, warning Congress could use legal action or budgetary powers as leverage. ""What’s at stake here goes well beyond this complaint and this president,"" he said. Schiff had subpoenaed Maguire saying he was withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioning whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general.

Schiff said last week that Maguire is required to share the complaint with Congress and said the attempt to hold it back ""raises serious concerns about whether White House, Department of Justice or other executive branch officials are trying to prevent a legitimate whistleblower complaint from reaching its intended recipient, the Congress, in order to cover up serious misconduct."" Following Thursday’s Atkinson hearing, Maguire is still expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26.

"Even before the impeachment inquiry against President Trump was announced on Tuesday, the president’s re-election campaign blasted an email to supporters, urging them to defend Mr. Trump against the “baseless and disgusting attacks.” Facebook quickly filled with ads for impeachment-themed merchandise, including $3 “Impeach Now!” bumper stickers and $35 “Impeach This!” T-shirts. In a private chat room, pro-Trump internet trolls discussed which memes, videos and news stories to push on social media in order to reclaim the narrative. The last time America watched an impeachment inquiry, it was largely an analog affair. When the House voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton in 1998, only one in four American homes had internet access. AOL and Yahoo were the biggest websites in the world, and “tweet” was a sound birds made. If the inquiry opened by House Democrats this week results in a formal impeachment of Mr. Trump, it will be the first of the social media era. In many ways, it is a made-for-the-internet event. The political stakes are high, the dramatic story unspools tidbit by tidbit and the stark us-versus-them dynamics provide plenty of fodder for emotionally charged social media brawls. As impeachment looms, disinformation experts are bracing for a fresh cyclone of chaos, complete with fast-twitch media manipulation, droves of false and misleading claims, and hyper-polarized audiences fiercely clinging to their side’s version of reality. “We’ve seen quite a surge in disinformation in the last two days, most of it from trolls and bots, to a degree we haven’t seen in a while,” said Yoel Grinshpon, vice president of research at VineSight, a start-up that detects disinformation on social media. “We assume that this will last a few days, and then come back in waves, whenever a new development in the Biden story or the impeachment process comes to light.” In the past, Democrats have been caught flat-footed by Mr. Trump’s internet fans, who have proved to be adept at inserting noise and confusion into political controversies in real time. When the Mueller report was released this year, the pro-Trump internet rushed to claim victory, blaring “NO COLLUSION” headlines even before the proverbial ink had dried. Fox News and other conservative media outlets joined in the celebration. By the time it emerged that the report had not totally exonerated Mr. Trump, Democrats found themselves shouting through a fog of exaggerations and half-truths. If Democrats want their impeachment narratives to stick, they will need to do a better job of controlling the online battleground, where partisan opportunists jockey to set the narrative in real time and undermine the opposing side. “Politics is being consumed like entertainment,” said Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist. “It’s a choose-your-own-adventure reality.” On Wednesday morning, when a memo summarizing Mr. Trump’s call with the Ukrainian president was released by the White House, the pro-Trump internet seemed unusually sedate. Breitbart, the right-wing website, called the whistle-blower’s report “another deep-state coup” — the equivalent of a ho-hum, “move along, folks” headline. The top-ranked post on Reddit’s biggest pro-Trump forum, r/the_donald, urged followers to pray for Mr. Trump, saying that “he is fighting the American Communist Party all by himself.” On Infowars, the website started by the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the impeachment news appeared below a story about Mattel’s new line of gender-neutral dolls. But by the afternoon, these sites had found their voices, and the battle was raging. Right-wing websites recycled misleading claims that congressional Democrats requested an investigation into Mr. Trump in 2018. Trump partisans stoked a  years-old conspiracy theory  involving CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that has been falsely accused of helping Democrats conceal Ukraine’s involvement in meddling in the 2016 election. They also circulated negative claims about Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, whose business dealings in Ukraine are at the center of the impeachment firestorm. On Wikipedia, volunteer editors  scrambled  to remove dubious information from Mr. Biden’s page. Democrats have also seized the impeachment moment, using social media to solicit donations and gather names and email addresses for voter outreach lists. Julián Castro, the Texas Democrat running for president, bought Facebook ads urging his supporters to sign an impeachment petition. So did Senators Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, two other presidential contenders. Facebook ads bought by Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign offered membership in the “Impeachment Defense Task Force” to people who donated or gave their email addresses and phone numbers, while other ads offered spots on the “Impeachment Defense Team.” Both groups appeared to be primarily marketing tactics, rather than official entities, and the ads gave few details about their activities or mandates. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Veteran digital strategists characterized the impeachment inquiry as a potent opportunity for raising money and collecting voter information. On Wednesday, Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s 2020 campaign manager,  claimed  that the campaign had raised $5 million from small donors in the 24 hours since the impeachment inquiry began. “When we fund-raise online, we’re always looking for ways to create a sense of urgency, like a deadline,” said Mr. Wilson, the Republican digital strategist. “This is like the ultimate deadline.” Impeachment is a lengthy, drawn-out process, and it remains to be seen how long it will capture Americans’ attention. Several partisan online publishers said that the appetite for news about Mr. Trump’s potential impeachment appeared to be lower than the appetite for other four-alarm internet events, like the release of the Mueller report or the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh last year. Mark Provost, a manager of the left-wing Facebook page The Other 98%, said that progressives’ interest in impeachment was “there but tentative.” He added that stories about Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate activist whose impassioned speech to the United Nations General Assembly this week became a viral sensation, were outperforming impeachment-related stories on the page by a 100-to-1 ratio. A moderator of the pro-Trump Reddit forum r/the_donald, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity, speculated that interest in impeachment would increase in the coming days, as more details emerge about the contents of the whistle-blower’s report. In the pre-internet world, impeachment was a dramatic, singular event — the last-ditch option enumerated in the Constitution as the remedy for a lawbreaking president. But today, it’s just one more skirmish in a long-running information battle being fought between partisan keyboard warriors using Twitter threads, YouTube clips and Facebook memes to seize control of the national conversation. “They’ve been through this time and again,” said Jeff Giesea, a Washington-based communications strategist. “This is just another day at the office.”"
"House Democrats flubbed it the first time by spinning in circles, as Pelosi transparently  slow-played  the Mueller impeachment inquiry (or  non-inquiry ) to its seemingly inevitable whimper of an ending. But there's a valuable lesson to be learned from the Mueller case: Impeachment is a remedy both for criminality and for non-criminal abuse of power. And there looks to be plenty of both in the rapidly-unfolding  Ukraine scandal .   Let's start with potential crimes. Based solely on Trump's  own admissions  and the latest Washington Post reporting -- that Trump  suspended  $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before he spoke with the President of Ukraine about an investigation of alleged wrongdoing by Joe Biden, one of Trump's primary political opponents -- he could have violated any or all of these federal criminal laws.  Trump and his defenders  claim  his motive was to root out corruption generally in Ukraine, and Trump  stated  Tuesday that funds ultimately were paid to Ukraine, though he added, ""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they're not doing it."" But why would Trump be so interested in corruption in Ukraine, if not for the Biden connection?  Has he displayed similar levels of concern for corruption in other foreign countries? Trump  tweeted  that he will release a complete, unredacted transcript of his call with the Ukrainian President on Wednesday. The details of that transcript will be crucial, but Trump's preemptive defense falls flat. First, Trump tweeted that his conversation with the Ukrainian President was ""very friendly."" That's irrelevant. People can be downright chipper while still soliciting bribes and foreign election aid. Trump also claims he exerted ""no pressure"" during the call. Perhaps, but his decision to withhold hundreds of millions in foreign aid from Ukraine just before likely created more pressure than any phone call could. And Trump claimed, ""NO quid pro quo."" But people who commit bribery and extortion rarely state the quid pro quo -- the ""this for that"" exchange -- explicitly. And Trump, by his own  original statement,  made clear he equates ""corruption in Ukraine"" with ""investigate Biden"" and little else: ""All of the corruption taking place was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son."" So, what crimes could Trump be violation of? Foreign election aid  -- as Trump should well know from the Mueller report, it is a crime to ""solicit, accept or receive"" a ""thing of value"" in connection with an election from a foreign national. By his own admission, Trump encouraged (""solicited"") Ukraine to investigate Biden by allegedly dangling hundreds of millions of dollars in recently-suspended foreign aid.   While a criminal investigation does not carry a specific price tag, by any commonsense reading it is a ""thing of value."" And a criminal investigation of Biden would be extraordinarily helpful 2020 campaign fodder for Trump, more valuable than any yard sign or bumper sticker. Why else would Trump and his political flacks, such as personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, be so laser-focused on Biden, of all people -- who currently holds no public office but is a  leading contender  to take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election?   Bribery  -- it is illegal for a public official ""directly or indirectly"" to demand, seek, receive or accept any ""thing of value"" in return for ""being influenced in the performance of any official act."" Here, again, a criminal investigation of Biden should qualify as a ""thing of value"" for the Trump 2020 campaign, which Trump plainly sought from Ukraine. The corresponding ""influence in the performance of an official act"" -- the quid pro quo -- is the delivery of foreign aid to Ukraine. Trump himself  has drawn  that link between foreign aid and Ukraine's efforts to root out ""corruption."" Trump  has made clear  that he equates ""corruption"" with the Biden investigation.  Extortion  is the flip side of the bribery coin. Bribery is essentially ""I'll help you, if you help me,"" while extortion is ""I'll harm you, if you don't help me."" The  suspension  of $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before the call is the proverbial brick thrown through the plate glass window: Here's a taste of what'll happen if you don't comply.   Congress first must determine whether Trump committed a crime. If so, then impeachment is imperative. Even Trump's staunchest defenders would have difficulty arguing that he should remain in the White House if he committed a federal crime while in office. But Congress cannot stop at the criminality question. Because even if Trump's conduct dodges the statutory raindrops and doesn't quite meet the definition of any federal crime, impeachment at its core is a remedy for abuse of constitutional power.  Impeachment  need not  be based on a crime. The Constitution  prescribes  impeachment for ""treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors."" But the term ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" is not defined anywhere in the Constitution or statute, and appears to be  drawn from  English parliamentary practice, which provided for impeachment for crimes or for conduct beyond established criminal law.  The Constitution separates  impeachment  from criminal prosecution. Draft  articles of impeachment  against President Richard Nixon included abuse of power and misuse of public office, while one of the proposed articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton (voted down by the full House) related to  abuse of power  for non-criminal conduct. Fundamentally, impeachment is a political process with a political remedy (removal from office), while criminal charges address violations of law by imposing a punitive remedy (imprisonment and/or a fine). This is where House Democrats have dropped the ball following the Mueller report. Because Mueller did not explicitly find that Trump committed criminal obstruction of justice -- given the Justice Department  policy  against indicting a sitting president -- Congress, reined in by Pelosi, has chosen not to make use of the political side of impeachment except for its minimal, superficial progress on a glacial impeachment inquiry.   Until now, Pelosi has stuck to her commitment not to pursue impeachment, instead offering up limp and hopeless legislative proposals. But Trump's conduct here is so flagrant, so lawless and so abusive that Pelosi   is now changing course on impeachment.   By stepping up and seriously pursuing impeachment, House Democrats can salvage their legacy and  meet their obligation  to defend the Constitution against ""all enemies, foreign and domestic."" Now, your questions Lee, California: Does the House Intel Committee have a legal right to see the intelligence community whistleblower complaint about Trump? On its face, the law  is straightforward . If the Intelligence Community inspector general (IG) receives a complaint and deems it to be (1) of ""urgent concern"" and (2) ""credible,"" then he or she ""shall submit"" the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees. In the Ukraine whistleblower case, the inspector general --  a Trump appointee  -- reviewed the complaint and  found that  it raised an urgent concern and was credible, and should be submitted to Congress.   But that's when the director of National Intelligence (DNI) stepped in. After consulting with Attorney General William Barr's Justice Department, the DNI  concluded  that the IG should not forward the complaint to Congress because the President is not ""a member of the Intelligence Community"" and the conduct did not ""involve an intelligence activity under the DNI's supervision."" In other words, according to the DNI and Justice Department, the law does not apply to the President. That appears to leave the DNI and Justice Department (on one hand) and the IG and Congress (on the other) at an impasse. Acting DNI Joseph Maguire  is scheduled to testify  in the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. While there likely will be plenty of accusations and fireworks, do not expect the DNI and Congress suddenly to reach a mutual resolution. Instead, this dispute seems headed for the courts where, even in the best-case scenario, it will take months to resolve.   That said, there is nothing to prevent Congress from investigating even without the complaint in hand. While the whistleblower complaint could be important to Congress's investigation, Congress need not await the complaint's arrival before taking action.       Yvonne, Arizona: Some of the allegations about both President Donald Trump and Justice Brett Kavanaugh pertain to their conduct before taking office. Can an official be impeached based on conduct that occurred before the person was in office?  Yes. Article 1 of the Constitution  explicitly grants  the House the ""sole power of impeachment"" and the Senate ""the sole power to try all impeachments,"" with no limitation on the time frame of the conduct that can form the basis for impeachment. Typically, where the Constitution contains no explicit limitation on a power, courts are reluctant to read in or impose such a restriction.   In fact, federal officials have been impeached for conduct predating their time in office. Most recently, in 2010, federal judge Thomas Porteus  was impeached and convicted  on various counts, some of which related to his conduct as a state judge (before joining the federal bench) and during his nomination and confirmation process. As a practical matter, it could be more difficult to rally political support for impeachment based on conduct before a subject took office, but legally there is no bar to it.   Craig, Canada: Does Congress have the authority to levy fines on witnesses who refuse to answer questions, like former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski?   As the Trump administration repeatedly contests and defies congressional subpoenas, House Democratic leaders have  openly contemplated  utilizing new enforcement mechanisms, including fines. However, there is no specific law on the books that gives Congress the right to levy fines and, in fact,  nobody has ever been fined  by Congress for defying a subpoena. But constitutional scholar Kia Rahnama  convincingly argues  that Congress's inherent enforcement powers likely include the power to impose fines.   While the current Congress could try to impose fines, there are major practical obstacles to actually collecting. First, there is enough legal uncertainty that the recipient of a fine could contest the issue in courts. It likely would take months to adjudicate the issue. Second, even if Congress did clearly have the power to fine a witness, I'd expect Lewandowski or other Trump loyalists to simply refuse to pay; much as Trump already has announced he will ""fight all the subpoenas,"" he likely would  fight all the fines.  Congress would again have to go to the courts seeking an order requiring the witness to pay up. Essentially, if Congress tried to force Lewandowski to pay a fine, I'd expect him to respond, ""Make me."" Congress ultimately might succeed, but not without a long and bruising legal fight that likely would detract from its core investigative and oversight mission.  Three questions to watch 1) Will Pelosi  finally see the light  and permit her caucus to move forward on impeachment? 2) Will House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff take the intelligence community whistleblower case to court? 3) Will either Trump or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell make the first move to endorse even  a limited gun control legislative package ?

"Presidents these days always seem to get worse, don’t they?  To many on the left, Donald Trump is an order of magnitude more disastrous a commander in chief than was George W. Bush, whose reputation now stands thoroughly  rehabilitated  in the popular culture. Bush is no longer the incurious man who launched an unnecessary  war  that killed  hundreds of thousands  in Iraq; today, he’s the goofy old fella who  paints portraits of the troops ,  pals around with Michelle Obama  and seems to be in on the joke of our times.  “Sorta makes me look pretty good, doesn’t it?” Bush  has been reported  to smirk about the Trump era.  For the record, I think the jury is still out on whether Trump is worse than Bush. But for most of 2019, I’ve been trying to picture a future that elevates Trump in the same way it did Bush: How much worse could all t his  get? And worse in what direction — what politics, policies, rhetoric and media mastery will the next extremely terrible president marshal to ruin America anew?  In short: What sort of character do we have to imagine occupying the White House in 2029 to make lefties like myself feel even a slight pang of nostalgia for the good old days of Donald J. Trump?  The thought experiment is instructive because it compels us to ponder some of the fundamental forces shaping American culture and politics at the moment. It is also horrifying, because what quickly becomes evident is that we  might  now be only in the middle of everything spinning out of control.  Come, take a stroll with me through my recurrent nightmare: It’s the sweltering summer of 2029, and the man in charge is Tucker Carlson — that is, President Tucker Carlson, the one-time Fox News talker turned righteous, white nationalist economic populist, now in his triumphant second term, after having defeated the incumbent Joseph “Recession Joe” Biden back in 2024. Like Trump, President Carlson  spends  his first term refashioning America along racial lines. But unlike Trump, whose one term is now regarded by much of the right as a best-forgotten political disaster,  Carlson  advances an ethnonationalist populism that succeeds in  a  wild, frightening fashion. His secret: competence, a commitment to true political realignment, and a brutal online political machine that represents the full flowering of the tactics and ideology first displayed during  2014’s Gamergate  movement. Where Trump was a chaotic, undisciplined narcissist, the Carlson who wins in 2024 is a canny political strategist who makes good on Trump’s forgotten promise to embrace anti-corporate economic policies. On paper, parts of Carlson’s agenda seem ripped from the former liberal firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren (now in exile in Toronto): His  chief enemies  are Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, the megacorporations owned and staffed by wealthy liberals.  It’s a winning electoral formula: A large minority of Americans are willing to forgive Carlson’s authoritarian, nativist impulses if they see it as part of a war against the out-of-touch, culture-destroying corporations that are automating our jobs; killing every other industry; and exercising complete control over what we watch, read, listen to, buy and believe. And in America, thanks to the Electoral College, winning over a large minority is good enough to  regularly win the presidency .  Obviously I am making all of this up. But my premonition is based on months of research — this is what you might call an  educated  nightmare. My education: Carlson’s own nightly Fox News show, which I’ve been watching obsessively since January. I began tuning in because Carlson — who,  with nearly three million viewers a night , is the second most popular host on cable, after Sean Hannity — has become one of the most fascinatingly terrifying men in conservative media.  There are  two  things that terrify and fascinate me about Carlson. First,  unlike  most  Republican  lawmakers today, Carlson is sketching an economic vision of a post-Trump America that departs in key ways from Trumpism, especially in its muscular anti-corporate, populist zeal.  In January,  in a commentary that went viral on the right , Carlson excoriated American political leaders for their commitment to empty capitalism: “For our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer,”  he said . “They teach us it’s more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids.”  He regularly criticizes the tech giants , whom he argues are censoring his and his followers’ views. But he also hates corporations more generally for what he calls their attempts to influence culture and politics (including  by boycotting his show ): His critics,  he said in May , “believe democracy is when a tiny group of rich people imposes its values on everyone else by force.""  In June,  Carlson praised Elizabeth Warren’s plan for “economic patriotism” : “Many of Warren’s policy prescriptions make obvious sense,” he said, wondering why Republicans, including Trump, didn’t join her vision. “What if the Republican leadership here in Washington had bothered to learn the lessons of the 2016 election?” The second thing that scares me about Carlson is his racism, which is both more extreme and more cannily packaged for a digital audience than is Trump’s.  While Trump is a creature of cable television, Carlson’s segments look like extended YouTube clips, and they’re designed to play to an audience that is  extremely online.  His critics and  white supremacists themselves  point out that, more than anyone else on television, Carlson functions as a kind of  laundromat for white identity movements : Several times a week, he’ll lift ideas, story lines and troll-based narratives directly from the fetid swamp of online hatred. Then he’ll clean these theories up and wrap them in a bow for his mainstream audience, usually to advance an overarching idea that he mentions constantly: that, thanks to  an “invasion” of immigrants , white people in America and Europe face economic and cultural calamity, and that the political, corporate and media establishments are abetting their destruction.  “No one covers white identity more consistently than Tucker,” said Madeline Peltz, who  watches Carlson’s show every night  as a researcher for Media Matters for America, a liberal advocacy group that tracks conservative outlets. “I cannot remember a single episode in the last two years that didn’t include these  ideas. ” I’d known all this before I started watching, but actually watching blew my mind: Carlson’s propaganda was so constant, and the sleight of hand with which he inserted barely sanitized racist theories into his broadcast so swift, that I began to see the outlines of my nightmare — that Trump was only a prelude, and that even if he loses next year, someone far more sophisticated than our current president could come along to push digitally mediated politics in an even darker direction.  Carlson — who talks often with Trump, and was reportedly instrumental in advising Trump against  attacking Iran in June  —  recently disclaimed any interest in running for president . He has been a nimble shape-shifter over the course of his career (a decade ago,  he was a libertarian ), so it’s possible that his latest critiques of capitalism are  just an act .  But he may also have noticed that  there are lots of conservative voters in America who don’t care for the Republican Party’s giveaways to corporations . Hence the outlines of a political vision: Carlson is aiming to mix a lefty-sounding economic agenda with a white nationalist-inspired cultural agenda — and to muddy the marriage by arguing that his and his followers’ ideas are being  stifled by the tech giants that he’s fighting .  This is Carlson’s entire schtick. He uses the cover of capitalist hardship to advance theories of white oppression, often  while summoning further harassment of his critics . He’s taking it to television, five nights a week. And where it ends up could be hellish. Office Hours With Farhad Manjoo Farhad wants to  chat with readers on the phone .

"Trump addresses reporters as he arrives at the United Nations, says 'what Biden did was wrong.' President Trump  did not mince words on Monday when voicing his feelings toward the  media’s coverage  of reports that the president pressured Ukraine's leader to help investigate political rival Joe Biden. Calling the White House press corps “crooked as hell,” a riled up Trump slammed the media for “double standards” over what he claimed was the failure of the press to report on allegations of unsubstantiated wrongdoing by Biden and his son, Hunter, related to dealings with Kyiv. “Joe Biden and his son are corrupt, but the fake news doesn’t want to report because they’re Democrats,” Trump said in New York during United Nations meetings. “If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair.” ROMNEY WANTS ANSWERS IN WHISTLEBLOWER STORY Trump added: Look at the double standards, you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves…You got a lot of crooked journalists, you’re crooked as hell.” The president’s heated comments came as congressional Democrats are pressing for a full disclosure of a whistleblower's complaint about Trump’s phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump acknowledged Monday that he didn't want to give money to Ukraine if there were corruption issues. His comments raised further questions about whether he improperly used his office to pressure the country into investigating the former vice president and his family. ""It's very important to talk about corruption,"" Trump told reporters as he opened meetings at the United Nations. ""If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is, is corrupt?"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump has sought to implicate Biden and his son, Hunter, in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son. The matter is under new scrutiny following the whistleblower's mid-August complaint, which followed Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The person who filed the complaint did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, according to a person familiar with the matter. Lawmakers are demanding details of the complaint, but the acting director of national intelligence has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. Trump hinted on Monday that he may release the details of the phone conversation, but said its contents mainly consisted of congratulating the new Ukrainian leader. Fox News’ John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"KEENE, N.H. — Senator Elizabeth Warren’s message on impeachment was blunt and brief. On a college campus here, Ms. Warren reminded a crowd of hundreds that she had called for President Trump’s impeachment last spring, after the release of Robert S. Mueller III’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. Taking action against Mr. Trump, she said then, was “a matter of constitutional responsibility.” “If Congress does not hold this man accountable, then he will break the law again and again and again,” Ms. Warren said Wednesday. “It is time for impeachment now.” She said she was pleased the House of Representatives had “stepped up” and expressed hope the process would move “quickly.” And then, less than three minutes after she began speaking, Ms. Warren turned away from the subject. Ms. Warren was not the only Democrat on Wednesday to attempt such a balancing act, as other candidates blended urgent denunciations of Mr. Trump with broader arguments for their own campaigns. Across the Democratic field, candidates are approaching the impeachment battle stirring in Washington as a matter to be addressed but also contained — a necessary process, but perhaps not one that ought to redefine their own campaigns. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont released a statement labeling Mr. Trump’s “self-dealing and corruption” as “limitless,” and praising the House for  formally opening an impeachment inquiry . But he also tweeted about homelessness and outsourced jobs after walking on a picket line in Michigan. Senator Kamala Harris of California said in interview that she was shocked by the summary of a phone call the president made to the leader of Ukraine in which he urged his counterpart to investigate one of his political rivals, Joseph R. Biden Jr. But she also said her candidacy would remain focused on the scope of Mr. Trump’s presidency and not a single episode or the impeachment question narrowly. And Mr. Biden, who held no public events on Wednesday, issued his own statement saying he would be focused “not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America’s families.” Candidates like Ms. Warren may have the stature to communicate with voters over the din of impeachment. She has risen rapidly in the polls in recent weeks, threatening to overtake Mr. Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Ms. Warren was the first of the major Democratic candidates to demand Mr. Trump’s impeachment, but mentions Mr. Trump sparingly in her speeches. Even she is declining to transform her campaign into a crusade for his ouster. Image Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke in Wilmington, Del., on Tuesday. Credit Mark Makela for The New York Times Democratic voters, too, appear not to be focused with singular intensity on impeachment: Ms. Warren’s rhetoric on the matter drew loud applause, but no louder than the crowd’s reaction to her arguments about climate change, racial inequality and government corruption. Among the people in Ms. Warren’s audience, there was a sense of outrage about Mr. Trump’s conduct and  a sense of  support for the steps taken this week by House Democrats to investigate him more aggressively. But there was little optimism that Mr. Trump might ultimately be removed from office, and some expressed anxiety at the unpredictability of the impeachment process. Tim Butterworth, a retired teacher who is supporting Ms. Warren, said he believed the House had a duty to proceed with impeachment even though there was “kind of a stone wall” waiting in the Republican-controlled Senate. Mr. Butterworth did not mention Ms. Warren’s support for impeachment among his reasons for supporting her, focusing instead on her plans for addressing economic inequality. “I think it would be easier to defeat him in an election,” Mr. Butterworth, 75, said of the president. “But when you see a crime being committed, you have to report it. If you don’t, you’re complicit.” Ellen Moran, an undecided voter who works in urgent care, expressed both exasperation with Mr. Trump and some trepidation about impeachment. Ms. Moran, who is deciding between Ms. Warren and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., said it was “embarrassing, frankly, as an American that we have to come down to this.” Earlier in the day, Ms. Warren was one of at least two candidates, along with the former housing secretary  Julián Castro , who labeled  the reconstruction of the phone call  a “smoking gun.”  The call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is at the center of accusations that Mr. Trump pressured a foreign leader to open a potential corruption investigation tied to Mr. Biden, who is seeking to challenge Mr. Trump in 2020. The news of the call — which was first revealed by a whistle-blower who works in the intelligence community — prompted House Democrats to say on Tuesday they would  formally open an impeachment inquiry .  The rapid developments in Washington provided a rare chance for most of the 19 Democratic candidates to offer a unified response in a primary that has increasingly seen them draw distinctions with each other in an attempt to stand out. T he near-uniform embrace of an impeachment inquiry represents a significant shift from this spring, after the release of the report by the special counsel, Mr. Mueller, on Russian interference in the 2016 election, when  fewer candidates  explicitly endorsed beginning an impeachment inquiry.  Poll after poll has shown that Democratic voters’ top priority is beating Mr. Trump in the 2020 general election, and the allegations that he pressured a foreign leader in an effort to hurt a political rival have enabled the candidates to collectively paint him as unfit to occupy the presidency.  In the interview, Ms. Harris said the time for impeachment had come. “This guy has told us who he is,” she said. “He believes he’s above the law. And everything that has happened in these years continues to tell us that.” Her  campaign on Wednesday also highlighted the role of  Attorney General William P. Barr  in the various controversies surrounding Mr. Trump.  Ms. Harris’s communications director resurfaced  an exchange  between Ms. Harris and Mr. Barr during  a  Senate Judiciary Committee hearing  in May  about Mr. Mueller’s report, in which she asked the attorney general whether Mr. Trump had ever asked him to open an investigation into anyone else.  After much hesitation, Mr. Barr said he did not know.  Video In May, Senator Kamala Harris asked Attorney General William P. Barr whether President Trump or any member of his administration had ever suggested that he “open an investigation of anyone.” Credit Credit Andrew Harnik/Associated Press In the interview, Ms. Harris, a former prosecutor who ran California’s Department of Justice, raised concerns about the fact that Mr. Trump had urged Mr. Zelensky to contact Mr. Barr about opening an investigation.  “Is he using his power in a way that’s for political advantage rather than the pursuit of justice?” Ms. Harris asked. “Yes, I have a question about where is this attorney general’s loyalty, and to whom, and to what end.” Not every candidate in the Democratic primary supports an impeachment inquiry. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who has long opposed that remedy,  argued Tuesday on Fox News  that “impeachment at this juncture would be terribly divisive for the country.”  And on Wednesday,  she said  that seeing the reconstructed transcript had not changed her mind. “Most people reading through that transcript are not going to find that extremely compelling cause to throw out a president,” she said. Most of the rest of the Democratic candidates however were unequivocal in their calls for an impeachment investigation to begin. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said  that the memo on the phone call was “apparent proof that Trump had pressured a foreign nation to meddle in our democracy again.”  “History will remember those who put politics aside at this time of crisis and treated it like the moral moment that it is,” he said. Senator  Amy Klobuchar  of Minnesota said that the record of the call was “deeply disturbing,” adding that Mr. Trump had “violated the public’s trust.” “It’s shameful,” she said. “Our country deserves better.” And Mr. Castro, in an interview, called Mr. Trump’s conduct “egregious.” “I want to see Donald Trump held accountable and for the House to move forward with impeachment,” he said.

"WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced  a formal impeachment inquiry  on Tuesday amid mounting furor over  President Trump’s  efforts to pressure Ukraine’s government to investigate former  Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.,  apparently the subject of a classified  whistle-blower complaint  the administration refused for weeks to show to Congress before  dropping  objections.  Mr. Trump, meanwhile, said he planned on Wednesday to release the transcript of a phone call he had in July with  President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine . Mr. Trump insisted it would show that he said nothing inappropriate, but scrutiny about his conduct toward Ukraine has  spread beyond  the single conversation. Here are some of the basic facts behind the controversy. What did Mr. Trump do? Mr. Trump  is said to have pressured  Mr. Zelensky  to investigate Mr. Biden and his younger son, Hunter — both directly and through a proxy, Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers. As a leading candidate to be the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nominee, Mr. Biden is Mr. Trump’s political rival. As vice president, Mr. Biden  pushed the Ukrainian government in 2015 to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin , who was widely seen as an obstacle to reform because he failed to bring corruption cases. At the time, Mr. Biden’s son sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma Holdings.  Mr. Trump and his allies have insinuated, without evidence, that Mr. Biden was trying to protect the company from prosecution. An investigation into him, even if it were unfounded or turned up no evidence of a crime, could damage his campaign prospects by suggesting wrongdoing. Did Mr. Trump use American foreign policy to try to damage a political rival? This is the big question. The White House froze more than $391 million in military assistance to  Ukraine  this summer that Congress had appropriated. The money was intended to help Ukraine defend itself from Russian territorial aggression, including a military conflict in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014.  Video President Trump is facing calls for impeachment related to a phone call with Ukraine’s president. Who’s the man on the other end of the phone? Credit Credit Sergey Dolzhenko/EPA, via Shutterstock Mr. Trump  has given conflicting explanations for the freeze. On Monday, he cited corruption in Ukraine as the reason for the delay. On Tuesday, he instead said he had held up the military assistance because European countries had not paid their fair share to help defend Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, from Russian incursions. Mr. Trump directed Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff,  to pause the aid  in the days before his July phone call with  Mr. Zelensky , senior administration officials said. The Trump administration abruptly  unfroze the package  this month amid mounting questions about what Mr. Trump was doing with Ukraine. Why is this coming up now? An intelligence official  filed a whistle-blower complaint last month  about the president’s actions. The inspector general for the intelligence community deemed the complaint “credible” and “urgent” and forwarded it to the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, under a law  that says  such complaints must be shown to Congress within a week.  But Mr. Maguire refused to share the complaint with Congress, saying the Justice Department disagreed with the inspector general’s conclusion that its subject matter was covered under the law that requires disclosing such complaints to Congress. The issue came into the open when the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, sent an  angry letter to Mr. Maguire on Sept. 10 , accusing him of  violating the law.   Mr. Maguire  relented  as the  impeachment inquiry  came into focus. He was expected to release a redacted version of the complaint in coming days, people familiar with the situation said late on Tuesday. Administration officials were also said to be working on a deal to allow the  whistle-blower  to file the complaint to congressional investigators.  Mr. Maguire is set to testify about the matter on Thursday. What did the whistle-blower claim? The complaint’s full details remain a mystery, as does the  whistle-blower’s  identity. Because Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have openly acknowledged pressuring Ukraine about “corruption” and the Bidens, it is not clear how much the complaint involves that is not already in plain view.  But in a closed-door briefing with the House Intelligence Committee, the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson,  said that the complaint involved multiple actions, according to two officials familiar with his briefing , suggesting that the matter goes beyond Mr. Trump’s July phone call. What does Mr. Trump say? The president insists that he has been unfairly accused, saying — without offering evidence — that the whistle-blower is “partisan” and that Democrats and the news media are initiating a new “witch hunt” against him. Mr. Trump has also said that he is aware that his conversations with foreign leaders are monitored by numerous government officials and that he would not incriminate himself so easily. What is Mr. Giuliani’s role? Mr. Giuliani has communicated with Ukrainian officials for months about the Bidens. He has also pressed them about the circumstances of the 2016 disclosures of payments earmarked by a Russia-aligned Ukrainian political party to Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman, who is  in federal prison  on convictions related to his Ukrainian political work. Mr. Giuliani has sought information about both subjects and traveled to Madrid this summer for a meeting with one of Mr. Zelensky’s top aides, whom he urged to investigate the matters. In May, Mr. Giuliani  told The New York Times  that he was pushing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens “because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.”  Did Mr. Biden do something wrong? No evidence has emerged that Mr. Biden was trying to help his son when he pushed for the dismissal of the Ukrainian prosecutor, who was widely seen in the West as corrupt. Stamping out high-level corruption in Ukraine had long been a central goal of Obama administration policy toward the country and a standard condition for Western aid. On Saturday,  Mr. Biden said he had never spoken with his son  about any overseas work. Mr. Biden played a lead role in the Obama administration’s diplomacy with Kiev, though administration officials worried that his son’s work for the energy   company, Burisma Holdings, could create at least the perception of a conflict of interest.  But Ukraine’s current top prosecutor has said  there is no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens  to investigate."

"Pelosi announces plans to go forward; Mike Emanuel has the details. Former White House Communications Director  Anthony Scaramucci  suggested that  President Trump 's time in office is running out, insisting that it's ""only a matter of time"" before he's removed from office. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., on Tuesday announced a  formal impeachment inquiry , saying ""the president must be held accountable"" for his ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections."" ""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella. COMEY SAYS HE HOPES CONGRESS DOESN'T IMPEACH TRUMP: IT LETS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 'OFF THE HOOK' ""The president must be held accountable,"" she continued. ""No one is above the law."" In the wake of Pelosi's announcement, Scaramucci, who worked for only a few days at the White House and has recently become a vocal critic of the president, said Trump's days in the Oval Office are numbered. ""He is gone. It's only a matter of time now and negotiation. @realDonaldTrump is done,"" Scaramucci said. The impeachment debate was renewed last week after a ""whistleblower"" from the intelligence community called attention to a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which the president, with aid to Ukraine frozen, allegedly urged an investigation into Hunter Biden, son of  former Vice President Joe Biden , who'd had business dealings there. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The president has been accused of leveraging military aid to Ukraine in order for the nation to launch a probe into his political opponent."
"The facts of whether the President pressured Ukraine to investigate his potential Democratic general election opponent  Joe Biden  while a US military aid package was on the table are still obscured. Trump supporters say there is so far no evidence that he offered a quid pro quo to the Ukrainians and note that an intelligence community  whistleblower who raised the alarm  was operating with a second-hand knowledge of Trump's conversations. But if Trump used his power to try to coerce a foreign leader into influencing US elections, it could precipitate the worst political crisis of a presidency that has been mired in notoriety from its first hours. It would amount to a situation in which Trump's team, which according to the Mueller report expected to benefit from Russian election meddling in 2016, is now using the power of the presidency to incite collusion ahead of the 2020 election. That possibility seemed to unlock a shift Sunday in the Democratic position on impeachment. House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said on CNN that Trump may have ""crossed the Rubicon."" And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- who has been loath to contemplate an impeachment drama -- warned that events might necessitate a ""new stage of investigation."" Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat on the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs panels, told CNN on Monday morning, ""I think we're reaching a tipping point both within our base and within our caucus."" Republican senators who have strongly supported Trump were largely silent but Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah  tweeted  Sunday ""it would be troubling in the extreme"" if Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden and that it is ""critical for the facts to come out."" There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son Hunter. The then-Ukrainian prosecutor general Yury Lutsenko said in May that Burisma Holdings, a major energy company,  did not violate Ukrainian law  by having Hunter Biden on its board and paying him. Trump's claims that Biden pushed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor because he investigated a business for which his son served as a board member have previously been found to be false. The prosecutor was seen as corrupt by multiple governments and international institutions, not just the former vice president. Why pressure by Trump on Ukrainians would matter Presidents are expected to act in the interests of all Americans and not to use their vast discretion in foreign policy to pursue political vendettas or subvert US democracy. The Founders saw the presidency as a public trust, meaning that its incumbents should not put their personal interests over the national interest. The Ukraine story is so significant because it may have the potential to fall into such grave constitutional territory and could represent an abuse of presidential power. Trump and his team seemed at odds Sunday over whether to publish the transcript of his conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And they went on offense in typical fashion, bending facts and spinning conspiracy theories, obfuscation and hypocrisy. Trump insisted that he said ""absolutely nothing wrong"" in the call with the Ukrainian president. ""It was perfect,"" he said. Trump often gives the impression that he believes he is not constrained by norms on the limits of power observed by past presidents. In July for instance, he said, falsely, that Article 2 of the Constitution ""allows me to do whatever I want as President."" Past scrapes like the 2016 Russian election meddling scandal -- and multiple controversies ranging from his insulting behavior toward the late Sen. John McCain to his payments to women who claimed they had affairs with him -- have failed to bring him down. His emergence from each may have taught him a lesson. Trump says he spoke to Ukrainian President about Biden Trump on Sunday appeared to add new context to the Ukraine story when he said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Ukraine's president at a time when Kiev was awaiting a $250 million military aid package from the United States. The call with Zelensky took place on July 25. Congress passed the bill in August and the White House lifted a hold on the money in September. ""The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,"" Trump said. CNN has reported that Trump urged Zelensky to investigate Biden's son in a call on July 25, but did not discuss a pending aid package at the time, indicating there may not have been an explicit quid pro quo outlined in the conversation. The latest developments highlighted Pelosi's reluctance to trigger impeachment proceedings against Trump amid fears of a political backlash. But Schiff, a Pelosi ally, suggested things may be about to change. ""This would be an extraordinary remedy, a remedy of last resort and not first resort,"" Schiff said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""But if the President is essentially withholding military aid at the same time he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that that conduct represents."" Pelosi and Schiff were in close coordination throughout the weekend talking about the Ukraine whistleblower story and coordinating strategy, a leadership aide confirmed to CNN. The way that events could force the hands of Democratic leaders became even clearer later on Sunday. Pelosi hinted at a change of strategy in a message to Democratic colleagues, over half of whom had already backed the idea of impeachment. ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi wrote on Sunday. Democratic reluctance on impeachment Pelosi has been reluctant to embrace impeachment since Senate Republicans are unlikely to vote to convict the President. There is also no desire to set Trump's political base alight as Democrats try to keep their House majority in 2020. If Trump's behavior is exposed as corrupt, Democrats may be forced into impeachment hearings -- whatever the long-term political cost. To do nothing would be to accept that a President can abuse his power by seeking foreign interference in American democracy. Trump would feel validated and emboldened. The balance between Congress and the Presidency will have been fundamentally altered and there will be few checks and balances left capable of constraining Trump and future presidents. Inaction might also be politically unsustainable since Democrats might see their own leaders as willing to use the power of a House majority to defend their own presidential front-runner. Democrats, both freshmen from Trump-won districts and moderates who have resisted calls for impeachment, are telling their colleagues privately they are prepared to announce their support for impeachment proceedings if the controversy continues to grow -- namely if there's evidence that Trump sought to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigating the Bidens, according to Democratic sources involved in the conversations on Monday morning.   That could change the calculus for Pelosi, who has in part resisted because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash over impeachment. But if those members come out in support of impeachment proceedings, Pelosi is bound to shift her positioning as well, according to Democrats close to the speaker. Trump allies hit back Seeking to fog such questions, Trump's lieutenants went on the offensive on Sunday talk shows using a familiar playbook. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo revived debunked questions about Biden's conduct. ""I do think if Vice President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt, I do think we need to get to the bottom of that,"" Pompeo said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""America cannot have our elections interfered with, and if that's what took place there, if there was that kind of activity engaged in by Vice President Biden, we need to know."" For the administration to make an argument about electoral interference seems somewhat rich, given that Trump has long rejected evidence that Russia intervened in 2016 to help him. On ""State of the Union,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said there was no reason to believe Trump pressured Ukraine, though admitted he wasn't on the call in question. And he argued that Biden's son should not have been allowed to do business in Ukraine while his father was vice president. Asked by Jake Tapper Sunday about the glaring inconsistency in this statement since Trump's children continue to work globally on a business from which the President has not fully divested, Mnuchin dodged. ""I don't really want to go into more of these details,"" Mnuchin said. Both Mnuchin and Pompeo opposed releasing transcripts of Trump's calls, arguing that a President has a right to confidentiality in conversations with foreign leaders. The administration's efforts to stop acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire from releasing the whistleblower report to Congress, and its opposition to releasing a transcript, are only fueling speculation the White House has something to hide. If there was wrongdoing such conduct could equal obstruction of justice, historically an impeachable offense. Trump, however, said that he hoped they would release the transcript. Biden, meanwhile, spent the weekend  defending himself  and trying to turn the scandal to his own advantage in a tight primary race. ""Trump is doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum and he is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" Biden said. This story has been updated with additional developments Monday."
"Elizabeth Warren  did not want a goodbye party. She told her aides there would be no grand send-off, no celebration of a mission accomplished. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had been her idea from the start: a new arm of the government, uniquely empowered to police the kinds of loans and financial schemes that led to the Great Recession. Ms. Warren had detailed the idea in a journal article, then cajoled and pressured Congress to make it law. She was tasked by President Barack Obama in 2010 with setting up the bureau, and spent a year recruiting investigators and enforcers for an office they saw as an exhilarating cause. But as spring turned to summer in 2011, Ms. Warren faced a wrenching separation. The White House had decided not to nominate her to lead the bureau permanently. So she gathered the staff for an “all hands” meeting and told them her work there was over. “She told us that we were ready to sail the ship, that we did not need her there, and that we would be able to do it on our own,” said Patricia McCoy, a Boston College law professor who was a senior official at the bureau. Ms. Warren was right. Under her successor, Richard A. Cordray, the bureau would recover $12 billion for consumers from financial institutions by 2017. It would become, to supporters, a prized example of the government taking on big banks after the 2008 financial crisis. To opponents — Republican lawmakers, business associations and a few conservative Democrats — it would become an example of “runaway government,” an agency to be curbed at the first  opportunity . To Ms. Warren, the bureau is something else as well: a formative lesson in how an idea — a plan — can become reality. For it was through creating a new financial regulator that Ms. Warren developed the approach to government that now guides her  presidential campaign . And it was in losing the chance to lead her bureau that Ms. Warren came to see the value of asking voters, rather than a president, to give her power. A review of Ms. Warren’s role in creating the consumer bureau, including interviews with more than 30 people involved in the process, revealed an approach to politics that joins imaginative policy ideas with a keen instinct for mass communication and a willingness to negotiate. On one hand, she marshaled support from progressive activists and helped build public demand for her idea; on the other, she haggled with members of Congress to earn their backing. David Axelrod, who was Mr. Obama’s top political adviser during the battle to create the C.F.P.B., called Ms. Warren’s role a “bona fide credential” for the presidency. “There aren’t that many people who can say they had an idea, wrote about it and ended up bringing it to fruition, in terms of the creation of a whole new government agency with a very focused mission,” Mr. Axelrod said. If some of Ms. Warren’s rivals — and more than a few Democratic voters — question whether her ideas are realistic, she and her supporters answer by pointing to the consumer bureau. At the New Hampshire Democratic Party’s convention this month, supporters of Ms. Warren broke out in chants of, “C-F-P-B! She fights for you, she fights for me!” In a recent interview, Ms. Warren described the creation of the bureau as a “model” for how she would seek to deploy her plans as president. At  a September rally  in Washington Square Park in New York, Ms. Warren likened herself to Frances Perkins, the first secretary of labor — a woman, she said, “who worked the political system relentlessly from the inside, while a sustained movement applied pressure from the outside.” But if the bureau has been an enduring victory for Ms. Warren, it culminated in a painful disappointment.  In the interview, Ms. Warren — an upbeat presence on the campaign trail — became somber when the conversation turned to her exit from the bureau. Asked about her insistence against having a farewell party, her eyes began to  glisten .  “I couldn’t say goodbye to all those people I’d hired and all those people I’d brought in to fight,” Ms. Warren said, speaking slowly and quietly. “I’d made an implicit promise to lead the charge, and I would’ve stayed and led it if I could have. But I couldn’t. And I did not want to say goodbye to all of them.” Ms. Warren’s band of advisers, lawyers, researchers and technicians devised a more discreet send-off. Elizabeth Vale, a former White House official who was among Ms. Warren’s close counselors, said an immense farewell card was made from a “big, big, big piece of cardboard,” stamped with the electric-green logo of the C.F.P.B. and signed by scores of staff members. Still, Ms. Warren, then 62, declined to receive it before a throng of colleagues. “I remember two of us brought it to her,” Ms. Vale said, “and then I remember when she walked out, she just walked out quietly, by herself.” An Idea About Exploding Toasters It all began with Ms. Warren’s decision to write an article in the winter of 2007. She had endured one unhappy brush with Washington, testifying against a bill to tighten the bankruptcy code in a way she feared would burden low-income debtors. The proposal became law in 2005, with Joseph R. Biden Jr., then a senator, as its leading Democratic supporter. Back at Harvard,  where she was teaching law, Ms. Warren began considering a new idea: a proposal for a government regulator to address the issue on which Congress had spurned her advice — the problem of consumer credit and the often-deceptive financial products being offered to ordinary people. She outlined the concept to Kenneth Baer, then 34, a former Clinton administration aide who with several like-minded Democrats had founded a publication, Democracy, to stir an ambitious policy debate among liberals. He was skeptical at first of Ms. Warren’s regulatory proposal, wondering if forming a new government agency represented an “old Democratic way of thinking.” But Mr. Baer and his colleagues were hungry for big ideas to fill what they saw as an intellectual void in the Democratic Party, and he encouraged her to make the case for a new regulator. In a February email to Mr. Baer, Ms. Warren agreed to write it. As she tells it now, she was bursting for the chance. “The idea was ripe,” she said. “I was ready.” A draft of the piece followed in late March. Ms. Warren urged her collaborators to “edit aggressively,” an instruction that proved unnecessary. A copy of her first version reviewed by a reporter shows its now-famous opening was scarcely  changed . “In the U.S. today it is not possible to buy a toaster that has a 1-in-5 chance of bursting into flames and burning down a customer’s house,” Ms. Warren wrote in her draft. “But it is possible to refinance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same 1-in-5 chance of putting the family out on the street — without ever disclosing that  fac t to the homeowner.” When Democracy published Ms. Warren’s article in the summer of 2007, Mr. Baer and his colleagues promoted it — and its author — vigorously, booking Ms. Warren on CNN and winning coverage for her idea in national newspapers. And they promoted it to presidential campaigns, too. A breakthrough came in June when Heather McGhee, a policy adviser to Senator John Edwards, emailed Ms. Warren to say her candidate was about to endorse a new regulator for financial products. By early 2008, Ms. Warren and her sometime editors were musing over email that the proposal could really become law. When Ms. Warren noted praise for her idea in Newsweek, Andrei Cherny, a co-founder of Democracy, wrote back, “Next stop: law of the land!” “I’m working on it!” Ms. Warren replied, signing off with her initials, EW, in lowercase. It had been decades since either political party had tried seriously to impose tougher financial regulations. Even sympathetic Democrats, like Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, questioned the feasibility. Ms. McGhee, who stayed in touch with Ms. Warren after the Edwards campaign ended, said she saw the professor straining to discern what to do and whom to turn to in Washington. “She really was trying to figure out how to have all the right conversations,” Ms. McGhee said. “And then the financial crisis happened.” A Two-Sided Game The Congressional Oversight Panel, a body set up to scrutinize Washington’s bailout of the financial system, did not mention toasters in its “special report” on financial regulation. But the document, issued days after Mr. Obama’s inauguration in 2009, was unmistakable in its suggestion. The report recommended creating a financial regulator that could gather up the fragmented enforcement tools of the federal government and seek to avert another financial crisis. It was a natural suggestion for the oversight body, since Ms. Warren was its chairwoman.  Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader at the time, had named her to the post at the end of 2008, in the throes of a global financial catastrophe that sent unemployment soaring and threw millions of homeowners into foreclosure. From this perch, Ms. Warren began a campaign for her bureau. It was no longer a lonely effort. Mr. Frank, a powerful committee chairman, was now an ally. So was an emerging coalition of progressive groups, labor unions and consumer advocates, known as Americans for Financial Reform. Ms. Warren sought out its leader, Heather Booth, for insight into political organizing. “She knew many of the players on the policy side,” Ms. Booth said. “What she hadn’t been experienced with were the politics.” Ms. Warren also built alliances inside government, finding friends in people like Mr. Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett, one of Mr. Obama’s closest advisers. Mr. Axelrod saw the bureau as a political necessity, the one part of financial reform ordinary voters might understand. At times, Ms. Warren’s appeals were strikingly personal: Over dinner in Cambridge, Mass., Ms. Warren told Ms. Jarrett much of the life story that is now familiar to voters who follow her campaign, a tale of deep economic adversity for her family in Oklahoma. “It put in context why this policy was so important to her,” Ms. Jarrett said. Mr. Obama embraced the proposal, putting a consumer bureau in his blueprint for financial reform in the spring of 2009 and talking on late-night television about exploding toasters. Ms. Warren was elated but uneasy. The financial industry was mobilizing, warning that a new regulator would damage the economic recovery. And Ms. Warren was concerned about two of Mr. Obama’s lieutenants: Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, who helmed the National Economic Council. She had profound philosophical disagreements with both men, who believed that her savage criticism of the bank bailouts revealed a misunderstanding of the role of Wall Street in the fragile economic recovery. “Tim and Larry were not fans of this agency,” Ms. Warren said. “I heard more than once from Senate and House staffers that they had proposed scrapping it in return for some other concession that they cared more about.” Of Mr. Obama, she said: “I never worried about the president. I was worried about his advisers.” Mr. Obama remained forcefully supportive and senior officials at the Treasury Department helped negotiate the shape of the bureau at every stage. In the House, Ms. Warren blessed deals struck by Mr. Frank, including one exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from certain new regulatory requirements. The concession was intended to win over an influential trade group, the Independent Community Bankers of America, and its chief lobbyist, Cam Fine. The arrangement dismayed the left — until Ms. Warren endorsed it. “She was very realistic,” Mr. Frank said. “She was deeply engaged in talking to members and she did acquire her own sense of what was politically doable.” Ms. Warren had less influence in the Senate, where Democrats held the majority but their ability to break a filibuster hinged on centrist legislators. So Ms. Warren turned her attention beyond the chamber, rallying activists and talking to the media. In her most provocative move,  she told HuffPost  that the Senate must either create a “strong consumer agency” or have “no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor.” “That,” Ms. Warren said recently, “is the outsider’s game.” The Senate ultimately approved a bureau that was stronger in some ways than Ms. Warren’s 2007 proposal. Instead of a Financial Products Safety Commission, led by committee, it would be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, headed by a single director. And it would draw funding from the Federal Reserve, putting its budget beyond reach of adversaries in Congress. Ms. Warren attended the July 2010 ceremony where Mr. Obama signed the Dodd-Frank bill into law, and with it a consumer bureau that he asked her to help set up. He designated her an aide to himself and to Mr. Geithner, with a mandate to build the regulator she had devised on paper in 2007. There was no promise she would become the permanent director. If Ms. Warren had won a landmark policy victory, it came at the cost of making enemies in Congress and the administration. While Mr. Geithner would criticize business groups for opposing the consumer bureau in a 2014 book, he also cast Ms. Warren as an implacable critic of the bank rescue, more focused on “made-for-YouTube” grandstanding than on crafting practical ideas. He and Mr. Summers described her in White House meetings as unreasonably hostile to financial institutions, and as simply unreasonable. “You cannot play the role she was playing without making people mad at you,” said former Representative Brad Miller, a North Carolina Democrat involved in drafting Dodd-Frank. He said of the Obama economic team, “Those were folks who were used to getting their own way and not having to deal with critics at all.” Mr. Geithner, now president of the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed. Mr. Summers, who has criticized some of Ms. Warren’s 2020 campaign proposals, did not respond to interview requests. But Ms. Warren at times unnerved others in the administration. In a 2015 memoir, Mr. Axelrod wrote that Mr. Obama grew frustrated in 2010 with Ms. Warren’s assertive efforts to position herself to become director — a possibility he feared would enrage banks and doom the Dodd-Frank bill. “Tell her to keep her mouth shut,” Mr. Obama said, according to Mr. Axelrod’s book. “She may well be the choice, but we can’t surface that now.” ‘That Was Her Job’ In the spring of 2011, Mr. Fine, the lobbyist for community banks, got a call from Ms. Jarrett. If the White House selected Ms. Warren to lead the consumer bureau, she asked, would he fight for her confirmation? Mr. Fine said he would. A few days later, Ms. Warren told Mr. Fine over lunch in downtown Washington that the White House had decided against nominating her. “I said: ‘That’s just not right. Do you want me to start a campaign? Do you want me to demand a meeting over at the White House?’” said Mr. Fine, whose offers Ms. Warren declined. “She put on a brave face.” For Ms. Warren, this setback came at the end of a whirlwind year setting up the bureau. Since Dodd-Frank became law, Ms. Warren had traveled widely and hired aggressively. Eager to show her organization was at work, she demanded swift, visible actions, like the creation of a complaint hotline with a public catalog of Americans’ grievances against banks and other lenders. Her recruitment efforts had established the bureau as a political force, as well as a legal one. The staff swelled, and weekly meetings shifted from a modest conference room to an elevator-studded lobby. In a pair of public-relations coups, Ms. Warren asked Holly Petraeus, a Better Business Bureau official married to a renowned general, to lead the Office of Servicemember Affairs, and enlisted Mr. Cordray, the outgoing attorney general of Ohio, to lead her enforcement division.  “As she put it to me: It’s a chance to do on a nationwide basis what you’re doing in Ohio, with more tools, more authority to pursue the banks,” Mr. Cordray said, recalling Ms. Warren’s pitch. It was a chance, in other words, to wield great power. But Ms. Warren would soon learn that hers was borrowed power — power delegated by the president, and for only a year. By the spring of 2011, the opposition to Ms. Warren becoming permanent director was unbending. Republican senators said they would never confirm her; so did Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, a conservative Democrat. Mr. Nelson, who is supporting Mr. Biden in the Democratic primary, said in an interview that he worried about empowering someone he saw as a champion of “runaway government.” “I was very concerned about somebody who had been such a strong advocate for a government bureau that had virtually no control,” Mr. Nelson said. Mr. Reid said Republican opposition sealed Ms. Warren’s fate. “The Republicans stopped her from getting that job,” he said. “That was her job.” Among some of Ms. Warren’s allies, frustration lingers about what happened in 2011. They blame not just Republicans, but also her rivals in the Obama administration and a harsh strain of sexism directed at her by political opponents and the media. “Men never get this adjective, ‘strident.’ That bothers me, because I don’t think she is,” Ms. Petraeus said. “Yes, she’s passionate. She doesn’t hesitate to call somebody out, especially on the Hill, if they’re trying to serve up a bunch of double-dealing nonsense.” Sheila Bair, a Warren ally who was then at the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,  said she had been angry to learn the White House was leaning against nominating Ms. Warren. Her detractors in the administration, Ms. Bair said, had been “whispering behind the scenes that she couldn’t get confirmed.” “Even if that is true, fight it out,” Ms. Bair said. In the end, Mr. Obama concluded Mr. Cordray stood a better chance of clearing the Senate. Republicans would stonewall his nomination until 2013. It was Ms. Jarrett who called to inform Ms. Warren. She also suggested an alternative path forward: running for Senate. “She was not overly enthusiastic in our first call, because she never saw herself as a politician,” Ms. Jarrett said, “and I said I thought that’s the reason she’d be perfect for the job.” Others in the administration, including Mr. Geithner’s aides, saw the Senate race as a way to get Ms. Warren out of the executive branch. Mr. Miller, the former congressman, said he emailed Ms. Warren to warn that her critics might be trying to lure her “into a race that she could not win.” But in September 2011, Ms. Warren entered the race against Senator Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts, starting down a path that has led with improbable speed to a presidential campaign. Her candidacy today resembles a vastly enlarged version of the movement that gave rise to the consumer bureau. In a campaign framed as a crusade of ideas, Ms. Warren has vowed to restructure the economy as president using the same methods that helped make her imagined agency a real structure of concrete and glass. It is not lost on Ms. Warren that, had she become the director, it is unlikely she would be a leading presidential candidate now. “I would have stayed,” she said, “and done it forever.”"

"The vote was 421 to 0 with two lawmakers voting present. House Democrats announced plans to vote on the resolution Tuesday -- the same day that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced  a formal impeachment inquiry  -- in the wake of outrage over reports that the President pressured a foreign leader in an effort to target a political rival. It was not clear until late in the day on Wednesday when the complaint would be transmitted to the Hill, if at all.  The resolution, from House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, calls for the complaint to be turned over to the congressional intelligence committees. The vote took place just hours after the White House released a transcript showing that President Donald Trump  repeatedly pushed  for Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, during a July 25 phone call. CNN  has previously reported  that the call was part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General.  There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. The whistleblower complaint about Trump's communications with Ukraine was hand delivered Wednesday afternoon to Capitol Hill for lawmakers to review. Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that he has started to read the document, but declined to give his initial thoughts. Members of the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee are also reviewing the documents. It's not just Democrats who have vowed to find out the details of the whistleblower complaint.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  said  on Tuesday ""we're going to find out what happened"" with respect to the complaint and said that he expects the Senate Intelligence Committee will conduct a ""responsible, rather apolitical, at least bipartisan"" probe of the matter. On Tuesday, the Senate also adopted by unanimous consent its own resolution authored by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer urging the administration to provide the full complaint to Congress. Earlier on Wednesday ahead of the final vote on the resolution, the House adopted an amendment to its resolution offered by Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania to make it identical to the resolution passed the day before by the Senate.  Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced the vote on the resolution on Tuesday, saying in a joint statement that ""the House will vote on a resolution making it clear Congress's disapproval of the Administration's effort to block the release of the complaint and the need to protect the whistleblower.""  House Democratic caucus chair Hakeem Jeffries said at a news conference on Wednesday morning that the resolution would demand the release of ""the full and unredacted version"" of the complaint.

"Juan Williams reacts to Biden case, Trump-Ukraine transcript Juan Williams  rejected conservatives' claims that the Trump-Ukraine situation should be an opportunity to probe the Biden family over unsubstantiated allegations involving business dealings rather than look at the president's troubling July phone call with Kiev's new leader. Williams responded Tuesday on "" The Five "" to previously aired comments by Karl Rove -- who claimed Democrats walked themselves into a place where the current 2020 Democratic frontrunner,  former Vice President Joe Biden , could be ""hurt ... badly."" ""The big cloud here to today is 'whataboutism' and an attempt to try to drag Joe Biden and Hunter Biden ... in here so we can distract you from what is going on with the news and President Trump,"" Williams insisted. BIDEN CAMPAIGN LIKELY COMING TO AN END -- THANKS TO CLINTON-LINKED UKRAINE BOMBSHELL, NUNES SAYS ""He can be impeached and I do not think the president wanted this,"" Williams added, calling the White House's decision to release the transcript of a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian Presiden Volodymyr Zelensky a ""tremendous mistake."" In addition, Williams pointed to  an op-ed  from Reps. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., and five other freshman Dems that expressed joint support for an impeachment inquiry. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He said the change showed growing support among the moderate wing of the Democratic Party for the president to be investigated. Earlier this week, Trump called the Biden father and son ""corrupt"" and slammed media ""double standards"" over what he claimed was the failure of the press to report on allegations of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden related to dealings with Kiev. “Joe Biden and his son are corrupt, but the fake news doesn’t want to report because they’re Democrats,” Trump said in New York during United Nations meetings. “If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair.”"
"It was the furthest Biden has gone on the subject of  Trump's impeachment  -- which most of the other leading 2020 Democratic presidential contenders have called for.  Asked how the matter ranks on the ""outlandish scale"" of American politics, Biden said: ""18 out of 10.""  Biden's comments came the day the White House  released a transcript of a July 25 call  between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  Trump on Wednesday denied any wrongdoing, saying there was ""no pressure whatsoever"" in his phone call with Zelensky. The call prompted a whistleblower to file a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday said the Democratic-controlled House would begin a formal impeachment inquiry.  Biden called Trump's actions ""such a blatant abuse of power that I don't think it can stand.""  ""The idea that someone would call a head of a foreign state, ahead of time withhold significant military aid that's badly needed in order to prevent the Russian separatists who are in Ukraine, from taking over Ukraine, and then ask basically can you cooperate with Rudy Giuliani -- he's coming over,"" Biden said. He also criticized Trump for ""getting the Justice Department engaged in this.""  Kimmel asked if Trump committed an impeachable offense.  ""Based on the material they acknowledged today, it seems to me it's awful hard to avoid the conclusion that it is an impeachable offense. And a violation of constitutional responsibility,"" Biden said.  Still, Biden said he would remain focused on the 2020 election, rather than impeachment proceedings on Capitol Hill.  ""I'm confident in the ability of the House and Senate to deal with this,"" he said. ""My job is to just out and flat beat him. What I can't let happen I can't let this distract me in a way that takes me away from the issues that really are the reason why I'm running."" "
"Trump, Biden clash over whistleblower claims; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' all-star panel. Democratic Rep. Al Green  had a dire warning for his Democratic colleagues on Monday, suggesting that they will suffer the consequences at the ballot box if they don't impeach  President Trump . The impeachment debate was renewed last week after a ""whistleblower"" raised an issue about a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during which the president reportedly attempted to leverage financial aid in exchange for an investigation into Hunter Biden, son of  former Vice President Joe Biden . The Texas lawmaker, who was one of the first on Capitol Hill to push for impeachment, continued his efforts at a pro-impeachment rally. ""If we don’t do this rather quickly, the public is going to turn on us,"" Green  told the crowd . ""And we are going to find that those who went to the polls and gave us this great majority are going to be very disappointed. They are not going to side with us when we did not side with them."" REP. AL GREEN FEARS TRUMP 'WILL GET REELECTED' IF HE'S NOT IMPEACHED Last month,  Green blasted the president , calling him ""unfit"" and ""unworthy"" to serve as commander-in-chief. ""To defeat him at the polls would do history a disservice, would do our nation a disservice, and would not allow us to do what they did in 1868 when Andrew Johnson, who was the bigot of his time, who was impeached by the radical Republicans,""  Green  said.  ""We can’t let him walk the Earth without that stain... He’s caused harm to society. We need to do something about it.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Green also  expressed his concern  earlier this year that Trump would be reelected if Congress didn't impeach him. ""I'm concerned that if we don't impeach the president, he will get re-elected,"" Green said. ""If we don't impeach him, he will say that he has been vindicated, he will say the Democrats had an overwhelming majority in the House and they didn't take up impeachment. He will say that we had a constitutional duty to do it if it was there and we didn't. He will say that he has been vindicated."""
"'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the battle between President Trump and the mainstream media as the Ukraine story evolves. With Nancy Pelosi finally bowing to Democratic pressure and launching a formal impeachment inquiry, many in the media may be getting their wish. After all, many pundits, especially on the left, longed for the same outcome during the Russia investigation, only to be bitterly disappointed. But the Ukraine uproar has a far simpler story line than the complicated Russia probe. And it proved a tipping point for the House speaker, who has long believed that impeachment could boomerang on the Democrats without ultimately ousting Trump, who she sees as highly vulnerable in 2020. But with 175 of her members, including some moderates, hopping on the impeachment bandwagon, Pelosi could no longer stem the tide. HOW TRUMP AND ALLIES ARE SHIFTING THE UKRAINE SPOTLIGHT TO BIDEN In a flag-bedecked speech, Pelosi said Trump’s actions on Ukraine “have seriously violated the Constitution,” that he “must be held accountable,” and announcing an “official” investigation by a half-dozen committees. As strange as it sounds, Pelosi’s reluctant move could in some ways help Trump, because it shifts the terms of debate. Trump’s preferred mode of defense is to go on offense—whether it’s against Crooked Hillary, Mueller’s angry Democrats or Sleepy Joe’s alleged transgressions. It’s all about demonizing the other side, just as the left does to Trump. Especially after his planned release today of a transcript of his July call with Ukraine’s leader, the president and his allies can argue that even if he went too far in bringing up Joe Biden with a foreign leader, it does not warrant the drastic remedy of impeachment. He’s already called it “witch hunt garbage,” and will undoubtedly cast it as one perpetrated by his enemies in the opposition party, the press and the Deep State. He can energize his supporters, who will see their hero in danger of being forced from office. And the resulting fireworks will not only obliterate any semblance of a Democratic agenda, it will overshadow what Biden, Bernie, Elizabeth and the rest are doing on the trail. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Trump asked, not unreasonably, how Pelosi could take this step without even having seen the details of the phone call. Outside the hothouse of the media and political world, I don’t sense that Ukraine has quite reached the level of a political earthquake. And that, for the moment, has the president’s critics baffled. I believe the media coverage is a key factor, as I’ll explain in a moment. But first, there’s no doubt that the  Washington Post  moved the ball with a report that Trump told his acting chief of staff “to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which Trump is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, according to three senior administration officials.” The piece says that OMB officials relayed Trump’s order to State and the Pentagon, and were ordered to give members of Congress no explanation beyond that the delay was part of an “interagency process.” The story also quoted Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy as saying that Ukrainian President Zelensky told him during a visit this month that the aid was cut off as a “consequence” of his unwillingness to launch a probe of the Bidens. (The money has since been released.) The president did not deny the story but shifted his explanation, saying he held up the money because he wanted Europe to pay more for Ukraine’s defense. He also scoffed at the notion of impeachment before his speech at the U.N., telling reporters: “What Joe Biden did for his son, that’s something they should be looking at.” The  New York Times’  Peter Baker reported yesterday morning that Trump now seems to be saying, as the headline puts it, “So What If I Did?” The piece calls this “an astonishing breach of the norms governing the American presidency…If anything, the president has grown even more defiant since Mr. Mueller found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, almost as if having avoided charges, he is daring the establishment to come after him again. The man who once said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan without consequence seems to be testing whether he can do the political equivalent.” With more House Democrats coming out for impeachment—more than two-thirds of Nancy Pelosi’s caucus is now in that camp—the question of whether Ukraine is a dramatic tipping point looms large. My sense is that there’s a fatigue factor for Trump scandals. And besides the president and Rudy Giuliani trying to shift the spotlight to the Bidens, as I wrote yesterday, the media coverage of the last few years is coloring the current climate. Take the Bob Mueller probe. While I’ve always argued the Russia investigation was a legitimately big story that led to several high-level indictments, can anyone really dispute that the coverage was so histrionic as to be misleading? The constant drumbeat was so relentless and so negative that it seemed only a matter of time before Trump was run out of town. Every minor development was cranked up to 11. And while the final report contained disturbing material, it also found no evidence that Trump actively cooperated with Russian operatives or hackers, and Mueller’s halting testimony was the final nail in the coffin. When the media fixated for more than a week on Sharpie-gate—and yes, Trump fueled the coverage with daily blasts about his handling of the hurricane—it was another case of runaway hype. The same was true in episode after episode: Porn stars! Michael Cohen! S-hole countries! Omarosa! Tax returns! Greenland! Go back where they came from! Rat-infested Baltimore! Most of these controversies were very real, sometimes troubling, and yet trumpeted with a this-time-he’s-gone-too-far tone until each story faded. Trump’s constant pushback against the “fake news media,” and his attacks on Democrats and “witch hunt” investigators, added to the feeling that these were nothing more than partisan brawls. In other words, journalists are suffering from boy-who-cried-wolf syndrome. Now that they have extremely serious allegations to pursue, the ensuing uproar sounds too much like so many other scandals and mini-scandals that, fairly or unfairly, didn’t move the needle. There’s also an emerging theory, argued for some time by the Federalist’s Ben Domenech, that Trump wants to be impeached. Ross Douthat, the conservative, anti-Trump  New York Times  columnist, expanded on this view yesterday: “If the Democrats impeach him they will be doing something unpopular instead of something popular… the likely Democratic nominees are all more popular than Trump, and so anything that puts the Democrats on the wrong side of public opinion may look better, through Trump’s eyes, than the status quo… “Trump is happy to pit his overt abuses of power against the soft corruption of his foes. This is an aspect of Trumpism that the president’s critics find particularly infuriating — the way he attacks his rivals for being corrupt swamp creatures while being so much more nakedly compromised himself.” Whether or not you agree that he did something wrong, he excels at these dual-corruption debates, that it’s the other side that should face prison terms. No president, not even Donald Trump, wants to be impeached. But if past journalistic excesses help convince the public that the Ukraine story is just more exaggeration, and if the press is viewed as a pro-impeachment movement, Trump will paint the media as helping the Democrats try to end his term.

"A tractor trailer overturned on I-95 in Newark, Delaware, forcing the highway to be closed in both directions,  according to the Delaware Department of Transportation . The accident was south of the Biden Welcome Center, which was  renamed in honor of Biden and his family last year  for their service to the state.  Biden delivered remarks to the event over speakerphone, apologizing for not being able to make it. ""We were on time heading down to see you all and there was a major, major accident. A tractor trailer overturned, we later learned. We sat there for about 40, 45 minutes -- maybe longer,"" he said, according to a pool report. The Democratic presidential candidate was traveling from an event in Wilmington, Delaware, where he  made his most direct statement to date on impeachment.  The former vice president said Tuesday that if President Donald Trump does not cooperate with Congress, he would leave lawmakers with ""no choice"" but to start impeachment proceedings. In his remarks to the fundraiser, Biden said Trump is attacking him because he presents a formidable challenge to the President's reelection prospects and reiterated his support for holding him accountable. ""But if we allow a president to get away with shredding the United States Constitution, this is going to last forever. This goes well beyond me. This is a national problem. This isn't a Democratic problem. This isn't a Republican problem. If I dropped out tomorrow, the fact is we can't let this happen,"" Biden said. Shortly after Biden made his comments,  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump , a dramatic and historic move that comes as Trump faces outrage over reports that he pressured a foreign leader in an effort to target a political rival.

"Fox News’ Deroy Murdock gives his insights on Democrats’ impeachment plans and how the Trump administration has reacted. The roaring controversy over President Trump, former Vice President  Joe Biden , and their respective actions toward Ukraine sorely lacks some key language: the word “extortion” and the phrase “obstruction of justice.” In March 2016, then-Vice President Biden told  Ukraine’s  then-President Petro Poroshenko that the Eastern European nation would not get a $1 billion U.S. government loan guarantee unless it fired Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma Holdings — a natural gas extraction company whose board of directors included Hunter Biden, the veep’s son. Shokin told The Hill’s John Solomon that plans for his probe “included interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board,  including Hunter Biden .” WH TO RELEASE DOCUMENT SHOWING INTEL COMMUNITY WATCHDOG FOUND WHISTLEBLOWER HAD 'POLITICAL BIAS,' OFFICIAL SAY S Hunter Biden reportedly earned  some $50,000 per month  for his services, although he had no expertise in gas production and didn’t know Ukraine from Utah. He was experienced, however, in being the son of the vice president of the United States who, as luck would have it, “was serving as the Obama administration’s point man on relations with Ukraine and  rooting out bureaucratic corruption ,” according to the Wall Street Journal. Joe Biden must have been aware of Hunter’s term on Burisma’s board. Indeed, major news organizations raised serious questions about this arrangement. “Hunter Biden’s new job at Ukrainian gas company is a problem for U.S. soft power,” read a May 14, 2014,  Washington Post headline . And a June 8, 2014  Fox News story  was headlined: “Ukraine energy firm hiring Biden’s son raises ethical concerns” Joe Biden discussed his March 2016 showdown with Poroshenko in remarks before the Council on Foreign Relations, of which I am a member, on January 23, 2018. “I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee,” the former vice president explained about his mission to Kiev, per the CFR’s transcript. “And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from [then-Prime Minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn’t.” “I said, ‘I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars,’” Biden continued. “I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours.’ I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours.  If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money .’ Well, son of a b----. (Laughter.) He got fired.” Biden’s actions reek of extortion and obstruction of justice. And President Trump is the bad guy? Also, the allegation that Trump pressured Ukraine’s current president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Biden’s behavior supposedly is based on the complaint of a mysterious whistleblower. However, it now transpires that this supposed whistleblower is not an eyewitness or even an earwitness to the Trump-Zelensky conversation. So, rather than a whistleblower, or perhaps a dog whistle, this entire fandango — including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s just-announced impeachment inquiry — is fueled by merely an echo of a whistle. In other words, hearsay. Conversely, Biden’s incriminating words were neither overheard nor just transcribed. In fact, he said this on camera at  an on-the-record CFR meeting .  Video tape exists  of Biden boasting about securing the dismissal of the man who was probing his son’s possible graft. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER So, apparently it’s a potentially impeachable offense for President Trump to raise Biden’s possible obstruction of justice in a conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky, which Kiev’s Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko called “long, friendly” and “ no pressure .” Meanwhile, it’s perfectly OK that the former vice president, as he personally crowed, blackmailed then-President Poroshenko into firing the top prosecutor who was investigating Hunter Biden’s possible graft. Successfully sacking one’s son’s prosecutor via extortion: This is the textbook definition of obstruction of justice.

"The media is trying to protect 2020 presidential contender  Joe Biden  from scrutiny over his son's business dealings in  Ukraine , Fox News host Mark Levin said Monday on  ""Hannity"" . ""You have a massive Democrat scandal here and that's why the media is conducting themselves the way they are. That's why the Democrats are trying to turn this inside-out. To immunize Biden and to attack Trump, but it won't work,"" he argued, accusing Biden of obstructing justice while he was vice president to protect his son and a future presidential bid. Hunter Biden had been investigated related to his ties to a Ukrainian energy company. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE' Biden said in the past that the  U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden’s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AMID BOMBSHELL REPORTS TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE AID Levin scoffed at the media's reporting about a whistleblower who reported President Trump had exerted pressure on the president of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, possibly holding up a military package for Ukraine, as well. He said he's ""sick and tired"" of the president's conversations with foreign leaders being leaked to the media and to Democrats. ""I don't remember a damn one of those happening to Obama or any other president. Our president has to be able to speak to other heads of state without this kind of tyranny taking place!"" he said.

The Trump administration  pushed back Tuesday  in the wake of multiple reports that the White House froze millions in aid to Ukraine shortly before Trump pressured the country's leader to  investigate  Joe Biden and his son. The reports coincided with a renewed round of calls, including from more centrist Democrats, for a formal impeachment inquiry. Those calls came a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she is opening the door to that route if the administration continues to withhold a whistleblower complaint apparently related to  Trump's Ukraine  discussions.

"""Nothing came to me,"" Coats said Tuesday during an appearance at the Economic Club of Indiana,  according to The Indianapolis Star.  ""I left on August 15. ... The very next day that was presented to Joe (Maguire). I feel so bad for Joe. He is caught in a squeeze here and the lawyers are divided. So they are trying to work all that out. That's about all I can say about that."" Maguire has faced immediate scrutiny in his role after the Office of the Director of National Intelligence refused to comply with a deadline to hand over the whistleblower complaint to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which had been deemed by the intelligence community inspector general to be ""credible and urgent."" The whistleblower complaint deals, at least in part, with a phone call Trump had in July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Friday, CNN reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation.  On the day of Trump's call with Zelensky, word began to spread that Trump was reviewing a plan to cut foreign assistance to Ukraine. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either  Joe or Hunter Biden. Coats said that ""there's much I can't say"" about the situation, adding, ""We're in the secrets business ... obviously there are a number of things going on relative to that and you've been reading about it in the paper and there's speculation."" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff announced Tuesday that the whistleblower who filed the complaint would like to speak to the committee. The whistleblower has requested guidance from Maguire on how to do so, Schiff said. ""We have been informed by the whistleblower's counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI as to how to do so,"" Schiff tweeted. ""We're in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower's testimony as soon as this week,"" he added."
"""We don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,"" Trump told reporters in describing the call. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.) And Monday, sources told CNN that White House officials are considering releasing a transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky.    Now  House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Adam Schiff , normally reticent about impeachment, says that if a whistleblower complaint that was revealed last week shows Trump tying military aid to Ukraine to Ukraine probing the Bidens, ""we may very well have crossed the Rubicon"" on impeachment. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi spoke of ""a grave new chapter in lawlessness."" Trump's administration has already intervened to keep secret the whistleblower complaint that appears to be related to Ukraine -- thereby blocking the normal process that would inform Congress of the controversy.  And in doing so, he has aligned himself more closely with the tragic example of Richard Nixon, who resigned as Congress accused him of high crimes and misdemeanors. Trump made his regard for Nixon plain to me when, during a 2014 stroll around his office, he paused to pick up a framed letter. The note, signed in blue by the disgraced former President, urged Trump to go into politics. Trump told me he admired Nixon because he was such a good judge of talent. In my time with Trump, as I gathered research for a biography of him, he criticized Obama, both Presidents Bush, as well as Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, but he never said a bad word about Tricky Dick who, it must be said, spent a troubling amount of time on the dark side of politics.  Nixon's ""dirty tricksters,"" among them longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone -- who faces trial in November on charges of lying to Congress and obstructing justice -- worked with a level of creative malevolence that a manipulator like Trump would surely admire. But it was Nixon's hubris, combined with his lies, that proved his undoing. In Trump we hear echoes. Our current President's lies and misstatements are legion. The  current Washington Post count exceeds 12,000 . His hubris was on display during the 2016 campaign when he said he could ""stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone"" and not lose any votes. In office Trump has lived by the same heedless attitude, axing aides -- often for insufficient loyalty -- at a furious rate and turning the federal government into a Trump Tower on the Potomac, where one man rules by his gut instinct. Of course, the chaos and subsequent ineptitude of the Trump regime separates him from Nixon, whose team was generally effective in administering the government. Nixon's creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and his opening of relations with China, for example, were accomplished because he had deep experience in government.  But one of the impeachment articles that brought down Richard Nixon -- perhaps the most important one -- cited his refusal to release tapes of conversations that he had secretly recorded in the Oval Office. First revealed by White House aide Alexander Butterfield, the tapes proved Nixon's involvement in the Watergate cover-up and made it impossible for him to deny the truth. Here the comparison with Trump becomes, for the moment, a question mark, since we don't know exactly how the discussion of the Bidens was framed in the phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  And now the President seems to be saying he wants to release a transcript of the call. At first glance this openness suggests a real break from the Nixon stonewalling model, but a glance through recent history suggests Trump may just be more adept than Nixon when it comes to doublespeak.  In his  comments Sunday  about the transcript, Trump said, ""We'll make a determination about how to release it, releasing it, saying what we said."" A casual listener would hear in Trump's words a desire to make the call transcript public. But that's not what he said.  In fact, he noted any release would be ""saying what we said,"" which leaves lots of room for editing. Trump also added that releasing the contents of the call would pose challenges to foreign leaders and that intelligence officials may block him from coming clean. Sunday, both his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and his Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, were dispatched to the morning talk shows to caution against the release: ""I think it would be highly inappropriate to release a transcript of a call between two world leaders,"" said Mnuchin. We have heard this sort of thing before. Trump said he wanted to release his tax returns, as every president has for decades, but that his  lawyers wouldn't let him . The same thing happened during the Mueller investigation, when Trump repeatedly said he wanted to sit for the special counsel's questions, but then he followed a strategy that prevented the meeting from ever happening. Take all the evidence into account and it's easy to see that, like Nixon, Trump's ignoble impulses -- his obfuscation, his self-dealing -- represent a threat to the country and to his own presidency. The difference is a matter of style. Trump is Nixon, but with far more chutzpah and far less respect for the nation's institutions. He represents a dangerous variation on a tragic type."
"'The View' co-host Joy Behar didn't hold back when commenting on President Trump's heavy criticism of freshmen Democratic congresswomen, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. It was a big day for corporate synergy on  ABC News ’ “The View” Monday when the network’s chief White House correspondent, Jonathan Karl, joined the daytime gabfest to explain  the controversy over a phone call  between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. For days, Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate 2020 hopeful Joe Biden’s family dealings – using military aid as leverage – and cited the reports to revive calls for the president's impeachment. GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN “Thank goodness Jonathan Karl is here,” co-host Whoopi Goldberg said after airing video of Trump’s explanation of the call. “What just happened?” Karl then explained that Trump admitted he talked about Biden directly with the Ukrainian president in July during a time that the United States was withholding aid money that Congress had already approved. NEW YORK TIMES DELETES 9/11 TWEET AFTER BACKLASH: 'AIRPLANES TOOK AIM AND BROUGHT DOWN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER' “We don’t know, was he pressuring?… was he suggesting?, we don’t know any of that,” Karl said before citing a Wall Street Journal report that Trump urged Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son. Karl then said there are people on Trump’s team urging him to release the transcript of the now-infamous phone call. Karl also said that if Joe Biden's son, Hunter, weren’t politically connected then he probably wouldn’t have been in a position to profit from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Hunter Biden, as far as I know, doesn’t have a lot of experience with Ukraine, I think if his name were Hunter Smith he probably wouldn’t have been getting paid,” Karl said. Co-host Meghan McCain then pointed out that reporters act like “the end of the world is coming” on a regular basis and asked Karl why this latest story was any different. “I think that this is significant and this is a little bit different and very easy to understand. You have what the president himself has already acknowledged, which is even if there was no quid pro quo, even if he wasn’t holding that aid over the head of the president of Ukraine, merely bringing up your political opponent in a conversation with a newly elected president, any president of a foreign country, is going to be seen as problematic,” Karl said. Fox News’ Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi delivers remarks following Democratic meeting on moving forward with impeachment proceedings. House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi,  D-Calif., announced the formalization of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump Tuesday evening, saying ""the president must be held accountable"" for his ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections."" The speaker effectively endorsed the process, which to some degree has  already been underway , after facing fresh pressure from inside the caucus to act. The move could help Democrats' disputed  arguments in court  that impeachment proceedings were in fact in progress, which could entitle Congress to obtain additional documents. Pelosi specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky . Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal."" Trump allegedly pushed Zelensky to  investigate  former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden  has acknowledged   on camera  that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm  Burisma Holdings  — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption. But there were several indicators throughout the day that Pelosi's gambit could backfire, as Republicans  predicted over the weekend. ""It is a colossal error."" Trump  vowed earlier Tuesday  to release a ""complete"" transcript of his call with  Zelensky  by Wednesday. Additionally, a senior administration official told Fox News late Tuesday that the White House is working as quickly as it can to release to Congress a whistleblower complaint, as long as it's legally possible. The official told Fox News that the White House had nothing to hide, that there has been no wrongdoing, The Wall Street Journal  reported  that the complaint must be declassified first, but will likely be in Congress' hands by the end of the week. And The New York Times  reported  that the White House had dropped its objection to the whistleblower speaking to Congress. That came after the GOP-controlled Senate passed a unanimous resolution seeking access to the whistleblower's complaint. WATCH BIDEN RECOUNT HOW HE PUSHED FOR SHOKIN'S FIRING Still, Pelosi appeared undeterred -- and she and other Democrats suggested to reporters that impeachment could be appropriate even for matters unrelated to the Ukraine probe. ""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella. ""The president must be held accountable,"" she continued. ""No one is above the law."" Invoking the ""darkest days of the American Revolution,"" Pelosi called on lawmakers to honor their constitutional oath to protect the country ""from all enemies, foreign and domestic."" The Democratic-led committees then would gather evidence and present it to Pelosi and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who would make the ultimate determination on whether to hold an impeachment vote. A Democratic source told Fox News that the House Intelligence Committee, led by California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, would take the lead in the investigation -- and that Nadler might not be pleased with the arrangement. “I don’t think he’s happy that he has less influence here, but everybody is on the same page and has the same role,” the source said of Nadler. Schiff “will have a heavy role here because the foundation of the Ukraine allegations is thorough his committee,"" the source said. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., responded to Pelosi's statement by noting that Democrats have been pushing to impeach Trump for years, for a variety of reasons. ""Nancy Pelosi may be Speaker of the House,"" McCarthy said, ""but she does not speak for America. ... What she said today made no difference in what's been going on. This election is over. It's time to put the public before politics."" Trump, for his part, ripped into Democrats in a series of  tweets  immediately after Pelosi's comments, writing that ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT"" was in progress again. ""Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage,"" Trump wrote. ""So bad for our Country!"" He added: ""They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!"" Trump is set to meet with Zelensky in New York on Wednesday. The visit was previously scheduled, unrelated to the whistleblower allegation, although the two leaders are expected to face questions about the matter from reporters. House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, called Democrats' efforts predictable and destructive in his own fiery statement. ""Democrats have been trying to impeach the President since the beginning of this Congress,"" Jordan said. ""Michael Cohen's testimony was a bust. John Dean's testimony was a waste of time. The Mueller report did not live up to the hype. ""Speaker Pelosi's decision to pursue impeachment now - on the basis of unsubstantiated, indirect, and anonymous allegations - only shows that the Speaker has finally succumbed to unrelenting pressure from the socialist wing of the Democrat Party,"" Jordan added. ""This was never about Russian collusion or Ukrainian prosecutions. It is all about undoing the 2016 election and the will of the American people."" Pelosi had met Tuesday afternoon with her caucus of House Democrats prior to giving the planned statement. Wary of  compromising  the electability of vulnerable Democrats in the caucus, Pelosi had long resisted taking the dramatic step publicly -- even though other top Democrats  have insisted , in  legal filings  and  the media , that an impeachment inquiry already has been in progress for months. Swing district Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., acknowledged to Fox News that supporting the impeachment inquiry ""could"" affect her electorally, but she maintained that Trump voters in her district ""understand,"" and that Trump crossed a red line. Republicans said the move would prove to be a major political mistake. TRUMP VOWS TO RELEASE TRANSCRIPT OF CALL WITH UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT ""It is a colossal error,"" Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn told Fox News just prior to Pelosi's comments. ""And, I’m kind of surprised that Speaker Pelosi, as shrewd as she is, would let it get to this point."" Pelosi's impeachment imprimatur came after a  flurry  of those swing-district Democrats late Monday wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post backing an impeachment inquiry, or a fact-finding look at whether an impeachment vote by the full House is warranted. And on Saturday night, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,  said  Democrats' failure to act on impeachment had been a ""national scandal."" Pelosi's decision Tuesday heartened Democrats who have long called for impeaching the president, only to be stalled after Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of Russian collusion by the Trump campaign. But, new momentum built quickly for the move after news of the whistleblower complaint surfaced.

       In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But, he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine  a ""disgrace,""  acknowledged that Biden had come up during the call and added: ""It's very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?"" BIDEN CAMPAIGN LIKELY TO END, AS UKRAINE ISSUE WILL 'BACKFIRE,' NUNES SAYS Trump tweeted Tuesday that he would make a ""complete"" transcript of his phone call public on Wednesday. ""I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,"" Trump wrote. ""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!"" Justice Department lawyers, as well as lawyers at the White House, have been advising White House officials to release the transcript since last week, a source familiar with the conversations told Fox News. At an  event Tuesday , Pelosi intimated that impeachment would remain on the table, regardless of what the transcript showed. Many conservatives charged that she was  moving the goalposts  and lowering expectations.

       ""We have many other, shall we say, candidates for impeachable offenses in terms of the Constitution, but this one is the most understandable by the public,"" Pelosi said, referring to the Ukraine phone call allegation. ""It's really important to know this: There is no requirement that there be a quid-pro-quo in the conversation."" Other prominent Democrats also seemingly said Trump should be impeached no matter what. ""The president has committed several impeachable offenses,"" Ocasio-Cortez told reporters after Pelosi's remarks on impeachment. In another indication that Democrats were apparently hedging their bets on the Ukraine matter, Ocasio-Cortez said alleged Emoluments Clause violations by the president could be included in prospective articles of impeachment. FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED Democrats continued to push for the whistleblower to testify and to see the full whistleblower complaint throughout the day.  Schiff, D-Calif., said Tuesday afternoon that testimony from the whistleblower might be imminent. ""We have been informed by the whistleblower’s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI [Director of National Intelligence] as to how to do so,"" Schiff said in a tweet. ""We‘re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week."" It was unclear if Acting DNI Joseph Maguire would provide that guidance. Maguire is expected to testify himself before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday -- but Maguire has refused to share some information, including the complaint. A  source familiar with the matter told Fox News this week  that the whistleblower had no firsthand knowledge of Trump's call with  Zelensky . Late Monday, attorneys for the whistleblower  released a statement  confirming Schiff's statement, and noting that they ""await a timely response from the Acting Director providing such guidance."" ""We support the bi-partisan, unanimous resolution passed by the Senate regarding our client’s lawful whistleblower complaint and call upon the Acting Director of National Intelligence to transmit the complete disclosure to the two Intelligence Oversight Committees,"" the lawyers noted. GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN As Pelosi met with her caucus, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, called for the Senate and House Intelligence Committees to immediately have access to the whistleblower complaint. The panels ""should be allowed to evaluate the complaint in a deliberate and bipartisan manner consistent with applicable statutes and processes in order to safeguard classified and sensitive information,"" Schumer asserted. Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., also released a joint statement Tuesday announcing an imminent resolution condemning the White House's failure to turn over all related documents to Congress. ""Allegations that the President of the United States sought to enlist a foreign government to interfere in our democratic process by investigating one of his political rivals – and may have used the withholding of Congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance days earlier as intimidation – are deeply alarming,"" Hoyer and Pelosi wrote. They demanded the whistleblower's protection, and for ""the Acting Director of National Intelligence [to] provide Congress the [whistleblower] complaint, as specified under the law, and all requests for documents and testimony relating to this allegation."" PENCE RIPS BIDEN OVER UKRAINE HYPOCRISY IN 'HANNITY' INTERVIEW Pelosi and Hoyer continued: ""On Wednesday, the House will vote on a resolution making it clear Congress’s disapproval of the Administration’s effort to block the release of the complaint and the need to protect the whistleblower. This is not a partisan matter, it’s about the integrity."" Meanwhile, Yahoo News  reported  that the GOP-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee had  written to the whistleblower's attorney, requesting a closed-door interview . The precise implications of Pelosi's shift on impeachment were unclear, given Democrats' previous rhetoric on the topic. Earlier this month, Hoyer contradicted some of his colleagues by insisting that Congress is not engaged in any kind of  ""impeachment inquiry""  -- before reversing course hours later in a ""clarifying"" press statement.

       Other top Democrats, including  Nadler , have insisted repeatedly in court and in public that an impeachment inquiry has been in progress. “It has been an impeachment inquiry,” Nadler has said. “What we are doing is clear. It has been very clear. It continues to be very clear."" But, when asked if he thought it was an impeachment inquiry, Hoyer initially responded with an emphatic “No.” Hoyer added: “I think the delineation ought to be whether or not they are considering a resolution of impeachment.” The  Justice Department , in court filings earlier this month, sought to block congressional Democrats' bid for secret grand jury material from the Mueller investigation by citing the confusion inside the caucus over whether or not they're pursuing an ""impeachment investigation."" ""The committee’s own description of its investigation makes clear that it is too far removed from any potential judicial proceeding to qualify,"" the DOJ said. A total of 172 House Democrats have now signaled strong support for an impeachment inquiry -- 235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with  one pro-impeachment independent . A majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. A highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Vice President Mike Pence would then take office in that scenario. ""The ironic thing is is that everything that our critics in the media are leveling at the president from this phone call, and leveling at our administration, everything that Democrats on Capitol Hill are running off and describing -- Vice President Joe Biden bragged about -- which was a quid-pro-quo -- withholding American aid in exchange for a specific action,"" Pence  told Fox News' ""Hannity""  on Monday. Fox News' Chad Pergram, Brooke Singman, Ronn Blitzer and Jake Gibson contributed to this report."
"To the Editor: So  far, so-called  “women’s issues,”  which are really everyone’s issues, have been missing from the debates. I want to see the candidates discuss: women’s reproductive health and freedom; the wage gap; domestic violence; the #MeToo movement; body shaming; underrepresentation on boards, in corporate upper management, in academia and in STEM fields; child care availability; and widespread cultural misogyny. After all, we do make up more than half the population.  Diane Kravif Los Angeles To the Editor: International  relations  have been consistently ignored. President Trump has seriously disrupted longstanding treaty commitments, agreements and positive relationships with many of our allies, while fawning over dictators. The United States is perceived as unreliable and untrustworthy. How would the candidates improve our foreign relations? Jeanne Pierrette Dross Albany  To the Editor: Having  lost a son to heroin use, I want to ask the following of the candidates: Our “war on drugs,” declared by President Nixon  in 1971 , is a dismal failure. The historian Alfred McCoy  wrote recently in The Nation   that “ instead of reducing  the traffic, the drug war has actually helped stimulate that ninefold increase in global opium production and a parallel surge in U.S. heroin users, from just 68,000 in 1970 to 886,000 in 2017.”  Drug deaths  reached  192 a day  in 2017, with many of them between the ages of 12 and 25.  That  is a silent Parkland … every day. What is your solution to this catastrophe? Bill Williams New York To the Editor: One  egregious omission to date from the Democratic debates is the future of  Social Security,  which according to recent projections will face a  critical funding shortfall  by 2034. This threatens the well-being of millions of Americans. Efforts to discredit and undermine the program, whether through benefit cuts or privatization, will ultimately erode the nation’s entire social welfare system. Individuals earning under $50,000 a year receive 90 percent of Social Security benefits. Nearly half of all racial minority retirees rely on them for all or nearly all of their  income .  It’s time Democrats debated this vital issue. Michael Reisch Baltimore The writer is a professor of social justice at the University of Maryland School of Social Work. To the Editor: No  one is talking about or seems to care about the  deficit and national debt . We are running a  $1 trillion deficit  during good times, so what happens when things go south, which they inevitably will? I don’t want to saddle my children with a huge national debt. Matt Carbone Valhalla, N.Y. The writer is an accountant.  To the Editor: There has yet to be any meaningful debate discussion of  the judiciary . The president has appointed over  150 judges  (and counting), including two Supreme Court justices, one of whom remains controversial a year after his appointment. I would like to hear questions about what the candidates would be looking for in their judicial appointments and also what they plan to do when their plans are inevitably derailed by judges appointed by this president. It may also be time to open a discussion of changes to the judiciary, such as term limits for judges. Should someone who is president for only four (or even eight) years really be able to reshape the judiciary for 40 years?  The Republicans are highly successful at getting their voters to the polls with promises of judicial appointments. It is beyond time for the Democrats to stress the importance of judicial appointments to their voters. If the president is re-elected, he will undoubtedly get at least one more Supreme Court appointment, and the consequences for the country would be dire. Judy Gitlin Valley Cottage, N.Y. To the Editor: I  offer the candidates not an issue to discuss but a plea to include in their discussion what has been absent:  the hope and promise of America . The candidates, rightly enough but relentlessly and angrily, point to what we do wrong, to our endless faults, our systemic racism, sexual harassment, cruel capitalism, economic injustices and widespread discrimination. Recall Ronald Reagan’s  “Morning in America”  ad. However shallow it may have sounded, and however much mocked, it resonated deeply, and we recall it even today.  Perhaps candidates should take a hint. Perhaps point to a vision, however imperfectly realized so far, of a country where liberty and justice are part of its promise and its future, a country for which so many sacrificed. Perhaps draw inspiration if not from Reagan then from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose message always remained one of hope, of a dream.  Mel A. Topf Providence, R.I.  To the Editor: The  issue of  affordable housing  for low- and moderate-income persons has not been adequately addressed. Although Senator Bernie Sanders and Julián Castro, former Housing and Urban Development secretary, have made fleeting references, I have not heard a thorough discussion of this problem, including homelessness. I believe that decisive federal action is necessary because local and state government simply lack the resources to solve this nationwide problem. Bob Ryan San Francisco To the Editor: It  is becoming increasingly apparent that Congress has ceded too much power to the unrestrained discretion of the president on matters such as tariffs, spending (on, for example, the wall) and war by invoking an “emergency.” There must be discussion about what the candidates would support to properly  rebalance power  between the executive and legislative branches. Joel Lutzker Greenwich, Conn. To the Editor: I  have an opposite suggestion: Ban all questions about health care. We need to hear about other pressing issues. David Martocci Interlaken, N.J. To the Editor: The  Democratic debates have virtually ignored numerous  national security  issues, particularly the bloated defense budget; the overzealous tempo of military deployments; the overabundant overseas bases; the unnecessary modernization of our nuclear weapons; and the troublesome decline of arms control and disarmament. The United States has become the dominant arms merchant in the international arena and has downplayed the important instrument of diplomacy. A manifesto signed by  Bertrand Russell, Albert Einstein and others  warned years ago: “ We have to learn  to ask ourselves, not what steps can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a military contest that will be disastrous to all parties?”  The Democratic debates would be a good place to start this conversation.  Melvin A. Goodman Bethesda, Md. The writer is a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy and former C.I.A. intelligence analyst. To the Editor: Millions  of workers are earning less than their parents did. This is true of those affected by automation and international trade and those with less than a high school education. They have not only lost income but also feel left out. What will the candidates do to increase the supply of well-paying, respected  jobs ? Peter Dawson Boulder, Colo. To the Editor: Debate  topics? How perfect that the mandate is “ no more than 200 words .” I’d like to see a discussion of the very  travesty of “debates” : prime-time manufactured, largely substanceless verbal contests with strict time limits. No nuance, no depth, no real follow-up.  It’s all sportscasting, replete with countdown clocks and sleazy previews and promotions, offering the promise of zingers, punches landed, gaffes, put-downs, rehearsed scripts, weaponized sound bites. Afterward are headlines about who won, who lost, who’s out, who came back.  How much better would be in-depth, challenging interviews, with follow-ups, rather than this sorry, unbearable sideshow.  Susan Wolfson Princeton, N.J. To the Editor: Agriculture  is being recognized as both the culprit and the savior in our race to combat climate change. I’d like to know what the candidates plan to do about the crisis affecting land stewardship and food production. In the Midwest, where I live, small farmers struggle to make a living, are ignored by federal and state governments, and often end up abandoning their important profession. It’s time to recognize that the fate of these farms is the canary in the coal mine. Vikki Proctor Evanston, Ill. To the Editor: One  glaring omission is  reproductive rights . While most candidates have at least alluded to protecting those rights, there has been no specific question about what each would do to keep the Supreme Court from reversing Roe v. Wade, even though a case challenging it is likely to come before the court in the next few years. Even more important, what would the candidates do to protect access to contraception, now covered in the Affordable Care Act? As The Times  just reported , the abortion rate is at its lowest since 1973, when it became legal, partly because of coverage of long-term contraception methods by Obamacare. Now the Trump administration is trying to roll back contraceptive coverage. How will the next Democratic president ensure that women have control over their reproductive lives? Ellen Sweet New York The writer is former vice president of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health. To the Editor: I  wish the candidates would address the  dysfunction in the Senate . Particularly, why does the Senate majority leader have such outsized power to shape national policy by controlling what the Senate will even consider? It is not a matter of constitutional law. It is just Senate rules — essentially a tradition, tacitly agreed upon among senators. The Senate does not reflect principles of democracy, and it needs reform. I would like to hear the leading candidates, several of whom are senators, discuss ways to reform the Senate and place some limits on the power of the majority leader.  Michael T. Ferro Endwell, N.Y. To the Editor: I  would ask: What rules or restraints would you impose upon yourself and others in your administration on  tweeting ?  Dick Stoll Milwaukee"
"Marking  Fox Nation' s 200th episode of “ Deep Dive,”  a panel of experts joined Fox News Political contributor  Tammy Bruce  to break down the latest developments after the White House released a transcript of the Presidential phone call that apparently convinced Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Cali., to move forward with a formal  impeachment  inquiry. READ THE UKRAINE CALL MEMO Scrutiny of Trump's conversation with the President of Ukraine was sparked by an unidentified whistleblower, who reportedly accused the President of making a ""promise"" to a foreign leader.  Subsequent reporting raised new questions after it was revealed the White House had withheld millions of dollars of aid for Ukraine and allegedly pressured the Ukranian President to launch an investigation of Joe Biden's son. ""The phone call is kind of a world away from what we were told it was going to be,"" said Bruce. ""We were told it was a quid-pro-quo...but, in reality, it seems very different than that...We're all kind of smiling here with some of these developments."" ""We're all kind of smiling here with these developments"" Wall Street Journal editorial board member  Bill McGurn  agreed with Bruce, calling the phone call a ""nothing burger,"" and he slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for falsely declaring the opening of an ""official impeachment investigation,"" which technically requires a House vote. Assistant editor of the Wall Street Journal editorial page and Fox News contributor James Freeman believes the Democrats may have fallen into a trap. WH TO RELEASE DOCUMENT SHOWING INTEL COMMUNITY IG FOUND WHISTLEBLOWER HAD 'POLITICAL BIAS', SOURCE SAYS ""You read the transcript...you almost wonder if this whistleblower--instead of being an anti-Trump guy, secretly has a red hat at home,"" he joked, referring to the famous red MAGA caps associated with the support of President Trump. ""Was it Ivanka with a mustache calling them up?"" Bruce chimed in, suggesting that speculation about the call may have worked in Trump's favor. Mary Anastasia O'Grady, who is also a Wall Street Journal editorial board member, stressed that Pelosi did not open an official investigation as she said, but ""expanded the number of committees that are going to investigate."" UKRAINE CALL MEMO SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, BUT DID NOT MENTION AID ""So you're going to have a lot of hearings, people might get the sense that there's an inquiry going on...and yet there hasn't been a vote for that,"" she explained. ""I think they're going to drag that on for a long time, and you know, tarnish the president, even if in the end they don't actually take it to the floor."" McGurn said the Democrats' impeachment tactics represent something deeper, and that if they truly believed America supported the President's impeachment, they would bring it to a House vote. MEDIA MOVED THE GOALPOSTS AFTER RELEASE OF TRUMP UKRAINE PHONE CALL ""This is a reflection of the Democrats' lack of confidence in their candidates in 2020. They think Biden might be too old and weak to beat Trump, and they worry Warren might be too left-wing,"" he said. ""Otherwise why would you -- so close to an election -- not... take your case to the American people that Donald Trump is unfit and vote him out.  It's a reflection that they don't have confidence that they can persuade the American people of the rightness of their cause."" Trump responded to calls for impeachment Wednesday with an early-morning tweet decrying the probe. “There has been no President in the history of our country who has been treated so badly as I have. The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear. They get nothing done. This should never be allowed to happen to another President. Witch Hunt,"" he tweeted.

"To the Editor: Re  “ Claim on Trump Is Said to Involve a Foreign Leader ” (front page, Sept. 20): Donald Trump has said, “ I have the right  to do whatever I want as president.” Indeed this is mostly true. The president not only has broad powers but he can even be spared legal consequences as long as he remains in office. This was made painfully clear in the Mueller investigation. There are, however, red lines. The founding fathers did allow for congressional oversight and action in the event of a bad actor who would use the office of the presidency in service of himself rather than in service of the country. Now there is a whistle-blower in the intelligence community who has urgent information about the president that he believes Congress needs to know. It is information that Mr. Trump and the Justice Department would rather see withheld from Congress. If speculations are true, and the president himself or through an emissary threatened to withhold vital military aid to Ukraine if it did not investigate business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden’s son or pursue a corruption investigation of Mr. Biden himself, that type of quid pro quo would be deeply troubling. It is the definition of politically self-serving. Lawlessness is rampant in the Trump administration. If we want to restore the rule of law to our republic and faith in our democracy, we must insist that the whistle-blower be permitted to speak, come what may.  Felicia Massarsky Atlantic City To the Editor: The  legacy of President Trump will be a field of horrors stretching to the horizon, but interrupted by a few bits of important insight into the flaws in our democracy. Who would have thought a president would refuse to disclose his potentially conflicting business interests, then use his powers to enhance those very interests? Who would have thought that the nation’s chief executive would dispatch a lackey to threaten his duly appointed attorney general with professional execution if he didn’t reverse a principled decision? Who would have thought that in service of his re-election, the leader of the nation might have tried to enlist a foreign power to conduct an investigation of his likely political opponent? Yes, one day we’ll look back on these times with disgust, but it will be seasoned with a pinch of sardonic gratitude to the man who showed us where we might find the cracks in what we thought was the seamless wall of our democracy. Mark Steinberg Los Angeles The writer was an assistant deputy attorney general and a counselor on international law under President Bill Clinton. "
"That defense goes like this: Donald Trump never said to Zelensky, ""I won't do X unless you give me Y."" He never said the phrase ""quid pro quo."" Therefore, nothing to see here! ""Wow.   Impeachment  over this?,""  tweeted  South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham after reading the Ukraine call transcript. ""What a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger."" Asked by the Boston Globe's  Jess Bidgood  what he would consider a quid pro quo from Trump to Zelensky,  Graham replied : ""'Uh, hey pal, you know, you need to like, go after the Bidens or I ain't gonna give you any money,' [He'd] be really, like, thuggish about it."" Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's lawyers, made a very similar argument in an  interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on Wednesday night . ""I think it's important to understand what we don't have, and what we don't have is a quid pro quo,'"" said Sekulow. ""In other words, 'I will do this, you do this.' That is absent."" So, that's the bar? Really?  Take the logic of Graham and Sekulow out of this context and put it in an entirely different one. If someone comes up to you on the street, points a gun at you and says, ""Give me all your money!"" then, under Graham's conceit, you aren't being robbed. In order for it to be an actual robbery, the man pointing the gun has to say: ""Give me all your money. This is a robbery."" Makes zero sense, right?  You know what's happening even if the guy doesn't declare that he is using the threat of possible violence to separate you from your money. Why? Because, well, you just know. The human brain is able to look at a series of related inputs -- gun, demand for money, agitation -- and connect the dots: I am being robbed. Now, circle back to Trump's conversation with Zelensky.  To revisit that conversation : 1. Trump, after congratulating Zelensky on his win, very quickly establishes that the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.  ""I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are."" 2. He then makes clear that the US does a lot more for Ukraine than Ukraine does for the US. ""I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine."" 3. Trump directly asks Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me."" 4. He suggests that Zelensky should talk to his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr. ""I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it."" 5. And then Trump reiterates that suggestion. ""I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call."" Soooooooooo, yeah. Graham and Sekulow are technically correct that Trump didn't directly tell Zelensky that if he wanted what the US had to offer ( like hundreds of millions of military aid ) that he had better look into the Bidens. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, by the way). But come on, man! Put yourself in Zelensky's shoes for a minute and ask whether it is  at all possible  that the message you would have received from that call was something along the lines of "" We do a lot for you. If you want us to keep doing it, you need to do this one thing for me."" Plus, there's this: Impeachment -- which the House embarked on formally this week with the beginnings of an inquiry -- is a political process, not a legal one. Meaning that even if you buy Graham's no-quid-pro-quo argument, which you shouldn't, there is no requirement for proof that Trump said the words in order to impeach him. Know who got this all exactly right? Lindsey Graham. In 1999 --  when he said this : ""A president doesn't even have to be convicted of a crime to be impeached. Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office."""
"Which brings us to this moment in history, and to President Donald Trump, who is now facing  a formal impeachment inquiry  after spending the first half of his presidency successfully trying to avoid one.  How to explain the President's behavior? How is it possible that after the country was torn apart by the Russian interference in the 2016 election and its aftermath, and after Trump himself endured almost two years under the searing spotlight of an investigation into that very thing, how is it possible that he could reach out to another country and --  according to a whistleblower complaint  -- attempt another round of election interference? How is that possible? Yes, the President and his supporters deny that's what he was doing.  I suggest we all read  the White House memo reconstructing the July 25 phone call  with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the now-declassified  whistleblower complaint  and see what we think it indicates.  Zelensky, sitting on Wednesday next to Trump, the world's most powerful man, pleaded "" I'm sorry, but I don't want to be involved""  in the US election, adding ""I think and you read (in the transcript) that nobody pushed me."" If Trump did demand that Zelensky launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a top challenger in the 2020 elections -- as appears evident from the White House transcript -- it would constitute a display of hubris worthy of Euripides.  Trump himself perfectly encapsulated the depths of his hubristic delusion when  he famously declared  ""I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters."" He just may be engaged in a metaphorical test of that theory.   Trump may survive the impeachment process because Republicans in the Senate have shown little inclination to defy him. But if he does fall, it will be in large part because he has believed the oleaginous praise he demanded. He bought his own over-the-top marketing campaign about himself.  Who can forget those nearly unwatchable televised early Cabinet meetings, where normally-dignified figures went around the table singing his praises, describing the  ""incredible honor,""  the  ""blessing that you've given us to serve your agenda""  and be allowed to work with such a leader. And how could Trump fail to be dazzled by the  steady diet of obsequious Fox anchors, who day after day claim he may just be the best president in the history of the United States, bringing  ""sunshine beaming""  through the White House, as Fox Business's Lou Dobbs put it. Of course, Trump has not needed much outside help to think highly of himself. He  declares himself a ""very stable genius.""  His Twitter feed is a torrent of adulation for the President, some of it quoting others, some provided  by Trump himself (punctuated by reports of his  unprecedented victimhood .) Self-esteem, we're told, is a good thing. But we are also reminded to measure ""everything in moderation."" Trump has apparently come to believe that he is so brilliant, so talented, so invincible, that he could get away with defying every norm, every practice, every institution of the democracy he is charged with leading.  And, why wouldn't he? After all, he won the 2016 election -- though, we'll note, not the popular vote -- despite what all the experts said. And he did it after openly, publicly, asking Russia for help. When the depths of Russian efforts to help Trump became known and fully,  incontrovertibly documented,  Trump still managed to survive. He survived the Mueller investigation, and continued to refer triumphantly to the scandalous episode of Russian interference to help him win as a scenario cooked up by his political adversaries, calling it to this day ""The Russia Hoax."" Not only did he pull that off, he managed to convince a significant portion of the country that his lies are the truth and that the truth-tellers are the ""enemies of the people."" All of this has fueled his hubris. And energized by it, he picked up the phone on July 25, the day after Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified in Congress, and called President Zelensky -- a political novice who had  played a president  on TV.  When Zelensky told him Ukraine needs to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles to defend against a Russian-backed war, Trump replied,  ""I would like you to do us a favor.""   It sounds exactly like a suggestion of tit for tat or, in impeachment parlance, a quid pro quo. By then, Trump had already held up the transfer of $400 million in urgently needed aid to Ukraine, a move that was exasperating and mystifying to members of Congress, which had approved the aid. But the reason for the holdup is becoming increasingly clear. We might never have learned about all this were it not for the player who stepped on the scene in the manner of the hero in a Greek tragedy, the whistleblower. It is disheartening to know how many people in the administration have been aware of the alleged misdeeds of this presidency, and opted to keep quiet. But such are the flaws of humans. Whether or not they anger the gods, they remain a source of disappointment to those who try to do right. Fortunately, an occasional brave man or woman rises to the challenge and, at great personal risk, takes actions to save the rest of us. That is the definition of heroism, and that is exactly what the whistleblower did. The  whistleblower has given us in excruciating details  an account of what happened in the White House, including the fact that the transcript of the July 25 call was not handled like a normal communication.  Instead, it was allegedly placed in a high-security computer system managed by the National Security Council, reserved for the most secret material, ""such as covert action."" That looks very much like a cover-up. And, according to the whistleblower complaint, it was ""not the first time,"" it had happened. The interactions with Ukraine by the President and some members of his team, notably his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, often seem more The Sopranos than the classics. And in the end, Trump may end up not only escaping removal by impeachment but also winning reelection in 2020. It's a reminder that despite the crushing repercussions of hubris and the inspiring actions of a hero, this is, above all, a tragedy for the entire country."
"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 24 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com The legal team for the whistleblower who alleged that  President Trump  pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Trump’s potential 2020 rival,  Joe Biden , and his son wrote a statement Tuesday urging acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to release the complaint to the Intelligence Oversight Committees. PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP   ""We support the bipartisan, unanimous resolution passed by the Senate regarding our client's lawful whistleblower complaint and call upon the acting director of national intelligence to transmit our complete disclosure to the two Intelligence Oversight Committees,"" the statement read. The Republican-controlled Senate on Tuesday voted by unanimous consent for a resolution calling on the Trump administration to release to the Senate Intelligence Committee the whistleblower’s complaint. The Intelligence Committee has opened a bipartisan investigation into the complaint, and it was reported that the whistleblower may appear before the committee to give closed-door testimony. AOC ON TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: 'WHAT HE HAS ADMITTED TO IS ALREADY IMPEACHABLE, REGARDLESS OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS' The whisteblower’s legal counsel, Compass Rose Legal Group, confirmed in the statement that it wrote to the acting DNI for security guidance to permit the meeting if needed. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D.-Calif., responded to Compass Rose on Tuesday, requesting an interview with the whistleblower. ""In light of your notice of intent to the acting director of national intelligence, the committee requests a voluntary interview with your client on Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019, in the afternoon, following the public testimony of acting Director Maguire before the committee. The committee is prepared to work with you to identify a secure location and format that preserves your client's privacy and ensure protection from reprisal or threat of reprisal,"" said Schiff. Schiff also said the committee expects the acting DNI, in light of the legal counsel's letter to him, to cease withholding the complaint and provide the whistleblower with guidance as to how to communicate with his committee directly. Maguire, as of Monday, was refusing to share details of the complaint with lawmakers. As a prelude to ratcheting up an impeachment inquiry, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  said Sunday  that unless Maguire provided information about the whistleblower complaint to Congress, administration officials would ""be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.” In a letter last week, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Jason Klitenic, wrote the agency is protecting the whistleblower and said the allegation is not an “urgent concern” and did not relate to ‘intelligence activity’ under the DNI’s supervision. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The whistleblower has alleged that President Trump ordered his staff to freeze $400 million in aid to Ukraine days before a July phone call with President Zelensky. Trump told Zelensky he would not release the aid money until Zelenksy investigated Biden and his son Hunter’s ties to a Ukrainian firm some allege was looking to influence the Obama administration through the Bidens. An  inside source  told Fox News the whistleblower didn't have any ""firsthand knowledge"" of the call. Vandana Rambaran contributed to this report."
"The breathless text message from President Trump and his campaign landed soon after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry: “I need you on my Impeachment Defense Team.” Within three hours of Ms. Pelosi’s announcement on Tuesday, Mr. Trump had raised $1 million, and his campaign manager said on Wednesday that Mr. Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee had raised $5 million in 24 hours. “Huge groundswell of support,” wrote Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager,  on Twitter . The impeachment fight between the Democratic-led House of Representatives and the Trump White House may have initiated a constitutional clash, but for the political operatives involved in  the 2020 campaign  it also represents  a potentially galvanizing moment to pry loose wallets . In a flurry of tweets, text messages and emails, Mr. Trump has pressed his millions of supporters to donate to protect his hold on the presidency.  At times, the Trump campaign almost seemed to mock the allegations that he improperly  sought assistance from a foreign nation against a political rival , former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in a  call with the president of Ukraine . One email from Mr. Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee arrived with the paper clip symbol and the words “Call Transcript” in the subject line, suggesting there was an attachment. There was no attachment. Instead, Mr. Trump was seeking “charter members” for his “Official Impeachment Defense Task Force” against a Democratic “smear job.” At least initially, most Democrats were less explicit than Mr. Trump in seeking to monetize the impeachment push, with several emailing their lists of supporters to first ask them to sign impeachment petitions, rather than asking directly for donations. But money still flowed: The online ticker for ActBlue, the company that processes most online Democratic donations, showed that Tuesday was one of the bigger fund-raising days in recent months that was not linked to a Democratic debate or a monthly deadline. The site showed $4.6 million in donations on Tuesday, after $4.2 million on Monday. All  the 2020 Democratic presidential campaigns  use ActBlue , as do most Democratic House and Senate candidates. The Democratic National Committee said  a text message  it sent out on Tuesday evening raised more money than any of its previous texting efforts. “URGENT: Stand with Speaker Pelosi as the House moves forward with an official impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump,” the message read. The D.N.C. also said that Tuesday was its best fund-raising day of the month. (Notably, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm for House Democrats, has so far not included impeachment in its fund-raising solicitations.) Mr. Biden  finds himself in a particularly unusual situation. Following the revelation that Mr. Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate unsubstantiated corruption allegations about Mr. Biden and his son, Mr. Biden’s campaign has pushed supporters to stand with him — financially. “Disgusting,” read one email subject line. “About Ukraine,” said another. “Donald Trump asked a foreign leader eight times to investigate my family,” one appeal read. “But I’m only going to ask you once: Please, I need you with me at this critical moment. Chip in to my campaign tonight.” A Biden adviser said the campaign had tripled its daily online fund-raising average on Saturday, though the adviser didn’t respond Wednesday morning when asked whether that pace had continued. The campaign also sent a fund-raising email Tuesday evening suggesting that Mr. Biden’s sliding poll numbers were a bigger problem than Mr. Trump’s foreign dealings. “Look, here’s the bad news: Trump is using the Oval Office to pressure a foreign power into interfering in the 2020 election,” the email said. “And it gets even worse: A new poll has us down in Iowa, a key first state in this Primary race.” The release on Wednesday of a reconstructed transcript  of the call between Mr. Trump and  President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine  could add further fund-raising fodder.  “BREAKING: Trump memo bombshell,” read an email from the campaign of Senator  Kamala Harris  of California . Inside, the campaign urged supporters to “rush a contribution to Kamala’s presidential campaign to elect a president who will fight for truth, justice and the rule of law — and defeat the lawless one we have now.” Ms. Harris was also running an ad on Facebook targeting Iowa voters, in which she called for impeachment proceedings in a video. The campaign of Senator  Elizabeth Warren  of Massachusetts,  who saw a fund-raising bump when she called for impeachment in April , is using the issue to try to expand its email list, running Facebook ads on the subject. “The impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands,” Ms. Warren says in an ad that began running on Tuesday. “The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment — and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires. Sign up now if you’re with me.”  Ms. Warren’s campaign has been spending modestly on impeachment-related Facebook ads for months, according to Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic digital communications firm. From late April to mid-September, her campaign spent an estimated $133,000 on Facebook ads about impeachment, according to the firm. But that represented only about 8 percent of her overall spending on Facebook during that period. Katie Glueck, Thomas Kaplan and Rachel Shorey contributed reporting."
"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 22 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com U.S. Rep.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  has apparently reached a boiling point over moderate  House Democrats ’ caution regarding the prospect of impeaching  President Trump . The go-slow approach is personified by House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi , with whom Ocasio-Cortez has had an often contentious relationship since the freshman lawmaker arrived in Washington just eight months ago. The New York Democrat told her more than 5 million Twitter followers late Saturday that the Democrats’ “refusal” to seek the removal of the president was a “bigger national scandal” than what she alleged was the president’s “lawbreaking behavior.” JUSTIN HASKINS: ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ PROVES AGAIN SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT Calls for impeachment have grown louder from some Democrats in the wake of last week’s news that a purported “ whistleblower ” had expressed concern about a phone call said to have taken place between President Trump and the leader of  Ukraine , in which Trump allegedly sought information about 2020 Democratic frontrunner  Joe Biden , whose son Hunter Biden  had business dealings  in Ukraine.  Soon after Ocasio-Cortez posted her Saturday comment, she received a response from James Fallows, the noted author, journalist and former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, who asserted that Ocasio-Cortez was overstating the case in criticizing members of her own party for exercising restraint regarding impeachment. LEADING HOUSE DEM TELLS PARTY NOT TO BE 'HASTY' IN PURSUING WHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGATIONS “IMO, this is ‘false equivalence’ of its own sort,” Fallows wrote. “What Trump is doing remains objectively the biggest threat, scandal, and problem. “Second-ranking: the silent acquiescence of the GOP Senate. “Then: it’s time for the House to act.” Ocasio Cortez doubled down in her response to Fallows. “It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law,” she wrote. “It’s another to let him. “The integrity of our democracy isn’t threatened when a president breaks the law. It’s threatened when we do nothing about it. “The GOP’s silence & refusal to act shouldn’t be a surprise. Ours is.” Ocasio-Cortez’s online outburst followed remarks earlier in the day by fellow progressive and 2020 presidential candidate Sen.  Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., who took a veiled shot at Pelosi, the standard-bearer among Democrats of a “wait and see” approach regarding potential action against the president. ""Donald Trump did everything he could to obstruct justice,” Warren said at an event in Iowa. “I read all 448 pages [of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Russia investigation] and when I got to the end, I called for the impeachment of Donald Trump. “ Congress failed to act ,” Warren added, “and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system.” Just over a week ago, Pelosi had  lashed out at reporters  when they repeatedly asked her about impeachment at a news conference. “Impeachment is a very divisive measure,” a clearly frustrated Pelosi said, “but if we have to go there, we have to go there and we can't go there unless we have the facts. And we’ll follow the facts and follow the obstruction the president is making ... and make a decision when we’re ready. “That’s the only question, that’s all I’m going to say about this subject, and there's nothing different from one day to the next,” she added. The struggles experienced by the 79-year-old Pelosi, a three-decade member of Congress from California, have included frequent clashes with Ocasio-Cortez, 29, and other progressive – and aggressive – young lawmakers who were swept into office during last year’s midterm elections. The progressives’ push for far-left policies, including Ocasio-Cortez’s  Green New Deal , as well as their vocal opposition to President Trump, have been at odds with the moderates’ typically lower-key approach to getting things done. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a  closed-door meeting in July , in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. The meeting was soon followed by the  departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff , Saikat Chakrabarti. But with Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter posts that began late Saturday, it appears the truce with Pelosi – at least regarding impeachment – may be over.

"The poll shows Warren at 27% and Biden at 25% among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, and is the first major national poll to show Warren in this strong a position since polling in Iowa and New Hampshire also found the two knotted at the top of the field. Although the difference between the candidates' numbers is within the poll's margin of error, the Massachusetts Democrat's new ranking is the first time a candidate other than the former vice president has topped the pack since Quinnipiac started posing the question in March. The two candidates also saw change in support from the poll's  August results,  when Biden was at 32% and Warren was at 19%.  The poll reflects a tightening Democratic race as well as Warren's increasing consolidation of the progressive vote and making inroads among black voters. Her support among that crucial demographic bloc has climbed dramatically in recent months, from 4% in July to 8% in August to 19% now. Biden's support among black voters, meanwhile, has dipped from 53% to 40% over the same time. The numbers signal a potential softening in a key base for Biden's campaign, as well as an ability for Warren to grow support beyond white college-educated liberals. In the new poll, Warren and Biden are followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (16%), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (7%) and California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%). All other candidates got 2% or lower in the poll.  Two other national telephone polls released since the last round of debates -- from  NBC News and the Wall Street Journal , and from  Fox News  -- found Biden in a stronger position ahead of Warren. But recent surveys taken in early voting states show a two-person top tier forming. A  CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll  released over the weekend found Warren surging in Iowa against Biden, standing at 22% to the former vice president's 20% among likely Iowa caucusgoers. And in New Hampshire, a poll of likely Democratic primary voters from Monmouth University favor Warren over Biden, 27% to 25%. The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted by telephone September 19 through 23 among a random sample of 1,337 registered voters with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. The survey includes 561 Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points."
"It took a remarkable number of unlikely occurrences to make Donald Trump president. In Hillary Clinton he had a distinctly unpopular opponent who, like him, divided the electorate along starkly partisan lines. She was undermined by a foreign government that stole and released damaging information on her campaign, as well as a federal investigation that tied her to scandal with regular updates and revelations. Clinton also faced — and Trump had the advantage of — news media that couldn’t distinguish between ordinary, if unseemly, political misconduct and truly extraordinary transgressions. All of this — including third-party candidates who split the anti-Trump vote, a Clinton campaign that didn’t compete for vital constituencies, and the president’s own campaign of innuendo and racist demagogy — was just enough to win him a slim victory in the Electoral College. And while Trump still brags about his “historic victory,” he is clearly aware of the unique conditions that drove his unlikely win. It’s why he has devoted the past year to trying to recreate them. The emerging Ukraine scandal is a case in point. Thanks to a whistle-blower in the intelligence community as well as reporting from  investigative journalists  at multiple newspapers (including this one), we have enough evidence to think that Trump used hundreds of millions in congressionally authorized military aid to try to extort the Ukrainian government into investigating Hunter Biden’s business activities in the country, as well as Joe Biden’s  alleged efforts to protect his son from prosecution. [Join Jamelle Bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing, culture and ideas from around the internet. For exclusive thoughts, photos and reading recommendations, sign up for his newsletter.] The president doesn’t deny this. “The conversation I had was largely congratulatory,” Trump said on Sunday. “It was largely corruption — all the corruption taking place, it was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son,” contributing to “the corruption already in the Ukraine.” The president  confessed  this again on Monday, while speaking at the United Nations. “We’re supporting a country. We want to make sure that country is honest,” Trump said. “If you don’t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?” There’s no mystery here. Trump doesn’t care about corruption — he runs a network of clubs and hotels where interested parties can spend huge sums and curry favor with the administration — but he is worried about Biden’s popularity with Democrats and the wider public. The former vice president leads in nearly every head-to-head matchup with Trump. If the election were held today and Biden were the nominee, Trump would likely lose by double digits. But if Trump can make 2020 another race between two unpopular nominees — if he can sully his opponent and make  him  another creature of “the swamp” — then he has a shot at victory. Imagine a world where the Ukrainian government enters the election on behalf of Trump. The president can now do to Biden what he did to Hillary Clinton in 2016 — mire him in enough scandal and innuendo to undermine the vice president’s claim to honesty. “Crooked Hillary” seamlessly becomes “Crooked Joe.” And Biden is vulnerable. He has spent his entire adult life working in Washington, and there’s  little question  that his son is involved in the kinds of buck-raking and influence peddling that alienates voters and makes them cynical about politics. As for the other parts of Trump’s unusual 2016 victory, there isn’t — as far as we know — an F.B.I. investigation of Biden or any other Democratic candidate. But Attorney General William Barr has already shown his willingness to use the law in Trump’s favor, and Trump brought him up in his call with Zelensky. It was Barr, of course, whose  misleading  summary of the Mueller report initially defused criticism and stymied efforts to hold the president accountable for his attempts to obstruct justice. Given this commitment to the president’s political interests, it’s not hard to  imagine how Barr might use “revelations”  from the Ukrainian government to pursue an inquiry into the former vice president and his son, releasing information at a pace that feeds the story, strengthens the appearance of impropriety and ultimately undermines Biden’s campaign. Trump, at least, thinks the attorney general is up to the task.  In Trump’s conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Trump referred him to Barr . “There is a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that,” the president said to Zelensky,  according to a recently released   reconstructed transcript . “So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.” The attorney general of the United States, that is.  I’ve focused on Biden because he’s the current target of the president’s effort. But if Trump is aware of the contingency of his victory — if he knows that  everything  had to fall into place in just the right way for him to win — then we should expect him to do the same to whoever wins the Democratic nomination. The thing to remember is this: Trump has no reference point for electoral politics outside of the 2016 presidential election. He may sit at the top of American political life, but he’s still a novice. He’s not nimble enough to shift gears or change course. He has just one plan for victory, and he’s going to do everything he can to bring it to fruition. Here, as he has in every endeavor of his life, Donald Trump is going to try to cheat his way to success. And Democrats need to be ready to fight back with everything they have. That’s why impeachment is so important — not just to hold Trump accountable but also to keep him from using the presidency to stack the deck in his favor.

"Zelensky, a former comedian, secured a  landslide election victory in April . With no previous experience as a politician, he has to confront Russia's occupation of Crimea, as well as the ongoing conflict in the eastern region of Donbas with Russia-backed separatists. This may be a unique moment in the modern history of Ukraine. Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Trump, who are driven by their own respective political agendas, have suddenly inserted themselves in the midst of what could become an international imbroglio with Ukraine. But Putin, Trump and Zelensky have converging interests, and all three could potentially come out as winners in a scenario that leads to the withdrawal of Russian troops from eastern Ukraine, lifted sanctions on Russia, and the reelection of Trump. Ukraine has played a  key role in Russia's success  long before President Vladimir Putin rose to power. Ukraine's  fertile black-earth farmland  has long been a key Russian breadbasket, while the Donbas region is a major locus of heavy industry and  mineral reserves . Its Black Sea ports, particularly in Crimea, are  crucial to the Russian navy .  Even after the fall of the Soviet Union and Ukraine's independence, its rulers were often inclined to maintain  amicable relations  with Russia. In 2014, when the Maidan revolution toppled the pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Russian forces blithely moved in and annexed Crimea, then sent anonymous paramilitary forces known as ""little green men"" i nto the heart of Donbas . The European Union, along with the US, levied a series of tough  economic sanctions   that continue to weigh heavily  on the Russian economy. More than five years after the annexation, Putin remains desperate for these sanctions to be lifted. Now, Ukraine appears to have become at least as critically important to Donald Trump, for a whole different set of reasons. It is here, Trump seems to believe, that he can pin charges of  corruption on the son of Vice President Joe Biden , a Democratic candidate he clearly fears. And suddenly, both he and Putin appear now to have a Ukrainian president in power who is at the very least open for dialogue. At first,  Zelensky  supported Ukraine's eventual membership in the  European Union and NATO —both moves utterly anathema to Putin. Then the new Ukrainian leader proposed  ending the war  with Russian-backed forces in the Donbas by negotiating with Putin, and struck a hostage exchange with the Russian president that was lauded by President Trump as a ""first giant step to peace."" But he has also been especially interested in  ending the rampant corruption  that marked the  rule of his predecessor ,  Petro Poroshenko . Which is what seemed to give an opening to Donald Trump. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is  interested in what he describes as  Biden's efforts to oust Ukraine's top prosecutor because of an investigation into the natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where the former vice president's son Hunter Biden, had a role on the board  The allegation against the Bidens has been debunked by respected fact-checking teams at news organizations including CNN. At least one former official in the prosecutor's office  said the investigation into Burisma had already been shelved  by the time Joe Biden was pressuring Ukraine to replace its top prosecutor, who was unpopular among many Western leaders due to concerns regarding corruption. It's also unclear if Hunter Biden was a focus of that investigation when it was occurring.  Despite this, it appears Trump and Giuliani believe Zelensky should look into the matter. In May, Giuliani  abruptly canceled his trip to Ukraine  a day after he announced his intentions to meet with Zelensky in Kiev. Instead, he traveled to Spain in August,  and met with Andriy Yermak , a lawyer who serves as the president's aide.  According to  Politico , the State Department said that the meeting had been facilitated by  Kurt Volker , who has served abroad under four American presidents and is currently  executive director  of the McCain Institute for International Leadership and US Special Representative for Ukraine. I have known Volker as an individual of the utmost probity, and he, like the most seasoned American diplomats, clearly understands the need for all sides to feel as though they are coming out as winners. Which may be where the interest of all three key players converge. Consider this scenario. Putin would no doubt very much like to see a second term for Trump. Already, the American president is pressing fellow members of the G7 to welcome Putin back into the club next year, and floating the  idea that he will host the summit at his Miami golf resort . If Trump wins the 2020 election, he'll be freed from any need to win the support of voters. Trump would also presumably be free to move toward lifting sanctions against Russia, no matter how strenuously Congress -- and the rest of the western alliance -- might protest.  Zelensky, for his part, could do a big favor for Putin by digging into whatever Giuliani might want to help his client's presidential re-election effort. Putin, in turn, might even reciprocate by easing up on military actions in Donbas (though it is unlikely ever to return Crimea to Ukraine). In the Oval Office on Friday, Trump suggested he was not acting in his own personal interest by  saying  ""I always look for the conversation that's going to help the United States the most."" In the same discussion, he also described the whistleblower, who filed an official complaint,  as having a ""partisan"" agenda . Clearly hedging his own bets, Zelensky has held at least two c onversations with the Russian leader , and is also keen to  forge ties with the US .  The US released a $250 million military aid package days after  three House committees announced  a wide-ranging probe that would, among other things, look into whether such packages were being held hostage for the president's own political benefit. It is not unreasonable to expect that any future transactions would be smoothed by congenial relations between Zelensky and Trump, or even Putin. The key question: will Ukraine's new president calculate that he can win big points with the Kremlin by giving a little help to Trump, Giuliani and their campaign from more than 5,000 miles away? And how might this play out the next time Zelensky faces re-election, after winning a landslide victory on an anti-corruption campaign? Some of this could be sorted out next week in New York since, as the  Kyiv Post reported,  Trump and Zelensky might actually meet during the United Nations General Assembly session. Putin will  not be on hand , as has been customary in recent years. Certainly, clearing the air sooner rather than later, however, would by far appear to be in the best interest of all three leaders. Zelensky, Putin and Trump will need to set forth just where their most profound priorities—and loyalties—lie."
"Impeachment proceedings went ahead against President Richard Nixon because he engaged in a cover-up of a break-in at the Democratic Party office at the Watergate, of which he  claimed  to have no advance knowledge. As is so often the case in Washington, it was the cover-up that rose to the level of a breach of public trust that was the grounds for impeachment proceedings against Nixon. In Trump's case, Democrats in the House can credibly make the case that while in office Trump pressured a foreign leader to dig up dirt on a political opponent, Joe Biden, and his family. President Trump insists he did nothing wrong.  And then Trump officials, realizing that there was something unseemly about the call between Trump and the Ukrainian President made every effort, according to the whistleblower, to ""lock down"" the transcript of the call by removing the transcript from where these transcripts are generally stored and loading it on a separate computer system where only the most classified and sensitive communications are stored, despite the fact that there was no classified information in the call. The United States has had an interest in supporting Ukraine's sovereignty -- in particular since Vladimir Putin seized Crimea, a part of Ukraine in 2014 -- and continues to support rebels in the eastern half of the country. That US support includes nearly $400 million of  military aid  that Trump put on hold just before his call with the Ukrainian President. What is striking is the tone of the whistleblower's complaint: This is a savvy Washington bureaucrat. This person is quite familiar with the law as it applies to whistleblowers and savvy enough to have presented his/her complaint at an unclassified level (with some classified material in an appendix) so that when it publicly surfaced, as it did Thursday morning, the public could make its own judgments about the nature of the whistleblower's complaints against President Trump and his enablers."
"In a rare strategy memo sent as part of a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday morning, Warren's campaign manager,  Roger Lau , announced an eight-figure TV and digital campaign in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.  The memo shared three examples of ads, all featuring the theme of rooting out corruption, that the campaign plans to launch, though it did not clarify which of the three would run online, on television or both, and exactly when the ads would begin to air. Lau noted that the campaign's biggest expense at the moment is staff but said he expects that to soon become media spending, with a bigger bulk of the expenditure going towards digital ads than TV.   ""At the start of this campaign, we laid out how Elizabeth is going to win the primary and the general election -- by identifying the deep problems the country faces, creating plans to solve them, and building a grassroots movement to win in 2020 and make big, structural change in 2021 and beyond,"" Lau wrote. ""As we head into the fall, here's how we'll build on our progress, build out our team, and keep growing the movement that will elect Elizabeth and elect Democrats up and down the ballot next November.""  ""I know what's wrong. I know how to fix it."" All three ads feature images of President  Donald Trump , Vice President  Mike Pence  and Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell .  ""I'm Elizabeth Warren. I know what's wrong. I know how to fix it. And I'll fight to get it done,"" Warren says in the closing of the 15-second and 30-second ads.    In the 30-second video, Warren touts her past accomplishments in Washington, including her role in the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and defeating former Republican Sen. Scott Brown in her first political campaign. It flashes a photo of Warren at the White House with former President Barack Obama.   ""I'll never let anyone tell me that anything is too hard,"" Warren says. ""Too hard to stand up to Wall Street? Too hard to protect consumers from cheating banks? Too hard to beat a popular Republican incumbent senator as a first-time candidate? Not too hard."" The full-minute ad begins with a biographical introduction of Warren's Oklahoma upbringing before transitioning to a familiar line from her stump speech: ""My second chance was a commuter college that cost $50 a semester."" ""Today there are fewer paths to America's middle class and even fewer second chances. Service members are targeted by predatory lenders; students are crushed by debt; families can't afford childcare,"" Warren says in that ad, which also features scenes from Warren's recent rally at Washington Square Park in New York City. ""And after generations of discrimination, people of color face an even narrower path to opportunity,"" she adds. ""When we have a government that works for the rich and the powerful, and leaves everyone else behind, it's corruption, pure and simple."" Investments beyond the early states Lau said in Thursday's memo that there would also be significant investment on the ground, including the hiring of new state directors and organizers in states that will hold primaries and caucuses well after the first several early states. ""We're targeting our resources to invest in places that will be critical to keeping the House, taking back the U.S. Senate, and regaining ground in key state legislatures in 2020,"" Lau wrote. ""That includes states like Illinois and California, where Democrats won a whole bunch of House seats in 2018 in close elections that we'll need to defend. It also includes states like Maine, which has a competitive Senate race and Georgia, where there will be two Senate seats up for election."" Lau made clear that the overarching aim is to put more resources into areas where Democrats are trying to either hold or flip congressional seats, as well as make inroads in state legislatures. Michigan, Minnesota, Florida and Texas are all on the list, he said. The goal: secure the House Democratic majority -- without which some of Warren's plans would be tough to enact in Washington -- and build Democratic power down the ballot to bolster support for her agenda. According to a Warren aide, all of the non-early states mentioned in the strategy memo -- Illinois, California, Maine, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Texas and Florida -- will have paid staff, including, eventually, state directors. ""If we want to make big, structural change,"" Lau writes, ""we need to make sure Democrats control the U.S. House and Senate and win important gubernatorial and state legislative races across the country."" Thursday's announcement comes less than a week out from the end of the third quarter fundraising deadline. Warren has vowed not to hold big-dollar fundraisers or solicit money from wealthy donors during the primaries, a decision that in part led to the departure of her finance director earlier in the year. But the campaign raised an impressive $19.1 million in the second quarter -- more than three times the $6 million she raised in the first quarter.   Warren has also benefited greatly from the transfer of more than $10 million from her Senate account. Unlike her current primary campaign, Warren's Senate reelection bid solicited money from big-dollar donors."

"But the Kentucky Republican and his fellow GOP senators did not explicitly commit to pushing for the full complaint turned over to the committee. McConnell's pledge came the same day Trump announced he would release an ""unredacted transcript"" of the call Trump made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during which Trump encouraged the Ukrainians to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.  It also came on the same day House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi announced  a formal impeachment inquiry to investigate the allegations. On Monday McConnell  blasted Democrats  for what he said was a politicization of the issue before the facts were known. The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to meet in a classified setting Thursday with the Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and the Inspector General for the Intelligence Community Michael Atkinson where they will be asked to testify about what they know about the whistleblower complaint.  McConnell said the Intelligence Committee, which is chaired by Sen. Richard Burr, a Republican of North Carolina, would look into the issue.    ""We're going to find out what happened. In the Senate, through a process pre-established through the Intelligence Committee behind closed doors initially with the acting director of DNI,"" McConnell said. ""I think that is the responsible, rather apolitical, at least bipartisan way to proceed with what we think we know at this particular point."" Burr was tight-lipped Monday about how his committee would respond to the complaint, although finally said he want to ""bring the interested parties in"" before the committee.  The top Democrat on the committee is Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.  ""This is one step in a process. This is an orderly process, where the Committee, the full Committee, will get a chance to hear from both the IC Inspector General,  Mr. (Michael) Atkinson , and the Acting DNI, Admiral Maguire,"" Warner said.  ""But again, we're going to take this one step at a time, and I think it's terribly important to get the facts."" A Senate Democrat source told CNN that Democrats are trying to remain focused on obtaining the whistleblower complaint itself despite Trump's announcement Tuesday he will release the transcript from his call with Zelensky. The thinking is, per this source, that the concerns about Trump's conduct do not hinge completely on what is in the transcript. Multiple sources have also noted that the Democrats maintain the acting DNI is required to provide the complaint to Congress by law. The second-ranking Republican, Sen. John Thune, did not say if Republicans will insist the administration turn over the whistleblower's formal complaint. ""We'll know a lot more when the Intel Committee meets with them this week,"" Thune said. ""If it's an intelligence related issue then it probably falls under the committee's jurisdiction and I'm sure they will be anxious to get all those answers."" Also Tuesday, the Senate adopted by unanimous consent a resolution authored by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urging the administration to provide the full compliant to Congress. Schumer, D-New York, said the resolution was ""aimed at a recalcitrant executive branch, which has blocked the ability for the committees to see the complaint, even though the law requires it."" McConnell said Republicans would go along with the resolution in the spirit that it would assist the Intelligence Committee conduct its investigation. "

"The explosive charge is among the reasoning cited in Inspector General of the Intelligence Committee Michael Atkinson's  report  which said the  complaint by a whistleblower , which detailed the July 25 call and other moves by the Trump administration regarding Ukraine, amounts to an ""urgent concern"" and ""appears credible"" -- two statutory requirements considered as whistleblower allegations progress through review. ""In the ICIG's judgment, alleged conduct by a senior US public official to seek foreign assistance to interfere in or influence a Federal election... would also potentially expose such a US public official (or others acting in concert with the US public official) to serious national security and counterintelligence risks with respect to foreign intelligence services aware of such alleged conduct,"" Atkinson wrote. Despite the inspector general's transmitting of the whistleblower's complaint to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire along with his finding of ""urgent concern"" in late August, the complaint was not sent to Congress until this week. In testimony before the House Intelligence Committee Thursday, Maguire  said  that he consulted with the White House counsel's office and later the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel after receiving the complaint for guidance on how to handle it. In its guidance, which Maguire has said was ""binding,"" the Justice Department disputed Atkinson's determination that the complaint constituted an ""urgent concern,"" therefore releasing the DNI from an obligation to send it to Congress. On Thursday, Maguire defended his decisions, calling the situation ""unprecedented."" He said that ""executive privilege"" concerns regarding the President's phone call also prevented his release of the complaint to Congress. ""It was not stonewalling,"" Maguire told lawmakers. ""I have to comply with the way the law is, not the way some people would like it to be. And if I could have done otherwise, it would have been much more convenient for me."" Atkinson's letter substantiating the whistleblower's ""urgent concern"" and credibility, dated August 26, was released by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Thursday morning. In his argument, Atkinson also cites Trump's own words from a recent executive order about the ""extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States"" posed by foreign interference in US elections.  Atkinson said he also established the whistleblower's credibility, revealing new details about his or her connection to the information in the allegations, while also acknowledging the whistleblower's potential political bias.  Though much of the whistleblower's complaint is based on information attributed to unnamed US officials as well as news reports, Atkinson wrote in his analysis that the whistleblower has ""official and authorized access to the information and sources referenced"" in the complaint. The whistleblower also has ""subject matter expertise related to much of the material information"" in the complaint, Atkinson wrote. Atkinson is aware of the whistleblower's identity, he wrote.  In its two-week preliminary review of the allegations, the ICIG office ""identified some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,"" though Atkinson adds that that evidence ""did not change my determination that the complaint relating to the urgent concern 'appears credible', particularly given the other information the ICIG obtained during its preliminary review.""

"Rep. Chris Stewart, Rep. Jim Jordan and Ed Henry discuss the whistleblower complaint and the Democrats' case for impeachment. Utah  Republican Rep. Chris Stewart announced on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle"" and on social media late Wednesday that the explosive  whistleblower  complaint concerning President Trump's July call with Ukraine's leader has been declassified -- and Stewart said that it doesn't contain any damning information. ""I encourage you all to read it,"" Stewart tweeted. The complaint was not immediately available to the public, but was expected to be released Thursday morning. ""It's been declassified and it's been released,"" Stewart separately told anchor Laura Ingraham. ""So it should be available for everyone to go and look at."" Stewart added that he has personally viewed the complaint, and was initially ""anxious"" before he took a look -- but now is ""much more confident than I was this morning that this is going to go nowhere. ... there are just no surprises there."" TRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALLEGES BIDEN CORRUPTION, SAYS DEMS THREATENED UKRAINE AID MULTIPLE TIMES He continued, ""The entirety of it is focused on this one thing, and that's the transcript of one phone call, the transcript that was released this morning."" The major development came hours before Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was set to testify before Congress on Thursday. Fox News is told there was serious conversation among lawmakers as to how far Maguire could go in an open session at the hearing. One source tells Fox News the administration may have declassified the document so it could be discussed publicly during the hearing. On Wednesday, Maguire flatly contradicted  a report in The Washington Post , and asserted that he never considered resigning over the whistleblower matter or for any other reason. A bipartisan select group of intelligence committee lawmakers in the House and Senate, who have been demanding details of the whistleblower's complaint, were granted  access  to the document in a secure and classified setting earlier Wednesday ahead of Maguire's testimony. Earlier in the day, the White House  released a declassified transcript  of Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, showing Trump sought a review of former Vice President Joe Biden's efforts to have Ukraine's former top prosecutor fired. Joe Biden  has acknowledged   on camera  that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire that prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm  Burisma Holdings  — where Hunter Biden had a  highly lucrative role  on the board paying him tens of thousands of dollars per month, despite limited relevant expertise. Shokin himself had been widely accused of corruption, while  critics charged  that Hunter Biden might have been essentially selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. Trump made the request on the call for Ukraine to look into the Bidens after Zelensky first mentioned Ukraine's corruption issues, and after Trump separately requested as a ""favor"" that Ukraine  help investigate foreign interference in the 2016 elections , including the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server involving the data security company CrowdStrike. Multiple news outlets -- including The New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, and The Washington Post -- inaccurately reported that the ""favor"" related specifically to investigating Biden. READ THE FULL TRANSCRIPT OF THE TRUMP PHONE CALL ""I guarantee as the President of Ukraine that all the investigations will be done openly and candidly,"" Zelensky said in the transcript. That prompted Trump to remark, ""Good, because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good. ... he was shut down and that's really unfair. ... The other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me."" The  transcript  did not demonstrate that Trump leveraged military aid to Ukraine to obtain a ""promise"" on a Biden investigation, as a widely cited  report in The Washington Post  had claimed. Meanwhile, lawyers for the whistleblower – a member of the intelligence community – confirmed to Fox News on Wednesday that the whistleblower wanted to testify before Congress and was waiting on possible guidance from Maguire. The lawyers also confirmed to Fox News they had worked with a nonprofit to  establish a GoFundMe page  seeking to raise an initial $100,000 for the whistleblower's legal defense. The whirlwind turn of events came as President Trump has continued his efforts to turn the tables on Democrats. WHISTLEBLOWER SETS UP GOFUNDME, WANTS $100G At a press conference in New York on Wednesday, Trump specifically called attention to a little-discussed CNN  report  from May, which described how Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez, Dick Durbin, and Patrick Leahy pushed Ukraine’s top prosecutor not to close four investigations perceived as critical to then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe -- and, by Democrats' current logic, seemingly implied that their support for U.S. aid to Ukraine was at stake. ""The Democrats have done what they're accusing me of doing,"" Trump said. The Democratic senators wrote  in a  letter  to Ukraine's leader at the time: ""In four short years, Ukraine has made significant progress in building [democratic] institutions despite ongoing military, economic, and political pressure from Moscow. We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump."" The senators called for the top prosecutor to “reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.” The Post's Marc Thiessen  initially flagged the letter  on Tuesday, calling it evidence of a ""double standard"" among Democrats. ""Senator Chris Murphy literally threatened the president of Ukraine that if he doesn't do things right, they won't have Democrat support in Congress,"" Trump added. That was a reference to the  Connecticut Democrat's comments  at a bipartisan meeting in Kiev earlier this month when Murphy called U.S. aid the “most important asset” of Ukraine -- then issued a warning. ""I told Zelensky that he should not insert himself or his government into American politics,"" Murphy said, according to The Hill. ""I cautioned him that complying with the demands of the President's campaign representatives to investigate a political rival of the President would gravely damage the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. There are few things that Republicans and Democrats agree on in Washington these days, and support for Ukraine is one of them."" Responding to Trump's statements, Murphy said that ""in the meeting Republican Senator Ron Johnson and I had with President Zelensky three weeks ago, I made it clear to him that Ukraine should not become involved in the 2020 election and that his government should communicate with the State Department, not the president's campaign. I still believe this to be true."" Trump's comments came shortly after he wrapped up a  joint media  appearance with Zelensky -- who flatly  told reporters  that he did not feel ""pushed"" to investigate Joe Biden. “We had a great phone call,” Zelensky said earlier, as he sat across from Trump. “It was normal.” In colorful language, Trump told reporters that the evidence clearly showed Democrats were disingenuously attacking him for political gain. ""We have the greatest economy we've ever had,"" the president said. ""When you see little [House Intelligence Committee Chair] Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mic, smart guy by the way. ... Then he goes into a room with [House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry] Nadler, and they must laugh their asses off."" Not all Democrats in the House have been on board with the impeachment inquiry announced Tuesday by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. 2020 presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, said Wednesday that the Ukraine transcript  did not present a ""compelling"" reason  to impeach the president. Taking the fight to the Democrats over the scores of Democrats who do support an impeachment inquiry could pay dividends for Republicans ahead of next year's elections. The National Republican Congressional Committee indicated Wednesday that its fundraising was up 608 percent after Democrats' impeachment push. ""They must laugh their asses off."" And the Trump reelection campaign and GOP announced they had raised a combined $5 million in just 24 hours. Trump on Wednesday also called for transparency ""from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China."" After Trump spoke, political scientist Ian Bremmer said the real scandal wasn't Biden's pressure to get rid of Ukraine's prosecutor, but Hunter Biden's lucrative business work in Ukraine. Hunter Biden took a key position at Burisma shortly after Joe Biden visited Ukraine in 2014 and pushed officials there to greatly increase natural gas production. Hunter made tens of thousands of dollars a month but had no relevant credentials. ""Impossible to justify $50k/month for Hunter Biden serving on a Ukrainian energy board w zero expertise unless he promised to sell access,"" Bremmer wrote. ""That’s a problem for the Vice President, but completely unrelated to Biden urging Ukraine President to fire his Special Prosecutor,"" Bremmer continued. ""[The prosecutor] was corrupt, refused to investigate anyone, and who Dems and GOP agreed needed to go."" Also during the day, the Justice Department – in a new letter from the Office of Legal Counsel obtained by Fox News –pushed back on the claim that the whistleblower brought out something of “urgent concern” that would have to be turned over to Congress. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The letter also said the intelligence community inspector general found “some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,” but still said the allegations “appeared credible.” Fox News previously reported that, according to a source, the individual also did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the phone call. Sources, meanwhile, said the original allegations spoke to a possible campaign finance violation, but the DOJ concluded that Trump’s request for an investigation did not qualify as a “thing of value” for his campaign – and therefore did not constitute a criminal violation. Fox News’ Chad Pergram, Alex Pappas, Ed Henry, Jake Gibson, Catherine Herridge, Kevin Corke and Brooke Singman contributed to this report."
"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden addresses whistleblower complaint, says if President Trump does not fully cooperate with a congressional investigation then Congress will have no choice but to initiate impeachment. Former Vice President Joe Biden called Tuesday for impeachment proceedings against President Trump if his administration continues ""stonewalling"" Congress, blasting the president anew over his alleged attempt to pressure  Ukraine  to investigate the Biden family. The Democratic presidential candidate, speaking in Delaware, stopped short of endorsing outright  impeachment,  but the statement signaled he is opening the door to those proceedings -- which many of his primary rivals have already demanded. PELOSI TO ADDRESS GROUNDSWELL OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT CALLS INSIDE CAUCUS, AMID UKRAINE FUROR “It is time for the Congress to formally investigate the conduct of this president,” Biden said Tuesday, saying that Trump “should stop stonewalling” House committee investigations into his alleged misconduct. “If the president does not comply with requests from Congress … Donald Trump will leave Congress no choice, in my view, but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said. “That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.” Biden’s comments come after Trump vowed to release the transcript of a now-controversial phone call over the summer with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The move came after it was confirmed that the White House froze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine shortly before Trump allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. The White House contended that the reason for the freeze was tied to concerns about corruption. Multiple administration sources told Fox News on Tuesday that Trump wanted to be confident that the incoming Zelensky administration was going to take steps to end corruption before releasing the money. The aid to Ukraine also came up in the context of other countries and questions about whether they were paying their share, sources said. Trump, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, insisted he only sought to hold up the Ukraine aid because he “wanted other countries to pay.” “There was no quid pro quo,” Trump said. “There was no pressure applied, nothing.” A day earlier, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine’s investigative actions. “No I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said, also calling the Biden’s actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” and adding: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. … Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?” The furor began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week, involving claims that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Zelensky. A person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have “firsthand knowledge” of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, but Democrats nonetheless want to see the complaint. Biden demanded that the administration make the complaint available to Congress, along with other documents and information that's been requested. Biden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump and his allies have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate's role,  including that he apparently threatened to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine. As it happens, Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being overly soft on corruption. But Trump has claimed Shokin “was after” Hunter Biden, suggesting that Joe Biden was out to protect his son. FLASHBACK: TRUMP SAYS CLINTON-UKRAINE ALLEGATIONS WILL BE INVESTIGATED “The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” on Monday. “I can take the political attacks,” Biden countered Tuesday. “They’ll come and they’ll go, and in time they’ll soon be forgotten.” “But,"" he added, ""if we allow a president to get away with shredding the U.S. Constitution, that will last forever.

"What was learned from the rough transcript of President Trump's phone call with Ukraine's leader? KEENE, N.H. –  Sen. Elizabeth Warren  spotlighted her longstanding calls for the impeachment of President Trump at a campaign event on Wednesday, emphasizing, “I hope we do this and I hope we do this quickly.” But, she also appeared to unintentionally swipe at a rival Democrat vying for the White House –  former Vice President Joe Biden  – over his family’s role in the  Ukraine controversy  that led the House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. Taking questions from reporters following a town hall event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on the board of a foreign company if she were president. Warren quickly answered, “no.” WARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN FOR TOP SPOT IN RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION When asked why, she said, in a rare moment where she appeared flustered: “I don’t know. I have to go back and look at the details.” The ""details"" to which Warren was referring are from the two ethics plans she's unveiled to tackle corruption in government. Her campaign later clarified to the Washington Post that the plans wouldn't prevent any child of a vice president from serving on such a board. Warren’s comments came hours after the White House released a transcript of Trump’s call from this past July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The readout showed that the president asked Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated allegations regarding the Biden family’s dealings with Ukraine. However, the transcript did not suggest Trump leveraged U.S. military aid to Ukraine to obtain a “promise” of an investigation. Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company owned by one of the country’s oligarchs while Biden served in then-President Obama’s administration. The then-vice president pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at that company. The prosecutor – who also had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed. TRUMP TRIES TO TURN TABLES ON DEMOCRATS IN UKRAINE CONTROVERSY Trump on Wednesday emphasized that there was no quid pro quo during his call with the Ukrainian president, saying, “I didn’t do it.” Trump spoke with reporters one day after House Democrats kicked off their formal impeachment inquiry. They’re investigating whether the Republican president broke the law by allegedly asking a foreign nation to interfere in the 2020 election by asking for Ukraine’s assistance in investigating the Bidens.

       (Fox News) Warren kicked off her event – in front of a crowd estimated at 900 people by her campaign – by emphasizing, “nobody’s above the law... not even the president.” And, she repeated her call that “it is time for impeachment now.” The Massachusetts senator was one of the first 2020 Democrats to call for Trump’s impeachment. She did it this past spring, citing findings from then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report. Asked if she had any confidence that the GOP-controlled Senate would take action if the House impeached Trump, Warren told reporters, “I don’t know what the Senate will do under (Majority Leader) Mitch McConnel’s control, but right now we have to do what is right regardless of the politics.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN She continued, “Donald Trump had established he believed that he was above the law, and that’s what the Mueller report shows, that he obstructed justice, and he was not held accountable by our Congress. So, he came back in the summer and did it again, inviting a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election.” Warren’s stop in New Hampshire came a day after  a new poll indicated  that she held a slight two-point advantage over Biden in the crucial primary state.

"Senate Minority Leader Schumer says it is the Senate's duty to take the 'national security matter seriously'; chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge reports from Washington. The whistleblower who sparked a mounting controversy over  President Trump’s  July phone call with Ukraine’s president did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the conversation, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News -- even as the issue fuels impeachment calls from Democrats. The source said that it is made clear  in the complaint itself that the whistleblower  did not have direct knowledge of the July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. UKRAINE CONTROVERSY TURNS INTO DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR BIDEN Fox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials are on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower is not one of those people. It's unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation, or learned of it another way. Democrats, meanwhile, have seized on allegations  that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden family’s dealings, citing those claims to revive calls for impeachment. Trump has denied wrongdoing. The new details, though, have fed into skepticism about the allegations from Trump’s allies in Congress, with some likening it to how Democrats  rushed to call for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s impeachment  last week. Some Democrats backed off after The New York Times had to amend an explosive story on new college-era allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh to make clear that the alleged victim did not have any recollection of the alleged episode. On Fox News’ “Outnumbered Overtime,” GOP Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah likened the two situations and called for restraint regarding the whistleblower complaint. “I think it’s fair to just take a breath, and say let's just find out the facts and see what happens,” he said. CNN first reported  on questions about the whistleblower's direct knowledge of communications with Ukraine's leader. In spite of those questions, the complaint has resulted in a showdown with Congress, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire refused to share details of it with lawmakers. Democrats are pressing for the release of documents related to the complaint. Biden on Monday tweeted, ""release the transcript of the call."" GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN “I write to urge that you and the Senate Republican majority take immediate action to stop President Trump from withholding an intelligence community whistleblower complaint that by law must be transmitted to Congress, and to begin an investigation into the administration’s handling of security assistance to Ukraine,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls for impeachment inspired by other alleged Trump transgressions, said Sunday that unless Maguire provides information about the whistleblower complaint to Congress, administration officials ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation."" But in a letter last week, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ODNI), Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of ""urgent concern."" He said the complaint ""concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision."" The inspector general for the intelligence community has clashed with the ODNI on the matter, however, and has advocated for the complaint's release to Congress. Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to return focus to Biden. Trump allies have claimed Biden’s son, Hunter, improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioned whether his father, the onetime vice president, helped protect him by seeking the ouster of prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was looking into the company's owner. Trump, in a Sunday night tweet, said the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin. Hunter Biden was hired by Burisma in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted by protesters and as his father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Two years later, Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless Shokin was fired. Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner. “The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” Monday. Fox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But the controversy flew largely under the radar until now. While the heat is on Trump over whether he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context. Fox News’ Catherine Herridge, Chad Pergram and Ronn Blitzer and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi claims President Trump's behavior undermines the integrity of U.S. elections; chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel reports from Capitol Hill. House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., responded Thursday to allegations that the Trump White House sought to limit access to the written record of a now-controversial call between the president and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky by calling it “a cover-up” -- suggesting the Democratic caucus will plow ahead with its impeachment inquiry. Pelosi spoke to reporters after the release of a whistleblower complaint regarding  Trump’s July call  with Zelensky. The complaint said officials tried to ""lock down"" records of the call, in which Trump sought Ukraine's help investigating the Biden family. “This is a cover up,” Pelosi said. “Here we are with another example of the disregard for the Constitution by the president.” READ THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT Pelosi added: “When you have a system for electronic storage that is specifically not used and you have something that is politically helpful for the president and you hide it someplace else, that is a cover-up.” During a separate hearing on Capitol Hill, however, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire cautioned against jumping to conclusions on allegations of a ""cover-up"" and more, noting the complaint was not based on direct knowledge. “This is second-hand information from a whistleblower,” Maguire said regarding the “cover-up” claim. Pelosi’s comments come as the unnamed whistleblower’s complaints were made public, two days after she announced that the House was opening a formal impeachment inquiry over the issue. The complaint alleges Trump abused the power of his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"" in next year's U.S. election. On the call, Trump urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption. DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE   Trump has denied doing anything wrong and says the record of the call, which was released publicly on Wednesday, vindicates him of any wrongdoing. “The president thinks this proves his innocence, which only shows how much he doesn’t understand right from wrong,” Pelosi said.  The House speaker has for months brushed off calls from her party’s more liberal members to open impeachment proceedings against Trump, but Thursday she bristled at the assertion that she had changed her mind about going forward.  “We wanted to have a fuller understanding of the facts,” she said. “I didn’t change my mind.” “The president of the United States and his actions with a telephone call with another head of state betrayed his oath of office,” Pelosi added. “We have to have an inquiry to further the facts.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As of Wednesday, a majority of House members have publicly supported impeachment proceedings against Trump, with 217 Democrats and independent Rep. Justin Amash all being in favor of opening the inquiry into the president.  One House member not supporting the impeachment push is House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who in his weekly press briefing said that Pelosi opened the inquiry without any evidence against Trump. ""She opened [an] impeachment inquiry without even seeing one word of evidence,"" he said. ""[E]ven her own members questioned that she moved too soon. And when the evidence was released the Democrats, and many of the media, twisted it to what they wanted to believe."" Before the recent scandal involving the phone call with the Ukrainian president, numerous Democrats had pushed impeachment proceedings or even outright impeachment – mostly over the results of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Trump campaign links to Russia and whether Trump attempted to obstruct the probe.  That probe did not reach a conclusion on the obstruction issue and did not find evidence of collusion. Pelosi’s statement earlier in the week marks the first time Democratic Party leadership has gotten behind the impeachment effort. "

"President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani on his conversation with Ukraine officials. Rudy Giuliani,  the personal lawyer for  President Trump,  continued his broadside against the Bidens and their relationship with Ukraine, but also appeared to cast an even wider net,  accusing Democrats of doing their best to cover up a ""pattern of corruption"" involving top members of the Obama cabinet. EXCLUSIVE: Official says watchdog found whistleblower had 'political bias' against Trump ""We know corrupt Ukrainian oligarch laundered $3 million to the Biden Family,” he tweeted. ""But $3 to $4m more was laundered to Biden. So release all the financial records of all businesses involving Biden, Kerry’s stepson and notorious mobster Whitey Bulger’s nephew."" Giuliani was referring to Joe Biden’s son Hunter; Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry; and James Bulger, the nephew of notorious mobster Whitey Bulger. The Washington Examiner  reported  this week that Hunter Biden's decision to join the board of the Ukrainian firm, Burisma Holdings, back in 2014, was enough to make Heinz, his business partner, raise questions with the State Department and later severed ties with the Biden. The New Yorker recently ran an  extensive article  about Hunter Biden and mentioned several instances where he could have been perceived as using his father's position to help his career. In 2013, Hunter Biden flew with his father to China aboard Air Force 2 before he secured a $1.5 billion deal from a subsidiary of the Bank of China. “You want to know why the secretary of state (Kerry) wasn't particularly upset about it? Because his son was getting money too. Isn't it a coincidence that China sends $1.5 billion to a private equity fund? There were only three owners: Biden’s son, Kerry's son, and Whitey Bulger’s nephew,” Giuliani told the Examiner. Giuliani's tweets came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump focused partly on whether he abused his presidential powers and sought help from a foreign government to undermine Joe Biden and help his own reelection. In a summer phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump is accused of asking for help investigating the Bidens. In the days before the call, Trump ordered advisers to freeze $400 million in military aid for Ukraine — prompting speculation that he was holding out the money as leverage for information on the Bidens. Trump has denied that charge, but acknowledged he blocked the funds, later released. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden said Tuesday, before Pelosi’s announcement, that if Trump doesn’t cooperate with lawmakers’ demands for documents and testimony in its investigations the president “will leave Congress ... with no choice but to initiate impeachment.” The Associated Press contributed to this report"
"Romney came to Washington promising to speak out against the President when the time called for it. Days ago, he became the first prominent elected Republican to convey his dismay about Trump asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on Biden, one of Trump's political rivals for the White House, and Biden's son at a time when Trump was withholding aid to Ukraine. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or Hunter Biden. There were some signs on Wednesday evening that other Republican voices, including one GOP senator who had read the whisteblower complaint in a secure setting, that Romney may no longer be alone in his concerns. Romney stood his ground on Wednesday after reading the call summary of the discussion between Trump and Zelensky. ""My reaction was the same as (the one) I had a few days ago, which is -- this remains deeply troubling,"" Romney said during an interview at The Atlantic Festival on Wednesday. ""We'll see where it leads, but the first reaction is troubling."" Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican up for election in 2020, echoed those thoughts after reading the complaint on Wednesday evening. ""This (is) going to take a long time but there's obviously some very troubling things here. But I think the partisan tribalism that's always insta-certain is a terrible idea. There are real troubling things here. Republicans ought not just circle the wagons and Democrats ought not be using words like 'impeach' before they knew anything about the actual substance."" Other senators had criticisms for the President as well. Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, called Trump's conversation with Zelensky ""inappropriate"" in a statement earlier in the day. GOP Ohio Sen. Rob Portman also told CNN's Manu Raju that nothing in the transcript surprised him. ""It was exactly what I expected."" But when pressed about whether Trump should have asked the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden, Portman added: ""It didn't surprise me, because he said he did. I would rather have seen that—yes—he should not have."" It was on Sunday that Romney tweeted that ""if the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out."" That made him the first Republican to forcefully express concern with Trump's actions. The Trump White House clearly believed Wednesday that releasing details of the July 25 conversation -- as well as sending the related whistleblower complaint to Congress -- would clear up the matter for their opponents and doubters, and perhaps ease some of the pressure for impeachment proceedings in the US House. But as lawmakers parsed the sentences of the call summary on Wednesday, the opposite seemed true. Still, most Republicans swiftly fell in line with the administration's argument that the call summary showed there was no direct quid pro quo. Romney, on the other hand, continued to say he wanted to see all the information, including the allegations contained in the whistleblower complaint that the White House is sending over to Congress. Romney sidestepped a question at The Atlantic Festival about whether he saw the implication of a quid pro quo in the call summary. The Utah senator explained he ""wasn't as focused"" on the potential quid pro quo aspect of the call as others, but added: ""If the President of the United States asks or presses the leader of a foreign country to carry out an investigation of a political nature that's troubling, and I feel that."" To underscore his point, the Utah senator pointed to the extraordinary power of the presidency, as well as the House and the Senate. ""I think it's very natural for people to look at circumstances and see them in the light that's most amenable to maintaining their power and doing things to preserve their power,"" Romney said when asked by the moderator why he was virtually alone among GOP officials in highlighting the seriousness of the potential offense by the President. Perhaps as a way of explaining Trump's motivation for talking to Zelensky about Biden and his son -- and his party's inclination to defend the President, Romney noted that both parties feel deeply that if the opposing party were in charge ""terrible things would happen for the country ... and it's critical for them to hold on to their leadership."" ""I think it's just in human nature to see things in a way that is consistent with your own world view and your sense of what's necessary for the preservation of your position of power,"" Romney said. ""I don't know why I'm not afflicted to the same degree as perhaps others are in that regard. Maybe it's because I'm old and have done other things."" The Utahn declined to wade into the impeachment debate, stating that the House was considering the President's actions and that he wasn't going to ""give advice to Speaker Pelosi."" When Romney was elected to the Senate from the deep red state of Utah, he promised that he would stand up to Trump if he believed he was wrong. That was appreciated by his constituents who -- though overwhelmingly Republican -- generally give lower marks to Trump than voters in other red states. ""He's got a pretty strong moral compass,"" said Lanhee Chen, who advised Romney on foreign policy during his 2012 run for the White House. ""He was going to speak his mind without regard to party or politics, and this is very much in line with that,"" said Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution and lecturer in the public policy program at Stanford University. ""He has great concern about what he sees as potential misuse or malfeasance in office."""
"Reaction from marijuana rights advocate Mason Tvert and 'Tell Your Children' author Alex Berenson. The  House of Representatives  passed a bill Wednesday that provides safe harbor to banks that work with  legal marijuana  businesses, removing a significant roadblock to growth in the budding cannabis  industry .  Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., announced last week that the chamber would vote on the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act – known as the SAFE Banking Act – which is the less ambitious of two marijuana-related bills  congressional leadershi p  had been considering for months. It passed 321-103, with 91 Republicans voting for it and Alabama Rep. Terri Sewell the only Democrat voting against it.  The legislation faces an uncertain fate in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been reluctant to bring up marijuana-related bills.    ""Thousands of employees, businesses and communities across this country have been forced to deal in piles of cash because of the conflict between state and federal law,"" Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo., a bill sponsor, said after the measure passed Wednesday. ""After six years of working on this bill, the SAFE Banking Act will go a long way in getting cash off our streets and providing certainty so financial institutions can work with cannabis businesses and employees."" 
      The SAFE Banking Act would offer protections for banks and financial institutions against sanctions for working with marijuana companies. Some worry it could help large corporations investing in marijuana more than the average small business owner.
       (Ben Brown // Fox News) TEENS, PREGNANT WOMEN URGED NOT TO SMOKE POT BY SURGEON GENERAL: 'THIS AIN'T YOUR MOTHER'S MARIJUANA' The SAFE Banking Act would allow cannabis businesses to access financial services that have long been difficult to find due to their gray-area status — often legal in their individual state but illegal federally. Even cannabis businesses like hemp growers and CBD manufacturers that don't work directly with THC, the intoxicating chemical in marijuana, have struggled to access banking services due to trepidation that still hangs over the industry. Under the bill, marijuana businesses would be able to open accounts, take on loans, accept credit cards and deposit money into banks that now seldom associate with them for fear of repercussions from the federal government.  Those services will be important for a sector that added  64,389 jobs  in 2018, according to a report by Leafly and Whitney Economics, and could grow even more as pot laws continue to loosen across the United States.  Scott Van Rixel, CEO of Bhang, a company that manufactures CBD candies and licenses THC products to state and provincial license holders, said giving cannabis companies access to general financial services would give the industry an air of stability and help it grow. YOUNG CHILDREN GETTING THEIR HANDS ON MARIJUANA-INFUSED BROWNIES, GUMMIES IN LEGAL STATES, POISON CONTROL CENTERS SAY “Investors are going to have greater faith in the industry with access to traditional banking and the traditional credit card process,” he said. “Vendors and business to business are [also] going to be more comfortable if you know they can use standardized wires, standardized banking, write a check, get a wire without fear of reprisal or their bank account getting shut down.” Safety is an issue, too. Many cannabis companies – like TILT Holdings, which raked in $39 million in earnings last quarter – are forced to do their business largely in cash, putting employees at risk of being robbed.  “It is imperative that we do everything possible to protect people working within the industry,” TILT Holdings Chief Operating Officer Tim Conder said.  But Kevin Sabet, who advised the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations on drug policy, warns that SAFE Banking Act is a corporate giveaway in sheep’s clothing. CDC SAYS ONE IN 10 MARIJUANA USERS BECOME ADDICTED “It’s going to create another big tobacco and big pharma industry and it never ends well for public health,” he told Fox News. “Today’s marijuana is much more harmful than it used to be. It’s not Woodstock weed anymore.” Sabet noted that Altria and Phillip Morris, two of the largest tobacco companies in the world, are invested in marijuana. So are many big alcohol companies.  “This isn’t about social justice at all, this is about enriching for-profit companies,” he said.  Some progressive Democrats say simply letting marijuana businesses work with banks isn’t enough.  AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT DIVERTED TO DENVER AFTER UNRULY PASSENGER REPORTEDLY SMOKES WEED ON BOARD The most comprehensive cannabis bill in Congress right now is the  Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act , known as the MORE Act, which has support from Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Rep. Jerrold Nadler, R-N.Y., among others. The bill, which would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and implement social justice programs for those affected by the ‘War on Drugs,’ would likely have a more difficult time clearing the Senate and getting President Donald Trump’s signature than the SAFE Banking Act. Legal-pot activists and progressives had beseeched House members to take up the MORE Act first, worrying Congress would stop with the SAFE Banking Act. In a move to potentially assuage those fears and round up votes for Wednesday, Nadler committed to a markup of the MORE Act Tuesday night. ""The House is expected to consider the SAFE Banking Act on the floor tomorrow and I will vote for it,"" he said in a  statement . ""As the sponsor of the MORE Act, I also strongly support additional marijuana reform...."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sabet is skeptical about the MORE Act, too.  “This is not going to be an industry that produces social justice. It’s going to be an industry that perpetuates social injustice, as it already is,” he said."

"The mishap adds another surreal layer to Wednesday's swirl of events. A  White House transcript of a July phone call  between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky reveals Trump's efforts to pressure his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter,  further ratcheting up talk among Democrats  to conduct an impeachment investigation. ""The transcript clearly shows there was no quid pro quo or anything else inappropriate about the conversation between President Trump and President (Volodymr) Zelenskyy,"" one of the talking points says. Although the transcript doesn't explicitly tie military aid to his expressed desire for an investigation into Biden, he does tell Zelensky, ""I would like you to do us a favor."" The White House's talking points also include that Trump's phone call was ""entirely proper"" and that the ""real scandal"" is that leaks about Trump's phone call with a foreign leader had led to ""false accusations"" and ""forced the President to release the transcript."" Democratic Reps. Anthony Brown and Bill Pascrell, whose offices received the email, both shared the talking points on Twitter.  The White House transcript  released  Wednesday shows that Trump repeatedly pushed for Zelensky to investigate Biden, and his son, Hunter, during a July 25 phone call. The President also asked the Ukrainian leader to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and US Attorney General William Barr on the issue, the  call memo  shows. There has been  no evidence of wrongdoing  by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Raising more questions about the President's intentions, The  Washington Post  first reported on Monday that Trump had directed his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million of US military and security aid to Ukraine in the days before he spoke with Zelensky. Trump  admitted  that he did delay aid to Ukraine, but claimed that it was unrelated to Biden. Ahead of the transcript release, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday a  formal impeachment inquiry  into the President  -- a dramatic and historic move as Trump faced outrage over the reports that he pressured a foreign leader in an effort to target a political rival.

"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in New York on Monday to take part in the United Nations General Assembly. But his debut on the world stage has already been overshadowed by  questions about a July 25 conversation  with US President Donald Trump.  In the latest development, two senior administration officials said Trump requested a hold on millions in  military aid  to Ukraine roughly one week before a call in which Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son.  Trump  tweeted Tuesday  he has ""authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" of his phone call with Zelensky, and said there was ""no pressure, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!"" Leave aside for a moment whether that was ever likely to happen: Andriy Yermak, an aide to Zelensky, said in an interview published Monday that Ukraine would not open or close investigations ""on command.""  Many Ukrainians are concerned the US political drama benefits their powerful neighbor, Russian President Vladimir Putin.  In an interview with CNN, former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin said that the scandal surrounding the telephone conversation is undermining Ukraine's fight against Russia, which occupied and annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has backed separatists in the country's east.  Klimkin said the scandal will undermine Kiev and play into the hands of Putin. Asked to guess what the Kremlin is likely thinking about the Trump phone scandal, Klimkin said: ""They are definitely (thinking), 'Open the champagne.' For them it is the best way to drive a wedge in (the) unique -- and I really mean unique -- bipartisan support for Ukraine. (The) United States for the past five years has been the most important ally, not only in the sense of military aid, not only in the sense of pressure and sanctions but fundamentally leading the international community, so now the Russians should be crazy happy about it.""  Klimkin told CNN he has no direct knowledge of what was discussed in the Trump phone call. He has not seen a transcript or been briefed on the call despite holding the position of foreign minister at the time, because he had submitted his resignation before the call.  But many Ukrainians are learning about what it means to be pulled into a US domestic political drama.  On CNN, journalist and former Ukrainian government official Serhiy Leshchenko appeared on ""Cuomo Prime Time""  to counter a false allegation  by Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani said a Ukrainian court had found Leshchenko guilty of producing a phony affidavit given to US officials to intervene in American elections. On Twitter, Leshchenko said he appeared on the show to ""confront disinformation statements of Rudy Giuliani about me and Ukraine,"" adding: ""We are looking for bipartisan support of Ukraine to make ... Europe (a) safer place."" Daria Kaleniuk, an anti-corruption activist in Ukraine, made a similar point. The main beneficiary of the scandal, she argued on Twitter, was Russia. ""Both Ukraine and the US are (losing),""  she wrote on Twitter .  The discussion about Ukraine's future, many Ukrainians fear, is being drowned out by the noise surrounding that unusual call in July."
"NYC Councilman Joe Borelli, Democratic strategist Jessica Tarlov and FOX Nation host Kat Timpf weigh in on Joe Biden and President Trump's back and forth over Biden's dealings with Ukraine. A top  Ukrainian  official on Saturday defended  President Trump's  July phone call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during which Trump reportedly urged authorities in Kiev to investigate dealings in the Eastern European county by the son of former Vice President  Joe Biden . “I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,” Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko  told the Hromadske media outlet . ""There was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers."" Zelenskiy's office has not commented on the allegations. Trump and Zelenskiy are expected to meet in person at the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump had repeatedly asked Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden, who had ties to a natural gas firm that was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor as part of a corruption probe. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has suggested that Joe Biden, the current frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, worked while he was vice president to protect his son's company from being investigated. ""President Trump is interested, his advisor, Giuliani, newspapers, Democrats, Republicans are interested in whether pressure had been put on Ukraine,"" Prystaiko said during the same interview. ""I want to say that we are an independent state, we have our own secrets."" BIDEN FACES SCRUTINY FOR DEMANDING OUSTER OF UKRAINE OFFICIAL PROBING FIRM THAT EMPLOYED HIS SON Biden on Saturday denied he has ever spoken to Hunter about his business in Ukraine and called President Trump's actions an ""overwhelming abuse of power."" “Trump’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum, and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,” Biden  told reporters in Iowa  on Saturday. NEW DETAILS ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT President Trump earlier on Saturday tweeted about the ""Ukraine Witch Hunt,"" which he says is a last-ditch effort by the ""Fake News Media"" to protect Biden. ""Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone 'bust' on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden,"" Trump said.

The Fake News Media didn't want to report that ""Joe Biden [demanded] that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won’t get a very large amount of U.S. money,"" the president had said. ""[So] they fabricate a [...] story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine. Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster,"" Trump said. Giuliani also chimed in on Saturday morning, tweeting: ""Biden’s defense is, not I didn’t do it, but 'no media outlet gives any credibility to the story.' Of course they don’t.

Appearing on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live,"" Biden began by rating the ""outlandish news cycle"" with an ""18 out of 10"" and calling the controversy surrounding Trump's communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ""bizarre."" ""Rudy Giuliani is a great character witness the president has,"" Biden joked. Biden told ABC host  Jimmy Kimmel  that there's ""not one single, solitary, legitimate journalist in the world"" that has given credibility to Trump's accusations and expressed that he's ""worried about all the families that can't take care of themselves."" ""Look, we want to get his attention. I have 70 polls in a row showing me beating him, and that all of sudden gets his attention,"" Biden said. ""And so I think that's why I'm the object of his attention."" CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO ADMITS BIDEN 'ABSOLUTELY' ENGAGED IN QUID PRO QUO WITH UKRAINE, BUT NOT FOR 'PERSONAL ADVANTAGE' The 2020 frontrunner offered a reaction to the newly-released transcript of Trump's conversation with Zelensky, calling the president wanting the Department of Justice involved a ""blatant abuse of power."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Do you think it is an impeachable- this particular instance, is an impeachable offense?"" Kimmel asked. ""Based on the material that they acknowledged today, it seems to me that it's awful hard to avoid the conclusion that it is an impeachable offense and a violation of constitutional responsibility,"" Biden responded. ""But look, I am confident in the ability of the House and Senate to deal with this. My job is to go out and flat-beat him."""
"Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, called  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's demand for a narrow inquiry  focusing on  Trump's conversations with Ukraine  an ""understandable directive."" ""This Ukraine allegation is head and shoulders, one of the most serious and urgent allegations that we have seen come out of this administration to date,"" she told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""Cuomo Prime Time,"" arguing that it had convinced more lawmakers on impeachment than any other issue. Trump  repeatedly pushed for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a potential 2020 political rival , Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, during a July 25 phone call, according to a transcript of the conversation released by the White House earlier Wednesday.  On the call, Zelensky agreed to the President's request, promising that the next prosecutor general ""will look into the situation specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue."" There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Ocasio-Cortez characterized the inquiry as a chance to preemptively protect the upcoming 2020 election and stop interference before it happens. ""We have the opportunity to act now to prevent a profoundly destabilizing action and intervention in our democracy before it happens,"" she said. ""And I think that is a profoundly urgent action that we need to take right now."" While other House investigations into Trump's alleged misdeeds were important, they addressed ""things that have unfortunately already happened,"" she said."" When it comes to Ukraine we are talking about a potential meddling in the 2020 election that has still yet to happen."" Ocasio-Cortez slammed Trump as having created a national security threat and participated in ""a series of events that looks like extortion"" in delaying military aid to Ukraine and ""asking for a favor to essentially benefit (himself) politically."" Trump on Wednesday denied any wrongdoing, saying there was ""no pressure whatsoever"" in his phone call with Zelensky. He has also claimed that the delay was unrelated to Biden and that he was waiting for European nations to contribute their fair share of aid."
"On today's episode of 'The Story', Martha discusses Nancy Pelosi’s announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry; plus, President Trump condemns Iran’s ‘bloodlust.’ Ranking House Judiciary Committee member  Doug Collin s, R-Ga., slammed  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement  endorsing a formal impeachment inquiry into  President Trump , calling it a ""false and feeble decree."" “Today isn't what impeachment looks like, and this afternoon's press conference changes nothing legally,” Collins said in a statement following the speaker’s announcement on Tuesday. “There has been no House vote to authorize a formal impeachment inquiry.” He added “If Democrats believed the facts were in their favor, they would provide the due process that the House provided under the Clinton and Nixon impeachments.” PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP On Tuesday Pelosi, D-Calif., said: ""The president must be held accountable"" for his ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections."" She effectively endorsed the process, which to some degree has already been underway, after facing fresh pressure from inside the Democratic caucus to act. The move could support Democrats' disputed argument in court that impeachment proceedings were in fact in progress, which could entitle Congress to obtain additional documents. Pelosi specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky . Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal."" Trump allegedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President  Joe Biden  and his son Hunter. Joe Biden  has acknowledged  on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption. But there were several indicators throughout the day that Pelosi's gambit could backfire, as Republicans predicted over the weekend.  “No matter how many Democrats subscribe to the fantasy that the House began an impeachment inquiry—whether in March, July, August or September—neither Chairman [Jerrold] Nadler nor Speaker Pelosi have unilateral authority to launch one,"" Collins said on Tuesday night.  House Judiciary Committee Chairman  Jerrold Nadler,  D-N.Y., and fellow Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have been investigating Trump as part of what they've called impeachment proceedings. Notably, Nadler hauled Trump's former 2016 campaign manager,  Cory Lewandowski , in front of his committee last week for a combative five hours of testimony related to possible impeachable conduct by the president. AOC ON TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: 'WHAT HE HAS ADMITTED TO IS ALREADY IMPEACHABLE, REGARDLESS OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS' On Tuesday evening, Pelosi announced that multiple House committees are now moving forward with an impeachment inquiry. ""This is the first partisan 'impeachment' in the history of the republic, and the real victims are the American people,” Collins said. “They elected Donald Trump to be our president and their representatives to solve the border crisis and support a growing economy. Instead of accepting those facts, Democrats are sowing chaos, not producing legislative solutions.” He went on to say, “The chaos began in the Judiciary Committee, and now it's seeping into the rest of the House.” Trump  vowed  earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of his call with Zelensky by Wednesday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Additionally, a senior administration official told Fox News late Tuesday that the White House is working as quickly as it can to release to Congress the whistleblower complaint, as long as it's legally possible. The official told Fox News the White House had nothing to hide, that there has been no wrongdoing. Fox News’ Gregg Re and The Associated Press contributed to this report. "
"Image Bernie Sanders greeting supporters after a campaign event in Reno, Nev., this month. Credit Max Whittaker for The New York Times Bernie Sanders has gone much further than  any of the other 2020 Democratic presidential candidates  in proposing not just more money for affordable housing, or more enforcement of fair-housing laws, but also fundamental changes  in how the housing market functions .  His most startling ideas — a national rent control standard, and new taxes on land speculation and house  “flipping”  — would bring America closer to the idea that housing should be treated as shelter and not a commodity. But in the  housing plan his campaign released Wednesday , Mr. Sanders doesn’t go all the way there. He allows for profit, but not certain kinds of profit, or profit by certain kinds of actors. In that middle ground, somewhere between the private market and social housing for all, things get complicated. The national rent control standard Mr. Sanders has proposed would cap the amount that landlords can raise rents, to shield tenants from escalating housing costs and, in a deeper sense, the excesses of capitalism in the housing market. Landlords could raise the rent by no more than 3 percent per year,  or  one and a half times the rate of inflation, whichever is higher.  His housing plan says nothing about the profits of people buying and selling homes in the normal course of homeownership. In fact, Mr. Sanders would invest an additional $8 billion into federal programs to help first-time home buyers, precisely because homeownership in America is often a means of building wealth. Between the two proposals lies a fraught balance: One would curb profits in the housing market, while the other acknowledges that many Americans depend on those profits. Mr. Sanders’s campaign seeks to reconcile the two by arguing that rich investors or landlords shouldn’t get to make so much, while ordinary American families should have a chance to make something.  “We want to return to the notion that homeownership can be an asset builder for working people and average American families, and it is not just a vehicle to commodify to make the rich richer,” said Josh Orton, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign and its national policy director. In practice, however, it’s not always obvious how to distinguish the working families from the rich investors, or how to devise policies that crack down on the one but not the other. Some middle-class families, for example, build wealth by owning rental properties. And landlord groups are skeptical that 3 percent rent increases would build them much wealth, especially when property taxes, insurance rates and utilities aren’t also capped.  Mr. Sanders’s proposal would also put a hefty tax on house flipping, hitting owners who sell a property for more than the original price within five years of purchase (for a place they don’t occupy). But that definition would cover people we don’t think of as flippers: a small-scale general contractor who remodels two homes a year; a family that buys a home for an aging parent who later dies; a landlord who herself faces financial distress and must get out of the business. Mr. Sanders has similarly proposed a tax on empty homes, aimed at speculators who sit on vacant properties until they become more lucrative to redevelop, or simply profitable to resell. That is a real problem in some communities, leaving neighbors to live with blight for years. But owning an empty home doesn’t necessarily make you a speculator. Someone who has put a property on the market and struggled to sell it for months might end up facing this tax.  The full proposal, emphasizing the feel-good parts of the market but not the others, is trying to have it both ways, said Jenny Schuetz, a housing economist at the Brookings Institution who has been  following housing proposals from the 2020 candidates .  “In some ideal universe, people would buy homes (or rental properties) that appreciated slightly faster than inflation, allowing them to build wealth, but without housing costs rising too fast to pressure renters, deter new homeowners, or create excess capital gains,” Ms. Schuetz wrote in an email. “In that context, both rent control and flipping taxes make sense. The problem is, with any semblance of a private real estate market, land and housing values don’t behave that way.” She is skeptical that it is even possible to design or regulate a market that gives modest returns to individual homeowners, but never gives big returns to landlords; that penalizes greedy flippers, but never harms small-time contractors; that taxes vacant homes but doesn’t punish working families. Mr. Sanders’s ideas invite a host of questions about how they would technically work (how do we police a million landlords?) and where their legal authority would come from (would the courts uphold a national rent control law?). But these deeper questions about the kind of housing market voters might want seem worth hashing out, regardless of those other details. Mr. Orton, the Sanders adviser, pushed back against the logic of  economists  that, for one, rent control discourages developers from building and landlords from renting housing that Americans badly need. “I would say to those economists, how is that working out?” he said of the current deference to the market. “That’s what we’ve been doing. When we’ve left this to private developers, everything from the crash of the housing market to how we’ve seen gentrification just explode in some of the most vulnerable communities, to how we’ve seen people priced out of what would normally be affordable housing — this current crisis is the result of that.”"
"Presidential hopeful Joe Biden says he has never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. He calls on President Trump to release the transcript of his call with the Ukraine. Former Vice President Joe Biden  went on the offense Saturday over  President Trump’s July phone call  with the president of Ukraine, in which Trump reportedly urged the leader to investigate Biden’s son’s dealings in the country -- with Biden backing calls for a House investigation and for the White House to release the transcript of the call. “Trump’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum, and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,” he told reporters in Iowa. NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his role as VP in pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as vice president, worked to protect the company from investigation. On Saturday, Biden said that he had never spoken to Hunter about his business dealings in Ukraine, and backed calls for the House to investigate -- as well as suggesting it could begin a path to impeachment. “Depending on what the House finds, he could be impeached but I’m not making that judgment now,” he said. “The House should investigate it, this appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power.” He went on to call Trump a “serial abuser.” “He abuses power everywhere he can and if he sees any threat to staying in power, he’ll do whatever he has to do -- but this crosses the line,” he said. CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT Biden’s remarks came just hours after Trump dismissed the controversy as a “Ukraine Witch Hunt” being stoked by the Democratic Party and the “fake news media,” and said that the real scandal was to do with Biden’s interactions in the country. “The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won’t get a very large amount of U.S. money, so they fabricate a.story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine,” he tweeted. “Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. The Fake News knows this but doesn’t want to report!” What initially touched off the  controversy is a secret  whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. Trump dismissed the story as “ridiculous"" and a ""partisan hack job"" from the Oval Office on Friday and said his calls with foreign leaders are “always appropriate.” The whistleblower complaint led House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democrats to call for an investigation and for the administration hand over the complaint as well as a transcript of the call -- even as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire declined to share details with lawmakers. Maguire is expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. after being subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee. Schiff had accused Maguire of withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioned whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On Saturday Trump said that the media was turning the story into one about him, as they are trying to “protect” the Democratic frontrunner. “Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden,” he tweeted. “Will fail again!” Fox News' Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"But on Tuesday afternoon, Sanders took it even a step farther. In a tweet touting his newly unveiled plan to tax the ultra-wealthy, the Vermont senator wrote this: ""There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people."" No billionaires! As in, Sanders is going to tax them out of existence? That's not, at least according to my reading of the plan, what Sanders is actually proposing. Here's the basics of his ultra-wealth tax,  according to his website : ""It would start with a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million for a married couple. That means a married couple with $32.5 million would pay a wealth tax of just $5,000. ""The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. These brackets are halved for singles. ""Under this plan, the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over 15 years which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small privileged class."" So, Sanders' plan would significantly reduce the number of billionaires. It would not get rid of billionaires entirely. Except that, at least according to the tweet, the elimination of all billionaires is the end goal of Sanders' plan. Which is a political problem for Sanders. ""Wait, what??""  tweeted Andy Lassner , an executive producer of ""Ellen"" and a prominent liberal voice on Twitter, in response to Sanders' tweet. ""So folks like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet who have committed their vast wealth to providing clean water around the world and obliterating Polio shouldn't exist? Oprah shouldn't exist?"" If that is the reaction from the liberal left, can you imagine what President Donald Trump and his allies will do with a line like, ""There should be no billionaires?"" Trump, even at the United Nations on Tuesday, made his oft-repeated pledge that ""America will never be a socialist country."" Polling suggests that most Americans view billionaires suspiciously --  a Bloomberg poll showed just 31% said they admired billionaires  -- but there is  very little support for seeking to eliminate billionaires entirely or a large number of people who view the existence of billionaires as a policy failure by this country . Sanders' lean-in to this sort of treatment of the wealthy provides a real contrast not just to the likes of former Vice President Joe Biden but also to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who  has proposed her own tax on the extremely wealthy . ""I am a capitalist,""  she told CNBC's John Harwood in 2018 . ""Come on. I believe in markets."" Make no mistake: There is a segment within the Democratic primary who will love the idea of taxing billionaires into oblivion. But almost all of those people are already for Sanders. For everyone else in the party, they will likely see this for what it will be in the context of a general election in which Sanders is the nominee: The reddest of red meat for Donald Trump."
"Democratic lawmakers and the White House are at odds over a whistleblower complaint of an alleged promise by President Trump to a foreign leader; chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge reports from Washington. As  President Trump  faces media scrutiny over a phone call he held with  Ukraine  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Rep.  Adam Schiff , D-Calif., said he may seek to withhold funds from the  intelligence community  unless they disclose the full contents of the conversation. Schiff, who serves as the House Intel Committee chairman, appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, where host Jake Tapper asked if Schiff would be willing to put the nation at risk to get to the bottom of the cryptic report. ""It depends on what funds we withhold,"" Schiff replied. ""In this case, you have the office of the director of national intelligence that is withholding this complaint in violation of the clear letter of the law... And there are funding requests that that office makes that don’t go directly to national security that we can withhold."" The story was  first reported  by the Washington Post as a whistleblower claim about Trump making some type of ""promise"" to a foreign leader, which may have been of a nefarious nature.  Further reporting  claimed the conversation was linked to Ukraine, and Trump's request for their government to look into  2020 presidential  hopeful  Joe Biden 's son and his business dealings. GREGG JARRETT: THE TRUMP WHISTLEBLOWER MAY NOT BE A WHISTLEBLOWER AT ALL ""Look, it is a blunt remedy and one that I’m very reluctant to use,"" Schiff continued. ""At the same time, the inspector general has said this is not only serious...but it's urgent. We cannot afford to play rope-a-dope in the court for weeks or months on end. We need an answer."" Schiff also reignited the impeachment debate which seemed to be fading away, after several failed attempts by House lawmakers to oust the president from office. ""If there is a fire burning, it needs to be put out. And that's why we’re going to have to look at every remedy. And if these two issues are, in fact, one issue and it relates to deplorable conduct, a violation of the president’s oath of office... then we're going to have to consider impeachment as well,"" he said. Trump responded to the story on Twitter Thursday and again on Saturday, saying the narrative was ""fake news"" conjured up by biased members of the media.

"Per a  CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll  released Saturday, Warren has for the first time taken the lead among likely caucusgoers in that key first primary state, climbing seven points since June. And Warren appears poised to rise further if other Democrats drop out or falter in the race, given that the poll finds she's the top second choice among all other Democratic candidates. Twenty percent would choose Warren as a second choice while Biden and Bernie Sanders are each only the  second choice of 10% .  Biden still currently leads Warren in the Real Clear Politics average of polls on a national level by a  little over ten points .  But Warren has been slowly building support in a way that may not only lead her to win the nomination, but to win the White House come 2020. Why? It's simple: Warren is increasingly exciting people about her candidacy. This is backed by a new NBC/WSJ poll released Sunday which finds that among all the 2020 Democratic candidates, she is now the top-tier candidate who the largest amount of registered voters (17%) are "" enthusiastic "" about. While that number has grown from just 8 percent in March, the percentage of voters who are enthusiastic about Trump has remained the same at 26%. Biden, however, has seen the opposite trend. In March, 17% of voters were enthusiastic about him, but now the former VP has slipped to 12%. That's not good. Enthusiasm should only be growing the more people see a candidate in debates and on the campaign trail. True, enthusiasm is an intangible factor that can come and go, often quickly. But it's enthusiasm that inspires people to not just vote, but to get friends to vote. It's that passion that animates people to knock on doors for a candidate, make phone calls, give money and attend events. In fact, just this past week, we saw an example of Warren enthusiasm on display when she held a rally in New York City and some  20,000 people  reportedly attended. The massive crowd clearly unnerved Trump, who loves to brag that he draws the largest audiences. When asked about the rally by reporters, Trump did his best to downplay it,  saying , ""No. 1, she didn't have 20,000 people and No. 2, I think anybody would get a good crowd there.""  But it wasn't just the New York City rally, Warren has been  increasingly drawing impressive, energetic crowds,  such as in August when 15,000 people came to her rally in Seattle and 12,000 attended another rally in St. Paul, Minnesota.  How did Warren climb from  single digits  in national polls in March to now topping Biden in the new Iowa poll?  She hit all the right notes with Democrats and especially with the progressive wing of the party. Her debate performances have been consistently very good. Warren's  'I have a plan for that' mantra  where she has released detailed plans for policy issues facing our nation from childcare to anti-corruption to criminal justice reform --  and the list goes on  -- has resonated with voters. She has also been very outspoken on another issue supported by approximately  70% of Democrats : Impeaching Trump.  Warren was the first major presidential candidate to  call for impeaching the President  back in April, just days after Robert Mueller's report was released. And on Friday after  allegations were reported  that Trump spoke to the Ukrainian President in July and pressured him to investigate Biden and Biden's son Hunter in an obvious effort to get dirt on Biden, Warren went a step further.  She took to Twitter slamming Democrats in Congress for failing to act, writing, ""After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment. By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump's latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections.""  She added , ""Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president.""  In contrast,  Biden's first response  to reporters on the issue was understandably more defensive: ""Not one single credible outlet has given credibility to these assertions. Not one single one,"" adding, ""So I have no comment other than the president should start to be president."" Later that night Biden put out  a more forceful statement  saying if the allegations are true, it is ""clear-cut corruption.""   However, as someone who speaks to the progressives nightly on my SiriusXM radio show, I can tell you firsthand that Warren's words and sentiment line up perfectly with the frustration many rank and file Democrats have with the Democrats in Congress on this issue.  Between now and the 2020 election a great deal can change. But if Warren and Biden continue along their current trajectory, Trump should fear Warren as much, if not more, than Biden."

"This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can  sign up here  to receive it each weekday. I was prepared for the “ transcript ” released by the White House yesterday to feel anticlimactic. It was, after all, only a partial transcript of the phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky — and a White House utterly lacking in credibility had control over the document. Its release seemed to have the makings of a miniature version of William Barr’s  misleading summary  of the Mueller report. But the document turned out to be much more than that. If White House aides thought it would slow the momentum toward impeachment, they miscalculated. By day’s end, a majority of House members had come out in favor of impeachment, and Trump was conducting a desultory news conference, during which he behaved like the kind of “low energy” politician he often mocks. What struck me most about the document was just how much  Trumpism  it packed into only five pages, including: Failure to do the basics of the job.  Trump was evidently supposed to call Zelensky to talk about Ukraine’s recent parliamentary elections. Right from the start, however,    Trump was confused and focused on Zelensky’s original election, which occurred four months earlier. “The way you came from behind, somebody who wasn’t given much of a chance, and you ended up winning easily,” Trump says at the start of the call. Zelensky twice tried to steer Trump toward the correct subject. Self-absorption.  Whom else do you think Trump might have been thinking of when he described a surprising came-from-behind election victory? Personal enrichment.  Trump has made it  clear  that foreigners and Americans alike can curry favor with him by staying at one of his hotels, and Zelensky got the message: “Actually last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower,” he said. Lies and deception.  Trump offers an  outright falsehood  about Joe Biden during the call, saying that Biden “stopped” some (non-existent) prosecution, but he also offers a litany of misleading statements, including his reference to the  conspiracy theory  that Russia did not actually hack Democratic emails in 2016.     Strong-arm tactics.  In the call’s key moment, Trump says: “I would like you to do us a favor though.” He also says the following, about a former United States ambassador to Ukraine whom both he and Zelensky trash: “Well, she’s going to go through some things.”  Government officials as personal valets.  On the call, Trump roped Barr, the attorney general, into his effort to pressure Zelensky, undermining the Justice Department’s  post-Watergate history  as an agency that puts service to the law above service to the president.    Self over country.  That, of course, is the nub of the call and the reason it has sparked an impeachment inquiry. As  Max Boot  wrote in The Washington Post: “Trump is explicitly tying U.S. military aid to Ukraine to Ukraine’s willingness ‘to do us a favor.’ He then makes clear that the ‘us’ he is referring to is not the United States of America. It is the Trump campaign.”  For more David French ,  Jennifer Taub  and  Noah Bookbinder  make the case that the latest developments strengthen the case for impeachment. My colleague  Bret Stephens  argues that Democrats    have gone too far, too fast. And on  the latest episode of “The Argument” podcast , Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and I debate the wisdom of impeachment.

"Speaker Pelosi to hold meeting of full caucus to consider steps to advance impeachment; Mike Emanuel reports from Capitol Hill. Ahead of an expected announcement of an official impeachment inquiry,  House Speaker Nancy Pelois, D-Calif.,  revealed her emotional state ahead of the potentially massive move. Speaking at The Atlantic Festival on Tuesday, Pelosi said it is: ""sad to think that a president would perform an impeachable offense. It's hard. it's hard to say that we've gotten to that place but what would be [an] impeachable offense would be that which is proven in an investigation."" The Constitution grants the House of Representatives the power to investigate impeachable conduct while the Senate maintains authority for ultimately removing the president from office. Fox News has confirmed that Pelosi will announce the probe at 5 p.m. ET. During the event, which was held prior to the expected announcement, Pelosi indicated she would be backing official impeachment proceedings, arguing that she would need an official investigation to determine whether  the president  engaged in ""impeachable"" conduct. PELOSI FACING GROUNDSWELL OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT CALLS INSIDE CAUCUS OVER UKRAINE FUROR Tuesday's developments come after Pelosi repeatedly resisted calls for impeachment for much of 2019, after new evidence surfaced in the Russia investigation. However, her expected change of heart came after it was reported the president pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, tweeting that he would release the full unredacted transcript of their phone conversation.

"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com President Trump  remains scheduled to meet with his  Ukraine  counterpart at the  United Nations  General Assembly in New York next week despite a media frenzy unleashed by Friday's report that a whistleblower complained about a “promise” the U.S. president allegedly made to the foreign leader in a July phone call.  The U.N.'s  official schedule  says Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and 16 other world leaders will attend a General Assembly meeting Tuesday. NBC News White House correspondent Kelly O’Donnell tweeted Friday that the White House confirmed Trump will meet with Zelensky on Wednesday.  It wasn't immediately clear if the second gathering would be a one-on-one meeting. NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT Zelensky will also take meetings with leaders of the Ukrainian community in the U.S., leaders of Jewish organizations based in the U.S. and representatives of the American business community, O’Donnell reported. He will also attend the Sustainable Development Summit.  A senior White House official told Axios that Trump will meet with Zelensky to congratulate him on his victory in the eastern European nation’s recent presidential election and his “energy and success"" in battling corruption. The official said Trump will also voice ""his concerns about predatory Chinese economic activity in Ukraine."" Trump’s itinerary also says he’ll meet with the leaders of Pakistan, Poland, New Zealand, Singapore, Egypt, South Korea, the U.K., India, Iraq and El Salvador, Axios reported.  Trump will also host a summit Monday on religious freedom. His speech will present the U.S. as an alternative to authoritarianism and underline his ""commitment to upholding democracy and protecting religious freedom,"" administration officials said Friday during a briefing call, according to  Axios . Trump will not attend a U.N. meeting that same day that’s slated to focus on climate change.  A secret whistleblower filed a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, on Aug. 12, detailing a ""promise"" Trump reportedly made to an unnamed foreign leader. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire so far has withheld the complaint from Congress. The Washington Post and the New York Times both reported Thursday that  the complaint involved Ukraine. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Trump called the whistleblower a partisan and dismissed the allegation as “another political hack job,” while Democrats in Congress accused the president of trying to intimidate whistleblowers and demanded the administration hand over the complaint and a transcript of the call. 2020 hopefuls used the controversy as a chance to renew calls for impeachment. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has faced scrutiny for months over his past role allegedly pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to his son Hunter Biden. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation.

"Democrats are so determined to stop President Trump and refute the will of the American people that they are putting democracy at risk, says Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee. After all of the Democrats’ hype and political grandstanding surrounding the whistleblower complaint about President Trump’s phone call with the president of Ukraine, we are once again left with what we already knew: their calls for  impeachment  are baseless. The president  beat them at their own game by choosing to be completely transparent with the American people. In releasing the transcript of his phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump showed that he had nothing to hide. Contrary to hysterical media reports, there was no “quid pro quo.” There were no demands for an investigation or pressure whatsoever. And  Joe Biden  was barely given a mention over the course of 30 minutes. In fact, his name came up just once. GREGG JARRETT: TRUMP DID NOTHING WRONG – STILL, PELOSI AND HER COLLEAGUES WILL DO ANYTHING TO UNDO 2016  What really debunks the Democrats’ and the media’s narrative is what Trump legitimately asked for: help with the ongoing investigation by the attorney general into the corrupt origins of the Russia investigation and Ukraine’s involvement in it. Given the Democrats’ obsession with election meddling in 2016, their sudden lack of interest in getting to the bottom of what happened is hypocritical at best. They’ve made it clear that they were never interested in investigating the integrity of our democratic process. They are only interested in baseless investigations of the president. Two years later, nothing has changed.  As we expected, the Democrats’ baseless claims that Trump enlisted Ukraine in his reelection efforts were proven false. The president only mentioned Biden in passing during the phone call. Contrary to hysterical media reports, there was no “quid pro quo.” There were no demands for an investigation or pressure whatsoever.  Biden, on the other hand, was caught on tape bragging about threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless it ired the prosecutor tasked with investigating Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company that paid Hunter Biden $50,000 per month as a board member. Talk about “quid pro quo.” Trump merely noted on the matter in his phone call with Zelensky, “It sounds horrible to me.” CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER  The Department of Justice also found there was no merit to an alleged campaign finance violation during the call. This is unsurprising, given the initial complaint that kicked off the latest media anti-Trump spasm came from a whistleblower with “political bias” represented by a Democratic attorney.  Enlisting foreign nationals to do your dirty work is a page right out of the Democrats’ playbook. Just as the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton paid for disinformation on Trump from Russian sources, it was the Democrats who asked Ukraine for help to “sabotage Trump” in 2016.

"""It is time for this administration stop stonewalling and provide the Congress with all the facts it needs, including a copy of the formal  complaint made by the whistleblower . And it's time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this President,"" Biden said. The Democratic presidential candidate said if Trump ""does not comply with such a request from the Congress, if he continues to obstruct Congress, and flout the law, Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment.""  ""That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making,"" he said, speaking from Wilmington, Delaware.   Biden's comments on Tuesday were the most direct statement he has made on impeachment. But by making his call for Trump's removal conditional, he stopped short of some of his Democratic rivals, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who are calling for the House to impeach Trump now. ""I can take the political attacks,"" Biden said. ""They'll come and they'll go, and in time they'll soon be forgotten, but if we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution, that will last forever."" ""Denying Congress the information, which it is constitutionally entitled to, and obstructing its efforts to investigate actions is not the conduct of an American President,"" Biden said. ""It's an abuse of power.""  Biden said when he announced his candidacy he believed the ""core values of this nation, our very democracy, was at risk."" He said ""events in recent days have made that even clearer."" Trump is facing intense criticism over a July phone call during which, according to a person familiar with the matter,  he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden's son, Hunter . There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump on Sunday acknowledged the phone call and that he discussed Biden, but denied doing anything improper.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to announce a formal impeachment inquiry later Tuesday, multiple sources on Capitol Hill tell CNN. Trump  tweeted Tuesday  he has ""authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine."" CNN confirmed Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before a call with Zelensky, two senior administration officials said on Monday. The Washington Post first reported this. The call between Trump and Zelensky , which took place one day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was also part of a  whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General , the source added.  The Wall Street Journal  was first to report Trump pressured Zelensky during the July phone call.  Trump admitted Tuesday he delayed aid to Ukraine  ahead of the call to Zelensky, giving the excuse that he was waiting for European nations to contribute their fair share of aid. The Washington Post first reported  Monday Trump had directed his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million of US military and security aid to Ukraine in the days before he spoke with Zelensky. This story is breaking and will be updated. "
"White House to release Ukrainian phone call transcript, other documents; Ed Henry has the details. EXCLUSIVE:  A senior Trump administration official told Fox News late Tuesday that the administration will release a document showing the intelligence community inspector general found the whistleblower who leveled an  explosive accusation against President Trump  concerning his  talks with Ukraine  had indications of “political bias” in favor of “a rival candidate” of the president. The official did not identify the name of the rival candidate. Separately, a senior administration official told Fox News the White House has been working as quickly as it can to release to Congress the whistleblower complaint involving President Trump's conversations with the leader of Ukraine, as long as it's legally possible. Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson said in a Sep. 9 letter to the House Intelligence Committee that the whistleblower complaint ""appeared credible"" and related to an ""urgent"" matter. But the DNI general counsel said days later that, after consulting with the DOJ, the matter did not meet the legal definition of an “urgent concern,"" and was not subject to mandatory disclosure to Congress. News of the whistleblower's possible bias came just hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  initiated a formal impeachment  inquiry  by alleging that the administration was hiding the complaint. Other top Democrats  had previously said  such an inquiry was already underway. The senior administration official told Fox News that the White House had nothing to hide, that there has been no wrongdoing, and that the White House's general position has been that it will make everything possible available to Congress or the public regarding Trump's conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the complaint to the intelligence community's inspector general. A  source familiar with the matter told Fox News this week  that the whistleblower had no firsthand knowledge of Trump's July call with  Zelensky . Trump  vowed earlier Tuesday  to release a ""complete"" transcript of the call by Wednesday. A senior administration official told Fox News there are a “few words” in the transcript that will raise eyebrows, but it is nowhere near as inflammatory as Democrats have suggested. The contents of the call, as well as the whistleblower complaint, could throw cold water on Democrats' explosive suggestions that the president improperly threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine unless it investigated Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Republicans  had predicted over the weekend  that such an impeachment inquiry could backfire on Pelosi, and  administration officials have said  Trump was concerned only with broader corruption in Ukraine. Joe Biden  has acknowledged   on camera  that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm  Burisma Holdings  — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption. Just after midnight Wednesday, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani -- who has long publicly called for Ukraine to investigate Biden's dealings in Ukraine -- posted a series of messages on Twitter suggesting Democrats have a bigger problem on their hands. ""Democrat party is covering up a pattern of corruption involving high level members of the Obama cabinet,"" Giuliani wrote. ""The multi-million and billion dollar pay-for-play is mind boggling. Biden Family sale of office to Ukraine was not the only one or the most egregious. Slimy Joe is not alone."" Giuliani added: ""We know corrupt Ukrainian oligarch laundered $3 million to the Biden Family. But $3 to $4m more was laundered to Biden. So release all the financial records of all businesses involving Biden, Kerry’s stepson and notorious mobster Whitey Bulger’s nephew. ... Biden should agree to release records to see if he flew Hunter to China in Dec. 2013 on AF 2 to facilitate Hunter’s sale of his office to China for a total of $1.5 billion. Is there any doubt that China paid it to compromise VP. But they bought another pol as well. Guess?"" In her televised remarks, Pelosi specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by failing to turn over the whistleblower complaint. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal."" PELOSI ANNOUNCES IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY -- WILL IT BACKFIRE? Meanwhile, attention focused anew Tuesday night on previous apparent efforts by Democrats to pressure Ukraine on its investigations. The Washington Post's Marc Thiessen  pointed out  that CNN  reported  in May that Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez, Dick Durbin, and Patrick Leahy pushed Ukraine’s top prosecutor not to close four investigations perceived as critical to then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe -- and seemingly threatened that their support for U.S. aid to Ukraine was at stake. The senators wrote : ""In four short years, Ukraine has made significant progress in building [democratic] institutions despite ongoing military, economic, and political pressure from Moscow. We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump."" The senators called for the top prosecutor to “reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.” It remained unclear late Tuesday exactly what the president said on his call with Ukraine's leader. Fox News is was told the White House has taken steps to alleviate concerns about the precedential nature of releasing a transcript of the phone call with Zelensky. With the upcoming planned release of the transcript on Wednesday, the White House has put in place protections to preserve the confidential nature of conversations between the president and world leaders. Also in the evening, The New York Times  reported  that the White House had dropped its objection to the whistleblower speaking to Congress. That came after the GOP-controlled Senate passed a unanimous resolution seeking access to the whistleblower's complaint.

       Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday, and is expected to face a series of questions about these and other issues. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said earlier Tuesday afternoon that testimony from the whistleblower might also be imminent. ""We have been informed by the whistleblower’s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI [Director of National Intelligence] as to how to do so,"" Schiff said in a tweet. ""We‘re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week."" FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED Despite the apparent progress in releasing the relevant information,  Pelosi,  D-Calif., told the nation that ""the president must be held accountable"" for his ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections."" ""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella. ""The president must be held accountable,"" she continued. ""No one is above the law."" The House committees then would gather evidence and present it to Pelosi and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who would make the ultimate determination on whether to hold an impeachment vote. A Democratic source told Fox News that the House Intelligence Committee, led by Schiff, would take the lead in the impeachment investigation -- and that Nadler might not be pleased with the arrangement. ""I don’t think he’s happy that he has less influence here, but everybody is on the same page and has the same role,"" the source said of Nadler. Schiff ""will have a heavy role here because the foundation of the Ukraine allegations is thorough his committee,"" the source said. The speaker effectively endorsed the process, which to some degree has  already been underway , after facing fresh pressure from inside the caucus to act. The move could help Democrats' disputed  arguments in court  that impeachment proceedings were in fact in progress, which could entitle Congress to obtain additional documents. WATCH BIDEN RECOUNT HOW HE PUSHED FOR SHOKIN'S FIRING At the same time, at an  event Tuesday , Pelosi intimated that impeachment would remain on the table, regardless of what the transcript showed. Many conservatives charged that she was  moving the goalposts  and lowering expectations. ""We have many other, shall we say, candidates for impeachable offenses in terms of the Constitution, but this one is the most understandable by the public,"" Pelosi said, referring to the Ukraine phone call allegation. ""It's really important to know this: There is no requirement that there be a quid-pro-quo in the conversation.""

       Other prominent Democrats also seemingly said Trump should be impeached no matter what. ""The president has committed several impeachable offenses,"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told reporters after Pelosi's remarks on impeachment. In another indication that Democrats were apparently hedging their bets on the Ukraine matter, Ocasio-Cortez said alleged Emoluments Clause violations by the president could be included in prospective articles of impeachment. Republicans said the move would prove to be a major political mistake. ""It is a colossal error,"" Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn told Fox News just prior to Pelosi's comments. ""And, I’m kind of surprised that Speaker Pelosi, as shrewd as she is, would let it get to this point."" FLURRY OF SWING-STATE DEMS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AS AOC CALLS LACK OF ACTION A 'NATIONAL SCANDAL' Swing district Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., acknowledged to Fox News that supporting the impeachment inquiry ""could"" affect her electorally, but she maintained that Trump voters in her district ""understand,"" and that Trump crossed a red line. Trump, for his part, ripped into Democrats in a series of  tweets  immediately after Pelosi's comments, writing that ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT"" was in progress again. In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But, he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine  a ""disgrace,""  acknowledged that Biden had come up during the call and added: ""It's very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?"" ""It is a colossal error."" House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, called Democrats' efforts predictable and destructive in his own fiery statement. ""Democrats have been trying to impeach the President since the beginning of this Congress,"" Jordan said. ""Michael Cohen's testimony was a bust. John Dean's testimony was a waste of time. The Mueller report did not live up to the hype. ""Speaker Pelosi's decision to pursue impeachment now - on the basis of unsubstantiated, indirect, and anonymous allegations - only shows that the Speaker has finally succumbed to unrelenting pressure from the socialist wing of the Democrat Party,"" Jordan added. ""This was never about Russian collusion or Ukrainian prosecutions. It is all about undoing the 2016 election and the will of the American people."" Trump is set to meet with Zelensky in New York on Wednesday. The visit was previously scheduled, unrelated to the whistleblower allegation, although the two leaders are expected to face questions about the matter from reporters. A total of 172 House Democrats have now signaled strong support for an impeachment inquiry -- 235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with  one pro-impeachment independent . A majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. A highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Vice President Mike Pence would then take office in that scenario. ""The ironic thing is is that everything that our critics in the media are leveling at the president from this phone call, and leveling at our administration, everything that Democrats on Capitol Hill are running off and describing -- Vice President Joe Biden bragged about -- which was a quid-pro-quo -- withholding American aid in exchange for a specific action,"" Pence  told Fox News' ""Hannity""  on Monday. Fox News' Chad Pergram, Brooke Singman, Ronn Blitzer and Jake Gibson contributed to this report."
"President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani on his conversation with Ukraine officials. Rudy Giuliani  channeled  President Trump  Monday with a wee-hours Twitter blitz aimed at turning the Ukraine story currently roiling Washington into a big problem for Democrats. Giuliani, the personal attorney for Trump and outspoken critic of presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son’s relationship with Ukraine, accused Kiev of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden, suggested that the Obama administration turned a blind eye, and made the prediction that the scandal is in its infancy. ROMNEY WANTS ANSWERS IN WHISTLEBLOWER STORY ""If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,” he tweeted. ""Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?"" Giuliani titled his first tweet, ""NEW FACT,"" and said Hunter Biden received a one-time payment of $3 million from the Ukraine that went through Latvia and then to Cyprus, before entering the U.S.  BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN LIKELY COMING TO AN END, NUNES SAYS Giuliani did not provide how he learned about the purported transaction but said prosecutors were stonewalled at the time when they inquired about the sum. ""Did Obama know that his VP, the one he put in charge of giving billions to Ukraine, had a son who was making millions on the board of one of the most corrupt companies in Ukraine,"" he tweeted. ""[Hunter] Biden’s boss had stolen $5b from Ukraine and was a fugitive. Did Obama know? Did he approve?"" The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump asked his Ukranian counterpart to investigate Hunter Biden, who had a key role in a natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, that was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor as part of a corruption probe. Hunter Biden has not been accused of wrongdoing during his time at the company, where he made $50,000 a month as a member of the board of directors,  according to  The New York Times. Up until his role on the board, Hunter Biden had no experience in Ukraine, the Times reported. At a conference two years after he left office, Joe Biden  openly boasted  about successfully pressuring Ukraine to  fire that prosecutor  when he was vice president. Trump on Sunday appeared to confirm that he spoke about Joe Biden with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but insisted that the call was routine. Democrats seized on his admission and some renewed calls for his impeachment. Political observers raised questions as to why Trump would allow himself to get into a position that it could even appear like he is seeking help from a foreign power to achieve political ends.  Giuliani, like many Trump supporters, stressed that the story is not the phone calls, rather the crony capitalism on display where the son of a sitting vice president could make millions working on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Trump accused Joe Biden of dishonesty in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling  The New Yorker  magazine that they spoke “just once” about it.

"Is that more in line with America's values? Fox News contributor Jonathan Morris weighs in. ""The View""  co-host Abby Huntsman took her colleague  Joy Behar  to task Tuesday after the latter tried guilt-tripping people into supporting action on  climate change. Behar started the debate by claiming that people who denied climate change didn't care about their grandchildren. ""Some of these people who are denying climate change — they're going to be dead and they don't care apparently about their grandchildren. They only care about their 401k's,"" Behar argued. For Huntsman, Behar's statement went too far. She argued that it wasn't ""fair to say that they don't care about their own grandkids."" ""That's what it looks like to me,"" Behar shot back. She later indicated she would continue ""guilt-tripping"" people over the issue.

"President Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following White House release of unredacted transcript of Ukraine call. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire  denied a report by The Washington Post Wednesday that he had threatened to resign amid the clamor over  President Trump’s July phone call  with the Ukrainian president. “At no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on Aug. 16, 2019,” Maguire said in a statement. “I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now. I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation.” The Post report, which cited ""current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter,"" said that Maguire had threatened to turn in his resignation over concerns that the White House might try to make him stonewall Congress. He is set to testify Thursday about  a whistleblower complaint  that has spurred House Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry into Trump. READ THE FULL TRANSCRIPT HERE The White House has also denied that Maguire threatened to resign, with Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham complaining on Twitter that the Post had only given them six minutes to respond to their request for comment. “This is actually not true,” Grisham said of the newspaper’s story. “And we would have gone on the record to say that if the @washingtonpost had given us more than 6 minutes (literally) to respond.” The account of Maguire’s resignation threat is another subplot in the furor enveloping Washington in the aftermath of revelations concerning the unnamed whistleblower’s complaint. UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER, BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID Earlier Wednesday, the White House released a transcript of Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing Trump broached a review of dealings in the Eastern European country involving former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Joe Biden has stated that while vice president, he urged Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. Shokin had been investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention. The transcript, though, did not show Trump explicitly linking the request to $400 million in American aid to Ukraine, which at the time was on hold.

"""As soon as I saw that he had recommended it be sent to Congress, that's all I needed to know it was legit,"" said Mary McCord, the senior litigator from Practice at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection who worked with Atkinson at the US Attorney's Office and DOJ's National Security Division.   Several officials who acknowledged they are skeptical of the complaint told CNN the IC IG, Michael Atkinson, is a serious professional and that his recommendation gives them pause when they would have been inclined to dismiss the case otherwise.  Atkinson is widely regarded as a career non-partisan with little interest in the public limelight but he currently finds himself at the center of the  high profile controversy related to whether the whistleblower complaint . His recommendation that the complaint, which Atkinson says raised allegations of ""urgent concern,"" be shared with lawmakers has fueled the escalating standoff between the director of national intelligence and Congress while Trump has continued to publicly question the whistleblower's motives for speaking out.  But Atkinson has stood by his conclusion that the complaint indeed raises concerns that must be handed over to Congress in accordance with the law, despite clashing with his own boss, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, over that determination.  The House Intelligence Committee  released a letter  from Atkinson last week in which he wrote that he and Maguire, ""are at an impasse"" over that point, marking an unprecedented disagreement between the DNI and IC IG.  ""This involves something more sinister, something involving a serious or flagrant abuse or violation of law or misappropriation, and the IG underscored the seriousness of this, and also that this needs to be looked into. And right now, no one is looking into this,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Friday. Appointed as IC IG by Trump in 2018, Atkinson's long-standing reputation as a straight-shooter with professional integrity has bolstered the legitimacy of the whistleblower complaint despite the President's attempts to paint it as a partisan attack, multiple sources have told CNN.  Credible sense of urgency  Prior to his Senate confirmation to become IC IG in 2018, Atkinson worked for the Justice Department for over 15 years, according  to his biography on the ODNI website .  From 2002 through 2006, Atkinson worked as a trial attorney in DOJ's Criminal Division, Fraud Section. He then served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from 2006 through 2016, where he was the acting chief and deputy chief of the Fraud and Public Corruption Section.   Some of Atkinson's former colleagues agreed that his credentials as a non-partisan and relative obscurity prior to becoming involved in the whistleblower case lend weight to the seriousness of the complaint. Atkinson brought several major cases to the US Attorney's Office that were ""the result of thorough, quiet investigation,"" according to McCord, who served as the acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security at DOJ from 2016 to 2017 and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division from 2014 to 2016.  That quiet, non-partisan approach to his work is why McCord believed he would be a good fit for the IC IG role. ""The mere fact he was not on anyone's radar is points to the fact that his sense of urgency is credible,"" she said. ""People don't know who he is and that's because he does his job. He's the IG and most of that work is not in the public sphere."" ""You would not know which political party he favors by working with him. I worked with him for years. That's the other reason I feel he's so credible in this space,"" McCord added.   Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's National Security Division, John Carlin, told CNN that Atkinson is ""someone who is very deliberate, thoughtful and tries to carefully review facts ... not someone who seeks attention.""  ""So if he is in a situation where something needed to be referred that's because it was his best and informed view of what the law required,"" he said.  Not backing down? McCord told CNN that she believes Atkinson feels strongly that the complaint needs to be reported to Congress but is also trying to respect the hierarchy in place, which includes the DNI.  During a closed-door briefing with Schiff's committee on Thursday, Atkinson would only discuss the process for his handling of the whistleblower's concerns, the chairman said. Though lawmakers pressed him for details on the complaint, their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. The inspector general does not have the authority to discuss the details of the complaint with Congress because the DNI has not shared the actual report with the committee and had apparently not otherwise authorized Atkinson to share those details. Although the official details of the complaint have not been provided to members of Congress, Atkinson told the panel during the briefing that it raised concerns about multiple actions but would not say if those instances involved Trump, according to sources familiar with the briefing. According to one source, Atkinson referenced ""a sequence of events"" and ""alleged actions"" that took place. However, another source disputed that the IG provided substantive details regarding the whistleblower claim.  The whistleblower's complaint deals at least in part with a July call between Trump and Ukraine's president. CNN has previously reported that Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. Trump has admitted to discussing Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper.  There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. While Trump and some Congressional Republicans have attempted to downplay concerns surrounding the complaint, McCord told CNN that she does not see Atkinson backing down from his position.  ""If he got to a position where he saw resigning as the only alternative, he would do it ... but there is a lot of space between now and that point,"" McCord added, noting that Maguire is still expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.

"Rudy Giuliani is the Trump administration’s point man on Ukraine. Just remember that, and everything else will make a lot more sense. “I think it’s incredible the way he’s done,” the president of the United States said Wednesday about his personal lawyer, who specializes in going on television and babbling incoherently. We don’t know precisely what Giuliani’s diplomatic role is, given the fact that he’s not a government employee. His job seems mainly to be finding some proof that when Joe Biden was vice president, he was up to some shady Ukraine business in order to help out his son, Hunter. Rudy certainly has  Donald Trump’s  ear — and more clout than the beleaguered State Department. “Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man,” Trump told the president of Ukraine. “He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you.” As mayor, Giuliani’s was most famous for his 9/11 performance, which was more impressive if you ignored the fact that he’d located the city’s emergency command at the World Trade Center, despite police warnings that the towers had previously been bombed by terrorists. In a way, he’s playing a similar role now — he’s assigned to deal with a crisis he’s helped create. How often did you worry about Ukraine before Rudy picked up the case? Among other accomplishments, our person-without-portfolio managed to get rid of the respected U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Giuliani  seems to believe  she was in collusion with liberal megadonor George Soros in a plot to destroy Paul Manafort. Or something. Very hard to get inside the Rudy mind. It’s a dark and winding territory. Remember  that fabled appearance  on CNN with Chris Cuomo? “So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?” “Of course I did!” “You just said you didn’t!” “No, I didn’t ask them to look into Joe Biden.” People, if you had a pal who needed only two or three minutes of airtime to contradict himself, a pal who was deeply unphotogenic to the point of scary, a pal who had no formal relationship whatsoever to the federal government, would you encourage him to speak about foreign affairs on your behalf? A lot? See, this is why Trump is president and you’re not. The saga Giuliani’s peddling is that when Joe Biden was vice president, he got a top Ukraine prosecutor tossed out of office for investigating Hunter Biden’s business deals in that country. Actually, most of the Western world had loathed said prosecutor for his corruption. But Trump definitely likes Rudy’s story better. Especially the part about Biden’s kid making large chunks of money from jobs he would never have gotten if his father had been, say, a high school principal in Ohio. We will pause here to recall that Eric and Donald Trump Jr. make their living by running around  collecting millions in hotel business  from Republican supporters. Rudy Giuliani’s son is serving as a public liaison assistant to President Trump. Moving forward. During his unending march through TV interviews, Giuliani declared that Trump never threatened to withhold Ukrainian aid unless he was given the goods on Joe Biden. Then added that he couldn’t really “tell you if it’s 100 percent.” The president’s main confidant appeared to be saying there’s a chance — 10 percent? 30? 97? — that Trump actually did inform the head of a foreign government he wasn’t going to get the military funding Congress had authorized unless he came up with some dirt on a potential presidential opponent. Wow. Rudy and Donald have a lot in common. They’ve both been married three times. Giuliani is now being sued for divorce by his latest spouse, who said he had turned into a “different man.” A presumably less reliable version than the one who, as mayor, held a press conference to announce he was breaking up with his then-wife without ever notifying the person in question. Anyhow, current wife Judith Giuliani claimed that he had taken up with another woman, and that  she could testify to his failings  as “a spouse and a nurse.” Some Rudy-watchers wondered if that was a reference to his drinking. All we know for sure is that this is a guy who must make Donald Trump feel as if he’s had an exceptionally righteous personal life. There’s a lot Trump likes about his pal. Undoubtedly including the way he’ll yell “ Shut up, moron! ” at a fellow panelist — even on Fox News. Trump  forcefully defended  Giuliani Wednesday when he was meeting with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, a seemingly cheerful 41-year-old former TV star who very reasonably said he didn’t “want to be involved” in American politics. The two presidents seemed to get along very well. This was possibly because Zelensky has learned the importance at flattering Trump at every turn. Or maybe it’s their joint show business background. Zelensky starred in a TV series about an idealistic teacher who winds up becoming — yes! — Ukraine president. Our experiment with entertainers hasn’t been quite as successful. If only we’d elected, say, Homer Simpson instead. The First Pal would have been an underemployed barfly, and the whole world would be much happier.

"Trump addresses reporters as he arrives at the United Nations, says 'what Biden did was wrong.' Former Massachusetts Gov.  Bill Weld , who is challenging  President Trump  in the Republican primaries, proclaimed Monday that the president committed treason through his  controversial phone call  to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- adding that the punishment for treason is death. The statement drew a swift rebuke from the Trump campaign. “The media’s affliction with Trump Derangement Syndrome has driven them into an actual discussion of the proposed execution of the President of the United States,” communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News. “In severe cases of TDS such as this, immediate consultation with a physician is recommended.” LONG-SHOT GOP PRIMARY CHALLENGERS TO HAVE THEIR OWN DEBATE THIS MONTH -- MINUS TRUMP Weld was responding to claims that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden -- the son of former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden -- and threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine as leverage. Trump  has denied  wrongdoing. “Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election, it couldn’t be clearer. And that’s not just undermining democratic institutions, that is treason,"" Weld said on  MSNBC 's ""Morning Joe."" ""It’s treason pure and simple. And the penalty for treason under the U.S. Code is death. That’s the only penalty.” Weld then referred to impeachment as a possible alternative to a criminal case, stating, “The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office, and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal.” Weld’s mention of the death penalty later ignited a conversation about the “legal framework” of the claim. Weld again said, “The only penalty for treason is death, it’s spelled out in the statute.” While the U.S. Code does list the death penalty as a punishment for treason, Weld’s claim that it is the only penalty is false. Treason is covered by  18. U.S. Code § 2381 , which says that a person guilty of treason “shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.” When Fox News asked Weld’s campaign about this, they did not immediately respond. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Weld's comments came during a joint television appearance with the two other longshot Republicans challenging Trump in next year's primary: former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh. They have joined together to protest the canceling of GOP presidential primaries in some states in 2020."
"Fox Nation host  Tomi Lahren  blasted the latest controversial proposal from 2020  Democratic  presidential candidate Bernie  Sanders , I-Vt., to spend a whopping $2.5 trillion to guarantee housing for every American. “Guaranteed housing, add that to the list of socialist agenda items that sound good to some, but in reality, are just big government solutions that move our nation away from freedom and closer to  socialism ,” said Lahren on  Fox Nation’s  “Final Thoughts.” TRUMP SAYS CALIFORNIA CITIES 'DESTROY THEMSELVES' WITH HOMELESSNESS On Wednesday, Sanders unveiled his “Housing for All” plan. The progressive senator said there’s a shortage of 7.4 million affordable homes for the lowest-income renters. And he stressed that more than 18 million families across the country are paying more than half of their limited incomes on housing and utilities. A spokesman for President Trump's reelection  campaign  called it ""yet another pie-in-the-sky, big government socialist promise by the Bernie camp."" Lahren panned the plan as “another giant, expensive federal program” and blasted Sanders’ plan to pay for it all. “How does he plan to pay for it? The way all these Democrats plan to pay for their radical proposals, taxation.  Bernie claims a wealth tax on the top 1/10 of 1 percent of Americans will fund his initiative.” She continued, “Well, folks, he and others in his party already plan to dump the burden of Medicare-for-all, free college, medical debt cancellation, and the Green New Deal on the backs of the wealthy. Do they really think the top 1 percent can afford to fund the entire nation? Total income confiscation wouldn’t pay for all those programs!” Lahren argued that increasing taxes on the wealthy encourages them to move, leaving the middle class to foot the bill. “Here’s the thing about wealth, Bernie, it’s MOBILE. Meaning the wealthiest Americans are not going to sit idly by as their incomes are confiscated to fund your big government pie-in-the-sky plans,” Lahren said. She continued, “Then what? What happens when the richest Americans take their money elsewhere? Who pays for these quasi-socialist plans? Answer, we do. The middle class, the average American.” The concern that the wealthy may move to avoid paying taxes is not a hypothetical, according to Lahren. She said that is exactly what has happened in her state. “That’s why the middle class has been driven out of places like California, for cryin’ out loud. It’s only affordable for the exorbitantly wealthy and the homeless!” LAHREN ON AMERICAN UNITY AFTER 9/11: 'WE HAVE JUST LOST IT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY' Finally, Lahren said that Sanders’ proposal would not decrease homelessness. “I live in California, the state that is comprised of 47 percent of all unsheltered people in the nation. Yet what do we do here in California? We add more taxes, more regulations, more control on top of already cash-strapped residents and families. Here’s what else I know, throwing more government and more taxpayer dollars at the problem does not solve the problem. If it did we wouldn’t be in this predicament right here in California.” Lahren concluded, “When will these socialist wannabes figure it out?  Throwing taxpayer dollars, big government and entitlement at the problem does not solve the problem. It just moves our nation one dangerous step closer to socialism. Maybe that’s what people like Bernie want but it’s up to us to stand in his way.” To see Lahren's full remarks and for more episodes of Tomi Lahren's daily commentary offering a refreshing and unfiltered perspective on issues across the country, join  Fox Nation  and watch  ""First & Final Thoughts""   today.

"5. The race to make the next debate:  The October 1 deadline to qualify for the fourth Democratic debate -- set for October 15 and sponsored by CNN and The New York Times -- is rapidly approaching, and with it the last chance, seemingly, for any lower-tier candidates to make the case that they shouldn't be counted out just yet. (Missing one debate is bad enough. Missing two is a political death sentence.) At the moment, the field is at 11, with wealthy businessman Tom Steyer making the October debate after narrowly missing the September set-to. The only other candidate who appears to be on the cusp of qualification is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who, with the  CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll  released over the weekend, now has three of the four polls that she needs showing her at 2% or higher. (Gabbard has already met the fundraising threshold with 130,000 unique donors.) Spiritual guru Marianne Williamson has met the fundraising qualification but has only a single poll that shows her at 2%. (She didn't even rate 1% in  the CNN-DMR poll .) The largest the debate field will grow then, realistically, is 12. Which means that eight candidates currently running won't be on the debate stage for the second straight month. Which should tell them all something. 4. Can Kamala come back?:  Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,""  said her campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez. So, will it work? Harris has her work cut out for her, according to the  new CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll.  She's at 6%, good for 5th place, at the moment but that is largely stagnant from where she's been in the state since December 2018. (She was at 5% then.) Harris is generally well-liked in the state -- 63% favorable/24% unfavorable -- but her unfavorables have tripled since March and her favorables have only bumped up marginally (58% in March). And those who feel strongly favorable toward Harris (26%) -- usually a good measure of energy behind a candidate -- runs behind her main rivals like Elizabeth Warren (44%), Pete Buttigieg (33%), Joe Biden (29%) and Bernie Sanders (26%). Harris does have time, as there are  still  134 days before the February 3, 2020 caucuses. But she has been stuck in the same place in Iowa for months. Which means she needs a jump-start. And soon. 3. Booker over and out?:  Cory Booker may be the next high-profile candidate out of the 2020 race, according to a memo from his campaign manager first reported by NBC. The memo suggested that unless the New Jersey senator can raise $1.7 million in the next 10 days, he will run out of money and be forced from the race. The campaign insisted the move was not a fundraising ploy, but it worked either way! As of Sunday morning, Booker had raised just over $300,000 in the first 24 hours of the fundraising push. Of course, $300K -- while good! -- is not $1.7 million. And you can't just keep warning that you are going to drop out of the race unless people give you more money for the remainder of the contest. The sky can only be falling once (or maybe twice!) ""I don't believe people should stay in this just to stay in it,"" Booker said in Iowa on Saturday. ""You either have a trajectory to win or not. And right now, we don't raise $1.7 million, we won't be able to make the investments necessary."" Booker may get his $1.7 million this time. But without significant poll improvements, it's hard to see how he can keep raising the money he is going to need to compete with the big girls and boys. He will, for sure, stay in the race until the next debate -- October 15 in Ohio and sponsored by CNN. But is there a path beyond that? 2. Elizabeth Warren, Iowa front-runner:  Warren has been the hottest candidate in the 2020 race for the past few months now. And it's showing up not just in national polling but now also in the crucial state of Iowa. The  Des Moines Register/CNN/MediaCom Iowa poll  released Saturday night showed Warren at 22% and at the top of the pack although followed closely by Joe Biden at 20%. No one else in the field was terribly close to the top two, with Bernie Sanders at 11% in third place and Pete Buttigieg in fourth with 9%. While the topline numbers are good for Warren, the trend lines are even better. She gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now. Warren's favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is beyond her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders. Couple all of those data points with the fact that Warren has, by far, the best ground organization in Iowa, and you have to make her the favorite in the Hawkeye State today. 1. Trump vs. Biden vs. Ukraine:  It's only September, but we're already getting a look at what a general election fight between Trump and Biden would look like. Faced with a whistleblower complaint from the intelligence community about a series of interactions between himself and the Ukrainians, Trump is trying to push the attention to Biden and his son, Hunter, vis a vis Ukraine. Fact checkers have  already debunked Trump's claims  about there being something nefarious in Biden's trip to the Ukraine in 2016 and his son's work for a natural gas company in the country, and there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either. Biden has pushed back aggressively. ""Every single outlet that's looked at this said there's nothing there there,""  he told the Iowa Starting Line . ""And me, nor anyone in my family did anything inappropriate. And every major outlet has acknowledged that. I just find it very Trump-like."" It is very ""Trump-like!"" Because, facts be damned, Trump has and will continue to use his media megaphone -- press gaggles + Twitter -- to push the idea that something was going on in Ukraine with the two Bidens. And if past is prologue, he won't stop -- no matter what fact-checkers or his advisers tell him. On the one hand, this fight is good for Biden. Electability is his strongest argument to Democratic voters -- and the more Trump hits Biden, the more the former vice president can seek to bypass the primary and begin running the general election. On the other, it's reminder that whether Biden or some other Democrat is the nominee, we can expect Trump to say and do literally anything in pursuit of a second term."
"Democratic Caucus to meet on response to whistleblower complaint; Garrett Tenney reports from Washington. The rapidly escalating controversy over President Trump’s alleged efforts to pressure  Ukraine  to investigate the Bidens has, in turn, quickly increased pressure on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from within her Democratic caucus to take a definitive stance on impeachment proceedings. While House Judiciary Committee Democrats already have launched what they describe as  impeachmen t proceedings, Pelosi, D-Calif., until now has taken a cautious approach. TRUMP ADMIN CLAIMS UKRAINE AID WAS STALLED OVER CORRUPTION CONCERNS, DECRIES MEDIA 'FRENZY' But in the wake of reports that the White House froze millions in aid to Ukraine shortly before Trump allegedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, numerous congressional Democrats have publicly backed an impeachment inquiry. This includes some centrist members and senior Democratic lawmakers who had earlier shied away from such calls. The disagreements are likely to come to a head at a caucus meeting late Tuesday afternoon, where Fox News is told she'll announce a formal impeachment inquiry. “She’s all but out of options,” a Democratic source told Fox News ahead of the meeting. Speaking at a Washington forum with Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg, Pelosi confirmed she’d be making an announcement at 5 p.m. ET, without going into specifics. However, she seemed to set the table for an impeachment-related statement, accusing the director of national intelligence of “breaking the law” at the administration’s direction by not releasing a related whistleblower complaint. As for concerns about the political implications of moving on impeachment, Pelosi said: “This is about patriotism.” “The president is making lawlessness a virtue in this country,” Pelosi said. She even argued that it won’t be necessary to prove Trump delivered a “quid pro quo” – a comment that came as Trump announced, via Twitter, that he’ll be releasing a transcript of the phone call in question. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has already launched what he's described as impeachment proceedings, including a hearing last week featuring former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. But the Democratic source suggested Democrats are frustrated with Nadler’s approach, and looking for more action. “He’s not been able to deliver accountability surrounding the litany of crimes committed by the Trump syndicate,” the source told Fox News. A senior House Democratic source told Fox News there even has been discussion of a select committee to conduct an impeachment inquiry against Trump -- a move that would take it out of Nadler's hands. But the situation is fluid and other sources say they are waiting to hear from Pelosi during the caucus meeting. By Tuesday, even senior members of the caucus were joining the impeachment chorus. In an emotional speech on the House floor, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., called for an impeachment investigation, saying he ""has waited.” “Sometimes I’m afraid to go to sleep for fear that I will wake up and our democracy will be gone, will be gone, and never return,” he said. “This administration demonstrates complete disregard and disdain for ethics, for the law and for the constitution. They have lied under oath, they have refused to account for their action and appear before (a) legislative body, who have the constitutional right to inquire about their activities.” He added: “We cannot delay. We must not wait. Now is the time to act.” “The future of our democracy is at stake. There comes a time when you have to be moved by the spirit of history to take action to protect, preserve the integrity of our nation,” he continued. “I believe, I surely believe the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come. To delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy.” The new impeachment wave began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week that involved allegations that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky. A person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have “firsthand knowledge” of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, but Democrats want to see the complaint. The discussions apparently involved efforts to pressure Ukraine to look into a separate controversy involving the Biden family. Joe Biden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump and his allies have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate's role. At issue now is whether Trump sought to withhold military aid as leverage in seeking an inquiry. Multiple administration sources confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that the Office of Management and Budget told the State Department and Department of Defense in July that it was putting a hold on nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. But administration sources said this was tied to concerns about corruption and other issues. Trump, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, insisted he sought to hold up the Ukraine aid because he “wanted other countries to pay.” “There was no quid pro quo,” he said. “There was no pressure applied, nothing.” FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AMID BOMBSHELL REPORTS TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE AID But amid the reports about the frozen Ukraine aid money, late Monday night a slew of key swing-district Democrats publicly offered their support for opening a formal impeachment inquiry. Seven centrist Democratic freshmen lawmakers who served in the military and national security announced in an op-ed in The Washington Post that if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens for political benefit, it’s impeachable. The lawmakers included Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. The Democrats wrote in The Washington Post they ""do not arrive at this conclusion lightly."" Also, later Monday night, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz and Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell endorsed an impeachment inquiry. Such an inquiry would not be an impeachment vote, but rather an investigative process that could lead to actual impeachment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There are now 164 House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with  one independent  -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. An unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president.) Fox News' Mike Emanuel, Chad Pergram, Gregg Re and John Roberts contributed to this report. "
"Democrats are going through 'Russia Fantasy Part II,' says John Sununu, former White House chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush. Former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu said on Monday that the  Ukraine  phone call scandal involving  President Trump  is just a repeat of how the Democrats' Russian collusion narrative unfolded. “It’s just a repeat, it’s a rerun, it’s a sequel to what they did with Russia,” Sununu told  “America’s Newsroom.” Trump was accused of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy into investigating  Joe Biden  and his son, Hunter, for their ties to a natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, which was being investigated as part of a corruption case. This prompted Democratic lawmakers to call for the release of the entire transcript of the phone call in question. UKRAINE PHONE CALL SCANDAL IS MEDIA STRIKING BACK AFTER FAILED RUSSIA HOAX, SAYS DAN BONGINO “[Democratic California House Rep. Adam] Schiff goes out, makes an outrageous statement, as he did with the Russia claims, and the Mueller report just made it clear that all those claims that came out of Schiff were pure unadulterated lies,” said Sununu, who served as White House chief of staff under President George H. W. Bush. SARAH SANDERS: MEDIA 'HAS EGG ON THEIR FACE' FROM FAILING TO MAKE RUSSIA COLLUSION NARRATIVE STICK Sununu said that the Trump administration should release the entire transcript as he is aware that it would draw concern. “If I were the White House, I would try and release as much as the transcript of the conversation as possible,” he said. He said that if the transcript were to be disclosed, foreign leaders will not speak frankly with the president in fear that the intelligence community in the U.S. can't keep secrets.

"As summer turns to fall, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden have separated themselves from the pack. The  gold standard poll in Iowa  showed Warren with 22% support and Biden with 20% of likely Democratic caucus-goers.  The new reality left more than a dozen other Democrats scrambling to keep the primary from turning into a two-person race -- with New Jersey Sen.  Cory Booker offering an extraordinary admission  that he might have no path forward.   Their weekend of retail politicking took place amid a national firestorm over reports that  President Donald Trump had pressed the Ukrainian president  to investigate the business dealings of Biden's son, Hunter Biden, in the country.  There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Warren arrived in Iowa newly at war with Democratic leaders in Congress. She declared -- first in a fundraising email, then in her speech in front of 12,000 Democrats at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday -- that "" Congress is complicit "" in Trump's actions because the Democratic-led House has failed to begin impeachment proceedings.  ""What the President has now demonstrated is that he thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors,"" Warren told reporters in Cedar Rapids. ""He can go back to the well on exactly what he did before. And that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election. It's time for Congress to step up and begin serious impeachment proceedings against this man.""  Biden, meanwhile, was at times testy with reporters over the news. It's the sort of clash that Biden has relished -- one that gave him the opportunity to go toe-to-toe with Trump as if the general election had already arrived.  But Biden was also insistent that the  focus should remain on Trump  improperly inviting foreign interference in a US election -- not on Biden and his son. ""Trump did a terrible thing,"" he said Sunday in Kansas City, Kansas -- his first stop after two days in Iowa. ""Focus on the violation of the Constitution this President has engaged in.""  But as he campaigned in Iowa -- a climate change speech and an LGBTQ forum in Cedar Rapids on Friday, then a Steak Fry appearance Saturday -- there were signs of trouble, including a poll that showed Warren as the second choice of 20% of Democrats surveyed to Biden's 10% -- a potentially important factor given Iowa's unique caucus rules that will force those backing candidates with less than 15% support to move on to their second choices.  He also faced criticism over his response to the moderator at the LGBTQ forum.  Lyz Lenz, an Iowa-based journalist and author, had asked Biden a pointed question about his voting record and his reference to Vice President Mike Pence as a ""decent guy.""  Biden paused and responded: ""You're a lovely person."" Then, on the way off the stage, Lenz tweeted, Biden ""said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart.' ""   ""It's 2019 -- we shouldn't be calling professional women sweethearts,"" Lenz told CNN backstage.  In Iowa, Warren and Biden appear to be the dominant forces a little more than four months from the Democratic caucuses. But there remains room for movement.  The poll found that just 20% of likely caucus-goers have a first-choice candidate and say they are unlikely to be persuaded to support someone else.  That reality was underscored at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday: While many of the 12,000 tickets organizers said they sold to the event were purchased by campaigns that brought their own supporters in, many attendees who had purchased their own tickets or gotten them from their local Democratic parties said in interviews that they were still considering multiple candidates.  Harper Folsom, a 23-year-old student from Manchester, Iowa, said her top two candidates are Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro -- but she also likes Biden, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Booker.  ""I think it's important to have the most diverse amount of voices that we can,"" she said.  Still, many of the Steak Fry attendees said they are ready for the field to winnow -- and the CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll found evidence of who voters have already broadly dropped from the lists of candidates they are considering.   Only eight candidates are even viewed favorably by a clear majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers: Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have by far the highest net favorability rating, followed by California Sen. Kamala Harris, Booker, Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, O'Rourke and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.  Entrepreneur Andrew Yang is viewed favorably by just four percentage points more of those polled than see him unfavorably. And the rest of the field -- including Castro, billionaire investor Tom Steyer and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, all of whom might qualify for the party's October presidential debate -- is viewed unfavorably by a majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers. Some candidates seeking a way out of the low single digits are turning to desperate measures.  Booker campaign manager Addisu Demissie started Saturday morning with a memo featuring  an unusual and startling admission : If Booker couldn't raise $1.7 million by the end of the month, he'd have no path forward and would need to exit the race.  The tactic appeared to work, at least initially. Demissie tweeted Sunday morning that Saturday had been Booker's biggest online fundraising day of the campaign, hauling in $300,000.  Other candidates were looking for a break-out at the Steak Fry in front of a crowd so large that it would have accounted for 5% of the total turnout in Iowa's record-breaking 2008 Democratic caucuses.  As Warren lingered at the Steak Fry for hours to greet and take pictures with attendees, Castro jumped into the line, and the two had a warm exchange.   Harris' campaign has  mastered the art of the entrance . She walked into the Steak Fry dancing alongside a marching drumline.  O'Rourke had one of the day's most memorable moments when he repeated his call for mandatory assault-style rifle buy-backs. He also took a jab at Democratic leaders in Washington, saying they should not ""live in fear"" of Trump and the National Rifle Association, days after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had said no other members of the party agree with O'Rourke's position.  ""This is how we free ourselves from fear. We decide what we believe in and we fight like hell to achieve it -- and we don't let anyone, whether it's the NRA, the corporations, or the political action committees, or even our fellow Democrats tell us what is possible and what is not possible,"" O'Rourke said. ""We the people decide what is possible in this country.""  ""I thought Beto really got people motivated,"" said Ray Johnson, a 67-year-old consumer protection worker in West Des Moines.  He and his wife said they were also considering backing O'Rourke, as well as Warren and Buttigieg, and said they were most concerned with who will defeat Trump. Johnson said he likes Biden, but thinks Democrats need someone younger who can excite voters.  Buttigieg, meanwhile, is seeking to leverage the eye-popping $25 million he raised in the last fundraising quarter in Iowa, where he is already on the air with television ads.  His campaign bought the second-most tickets to the Steak Fry after Biden, and turned in the day's most raucous appearance as a light rain fell in Des Moines.  Then, Buttigieg started a four-day bus tour of Iowa -- with reporters in tow and allowed to ask the candidate questions at any point.  At the Steak Fry, Nikki Lunden, a 41-year-old warehouse worker from Iowa City, said Buttigieg is her favorite candidate -- but most importantly, she wants to support ""who's going to win it.""  Robert Hein, who had driven from Minnesota -- a Super Tuesday state -- with his wife Amy, said he was ""thinking maybe somebody young might be the better choice"" after hearing former President Jimmy Carter say there should be an ""age limit"" for the presidency that would exclude Biden. He said he was already impressed by Buttigieg and left even more so. He said Biden represents ""a guarantee that we can get Trump out of there.""  ""But the more I listen to these folks, I think there are a good number of them who have a good shot at beating him in November,"" he said. "
"Here's what else you need to know to  Get Up to Speed and Out the Door . (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily.  Sign up here .) 1. Impeachment inquiry The notion that has floated around some Democratic circles since the day Donald Trump was inaugurated, through months of Mueller report drama and endless cycles of controversy, was brought to light yesterday when Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced  the House will open a formal impeachment inquiry  into the President's conduct. The move was made after Trump  admitted to withholding aid to Ukraine  before a scheduled call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In that call, Trump pushed Zelensky to look into dealings involving the son of his possible 2020 rival, Joe Biden. Trump insists the two things aren't related, and the White House as soon as today  is expected to release  a transcript of the Zelensky call and a whistleblower's report related to it.  So, what happens now?  Usually the inquiry would go to a full House vote, but Pelosi has told the six House committees already investigating Trump to proceed ""under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry."" They will decide whether the President has committed any ""impeachable offenses,"" defined as ""Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."" That could mean a whole lot of things, or nothing at all, so expect this part to be extremely contentious. Any articles of impeachment would be subject to a House vote followed by a Senate trial. Ultimately, there's a whole ocean between impeachment and removal from office, especially since Republicans control the Senate. In opening this chapter, Pelosi said: ""The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law."" Oh, and on top of it all, Zelensky and Trump  are scheduled to have their first face-to-face meeting  today on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. There could certainly be a lot to talk about.  2. Climate crisis Before the impeachment news rocked the political sphere, President Trump singled out a very different adversary: Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. After the 16-year-old's fiery speech Monday at the UN,  Trump responded to a video of her  with a seemingly mocking message: ""She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!"" Thunberg ended up using his words in her Twitter bio. Meanwhile,  Fox News apologized to the teen  after conservative pundit Michael Knowles called Thunberg ""a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left."" The show's other guest and host both admonished Knowles on air. Thunberg has Asperger's and has said her diagnosis is a ""superpower"" that helps her activism. 3. Zimbabwe Zimbabwe's water crisis just got more desperate. The main water treatment plant in the capital city of Harare was shut down Monday,  leaving 1 million people without tap water . Authorities are now scrambling to secure water purifying chemicals to keep up with the need for clean water, and people have resorted to digging makeshift wells on their property. Zimbabwe was hit by a severe drought between October 2018 and May. Besides the water crisis, the UN food agency says more than 2 million Zimbabweans face starvation.  4. Navy suicides  The US Navy has confirmed that three sailors assigned to the USS George H. W. Bush aircraft carrier off the coast of Virginia  died by suicide in ""separate incidents""  last week and has launched an investigation into their deaths. None of the deaths seem to be related, and the sailors all worked in different departments. Five sailors who were assigned to the carrier have died by suicide in the last two years. The Marine Corps and the Navy have been dealing with a spike in suicides recently. The number of confirmed and suspected suicides among the active duty ranks of the two branches reached a 10-year high in 2018. After last week's deaths, Capt. Sean Bailey, commanding officer of the USS George H. W. Bush, called for the naval community to come together ""to grieve, to support each other, and to care for those in need."" 5. Plácido Domingo Opera legend Plácido Domingo has  severed his artistic relationship with The Metropolitan Opera  in New York after a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him. According to the Met, the decision, which ends a 50-year professional relationship, was mutual. Domingo's image was removed yesterday from the ""Macbeth"" page on the Met Opera's official website. The show was set to open today, with Domingo in the lead role. In August, the Associated Press reported that nine women detailed alleged incidents of sexual harassment spanning three decades beginning in the late 1980s. In September, 11 more people came forward with allegations that included verbal harassment and groping.

"Pelosi announces plans to go forward; Mike Emanuel has the details. We've grown used to radical Leftists, in Congress and the media, having their  soup de jour , the accusation of the day. But this latest one has actually prompted  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  to announce a formal impeachment inquiry. What is the accusation? President  Donald Trump  called the Ukrainian president to congratulate him on his election and discussed several things, including the investigation of alleged illegal conduct on the part of the son of a prominent American politician. This is just another fail. Within the past few weeks, the Left has floated impeaching Supreme Court Justice  Brett Kavanaugh , criticized Vice President Mike Pence for an extended stay during a visit to his foreign, historical family home, melted down over the President’s invitation of national leaders of the G7 to one of his properties, and most ludicrously, blasted him for allegedly stealing pancakes. HANS VON SPAKOVSKY: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT EFFORT WILL BE HISTORIC POLITICAL BATTLE – HERE'S HOW THE PROCESS WORKS The media wonders why its credibility is in the dumpster. The Left wonders why the President has the approval of most Americans, higher than former President Barack Obama at the same juncture of his term. The standard bearer of the latest effort to impeach President Trump is Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of the House intelligence Committee. You will remember him for his zealous advocacy for reliance on the Mueller Report. Schiff promised that evidence of Russian collusion was real, present, and would be confirmed in the Mueller Report. Oops. The Mueller investigation did not support Schiff’s promised conclusion. In fact, it found that there was no collusion, cooperation or coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. So here we are again. The Democrats desire to get the transcript of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This seems wholly unwarranted based on the allegations of an unknown person, who probably did not even hear the conversation. This individual apparently heard about the conversation from someone else. Such testimony would never be allowed in court because it is inherently unreliable. Ukraine's foreign minister says there were no threats on the call. There was nothing untoward or out of the ordinary in the conversation. And, it reveals something about the way things work in the White House. It seems that the President has no private conversations with leaders of foreign countries. I suspect that the leaders of other nations understand that those conversations are scrutinized by the U.S. intelligence apparatus. But I also believe that foreign leaders do not anticipate that Americans are so cavalier as to transcribe these conversations and then pass them on to Congress, which seems to have the loosest of lips. In fact, foreign leaders probably do not realize there is a threat that their conversations could be leaked, if given to Schiff, a person that former Congressman Trey Gowdy has described as leakier than a screen-door on a submarine. What do the Ukrainian leaders have to say about the content of the conversation? Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko says there were no threats. There was nothing untoward or out of the ordinary in the conversation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER But, in a bid for moral equivalence, let’s consider the Bidens, who were the purported object of at least part of the phone conversation. Joe Biden once bragged that he had been in Ukraine and demanded that its leaders fire a prosecutor who was investigating allegations of wrongdoing of an international energy company, or else. Oh, by the way, Biden’s son, Hunter, sat on the board of directors of that company. Was it out of line to inquire of an American who was under investigation by the Ukrainians? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP How about the projection of the Left? They projected a false narrative for years, creating a division in our nation that may not heal for a generation, that the Trump administration is illegitimate because of Russian “collusion” in the 2016 election. But, it turns out, that Ukrainians donated tens of millions of dollars to the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee. In fact, the Ukraine government voted to investigate that. Prediction: the Left will persist in its quixotic quest to remove President Donald Trump. And, when the Ukraine telephone gambit fades, look for the next stolen pancake allegation to consume our misguided friends. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP. ANDY BIGGS"
"In an interview with CBS Sunday Morning host Jane Pauley that was released on Thursday, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee gave her thoughts on the race between her and Trump as well as the 2020 election.  ""Well, I hope not, and I don't think so -- because the objective is to field whoever is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump,"" Clinton said when asked if she thought it would be harder for a woman to be elected President. ""Because Donald Trump right now poses a direct threat, a clear and present danger to the institutions of our government, to the rule of law, to our standing in the world."" ""I believe that, look there were many funny things that happened in my election that will not happen again. And I'm hoping that both the public and press understand the way Trump plays the game,"" Clinton said. When asked if she gets upset that Trump continues to say she should be ""locked up,"" a notion that is often chanted at his rallies, Clinton said, ""No, it doesn't kill me because he knows he's an illegitimate President."" ""You know, Jane, it was like applying for a job and getting 66 million letters of recommendation and losing to a corrupt human tornado,"" Clinton said. ""And so I know that he knows, that this wasn't on the level. I don't know that we'll ever know what happened."" On Wednesday,  Clinton said  Trump ""betrayed"" the United States following the release of a transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and said she supported an impeachment inquiry into the President. According to a transcript of the conversation released by the White House, Trump repeatedly pushed for Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, during a July 25 phone call. At an appearance Thursday night with the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) in Washington, DC, Clinton said Trump ""has betrayed his oath of office to uphold the Constitution and protect and defend our country."" ""But I think it is fair to say we have known who Donald Trump is for some time now. We knew he was a corrupt businessman who cheated people,"" Clinton said. ""We knew that his campaign invited foreign adversaries to tamper with our elections and now we know that in the course of his duties as our President he's endangered us all by putting his personal and political interests ahead of the interests of the America people."" Clinton also noted the twist of irony that she worked on former President Richard Nixon's impeachment hearings in the 1970s.  ""There's so much more at stake because it's not just what we now know happened in a phone call between this President and his counterpart in Ukraine. We are living through a crisis in our democracy,"" she said."
"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's connection to Ukraine is the 'least best-kept secret in Washington,' says California Congressman Devin Nunes, Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee. A House Democrat said Monday it's time for  2020 presidential  hopeful  Joe Biden  to ""clear up"" the questions surrounding his son's  Ukrainian  business dealings. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, appeared on CNN and responded to a clip of  Fox News' Peter Doocy  asking Biden if he had ever spoken to his son, Hunter, about his foreign business affairs. Hunter has been tied to a natural gas firm in Ukraine that was involved in a corruption probe. Biden said he had never spoken with his son about such matters. But according to a  New Yorker  report in July, Hunter Biden said he had discussed his business in Ukraine with his father. ""Well, clearly something needs to be cleared up at this point,"" Gonzalez replied. ""So, yes, of course, I would want an explanation on that."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo weighed in on Biden's Ukranian ties during a ""Fox News Sunday"" interview and even mentioned the possibility of the Democratic front-runner being involved in an election scandal. UKRAINE PHONE CALL SCANDAL IS MEDIA STRIKING BACK AFTER FAILED RUSSIA HOAX, SAYS DAN BONGINO ""I do hope that if Vice President Biden engaged in behavior that was inappropriate -- if he had a conflict of interest, or allowed something to take place in Ukraine which may have interfered in our elections in 2016, I do hope that we get to the bottom of that,"" said Pompeo. There is also talk of Biden's campaign facing irreparable damage, with  Rep. Devin Nunes , R-Calif., suggesting his bid for the White House could end due to the controversy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""These stories first originated back when  Hillary Clinton  was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race,"" Nunes said on  ""Sunday Morning Futures""  this week. ""So now that these have been resurrected, I don’t know who came up with the scheme -- maybe this whistleblower really is not a partisan. We want to hear from that whistleblower, but it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And, like I said, it looks like this is the end of Biden’s campaign. I really do... his lead is basically down to zero."" Fox News Gregg Re contributed to this report"

"Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard joins Brian Kilmeade on 'Fox &amp; Friends.' Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , D-Hawaii, said Tuesday she will not join with other  House Democrats  in supporting the impeachment of  President Trump . The push for  impeachment  has picked up steam in recent days, including from  Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., in response to a whistleblower complaint that reportedly alleged Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate  Joe Biden  and his son, Hunter Biden. Gabbard, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in a crowded field, said on  ""Fox & Friends""  that she has been consistent in saying that victory in the 2020 election, not impeachment, is the way for Democrats to make sure Trump leaves office. SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL ""I believe that impeachment at this juncture would be terribly divisive for the country at a time when we are already extremely divided. The hyperpartisanship is one of the main things driving our country apart,"" she told host Brian Kilmeade. Gabbard's comments are in contrast to many of her Democratic colleagues, including Warren, one of the top contenders in the presidential race. ""The House must impeach. It must start today,"" Warren tweeted Tuesday morning. In addition, a slew of key swing-district Democrats  threw their support  en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as  The New York Times ,  The Washington Post  and  The Wall Street Journal  reported Monday that Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens.

Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register’s poll. Former Vice President Biden, who had led each of the Register’s three previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%. No other candidate reaches double digits. ‘This is the first major shakeup’ in what had been a fairly steady race, said  J. Ann Selzer , president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. … South Bend, Indiana, Mayor  Pete Buttigieg  follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen.  Kamala Harris  of California is at 6%. U.S. Sens.  Amy Klobuchar  of Minnesota and  Cory Booker  of New Jersey are at 3%. Polling at 2% are U.S. Rep.  Tulsi Gabbard  of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep.  Beto O’Rourke  of Texas, businessman  Tom Steyer  and entrepreneur  Andrew Yang .” Dem candidates take two approaches in Iowa -  Des Moines Register:  “Former Vice President Joe Biden brought in a fire truck, bouncy house and ice cream truck for a carnival-style ‘Biden fest.’ A Mariachi band played at former U.S. Housing Secretary  Juliàn Castro ’s rally site and then marched in with the candidate and his supporters. And  Lizzo  and  Prince  blared through the speakers at a gathering for U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. But others took a different tack: U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren focused on organizing supporters, gathering voter information and knocking doors rather than big displays of support. Saturday’s Polk County Steak Fry in Iowa was the largest in the event’s storied history, drawing more than 12,000 excited Democrats to Water Works Park, where they heard from 17 presidential candidates vying for their attention and support on caucus day. Many of the candidates gathered with their supporters ahead of the main event, holding rallies where they each tried to outshine their competitors.” Voters dislike Trump, still have doubts about Dems -  NBC News:  “As Democratic candidates compete for the opportunity to take on President  Donald Trump , the incumbent they hope to oust is more personally disliked than any of his recent predecessors, and half of voters say they’re very uncomfortable with the idea of his re-election. But the electorate at large also expresses doubts about some of the progressive policies being backed by candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and the party’s more moderate frontrunner — Joe Biden — also faces questions about his fitness for the job. Those are the major findings in the latest release from the September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll… But Trump also continues to benefit from the upside of the polarization of the electorate around him, commanding more enthusiasm than his Democratic competitors as well. A quarter of voters (26 percent) say they’re enthusiastic about him, while fewer say they’re enthusiastic about Warren (17 percent), Sanders (13 percent) and Biden (12 percent.)” The end may be near for Booker -  Politico:  “Cory Booker’s presidential campaign is betting it all on the next 10 days, signaling Saturday that it will cease to exist unless it can raise nearly $2 million by the end of the month. ‘We have reached a critical moment, and time is running out,’ campaign manager  Addisu Demissie  warned in a memo to Booker staff and supporters. ‘It’s now or never: The next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race and compete to win the nomination.’ The bottom line, Demissie said, is that ‘we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward’ if the campaign can’t raise another $1.7 million by Sept. 30, the third-quarter fundraising deadline. … Demissie made clear on a conference call with reporters later Saturday that the campaign isn’t out of money or at risk of running out of funds.” THE RULEBOOK: GOOD CALL GUYS  “For the sake of certainty and uniformity, therefore, the power of defining felonies in this case was in every respect necessary and proper.” –  James Madison ,  Federalist No. 42 TIME OUT: MEET YOU IN ST.

IMPEACHMENT PRESSURE BUILDS AROUND TRUMP PHONE CALL NYT:  “ President Trump  acknowledged on Sunday that he raised corruption accusations against former Vice President  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  during a phone call with Ukraine’s leader, a stunning admission as pressure mounted on Democrats to impeach Mr. Trump over allegations he leaned on a foreign government to help damage a political rival. In public and in private, many Democrats said the evidence that has emerged in recent days indicating that Mr. Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden, and his administration’s stonewalling of attempts by Congress to learn more, were changing their calculations about whether to charge him with articles of impeachment. … The fast-moving developments prompted Speaker  Nancy Pelosi  to level a warning of her own to the White House: Turn over the secret whistle-blower complaint by Thursday, or face a serious escalation from Congress. In a letter to House Democrats, Ms. Pelosi never mentioned the word ‘impeachment,’ but her message hinted at that possibility.” Trump continues to defend his call about Biden -  Politico:  “President Donald Trump on Monday intensified his attempts to justify a phone call with Ukraine’s president in which he reportedly pushed for an investigation into one of his chief political rivals, maintaining that he’s merely concerned about stamping out corruption. He once again dismissed the accusations that he was using his position of power to pressure a foreign government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son as a ‘witch hunt.’ For the first time, however, Trump appeared to connect the idea to the issue of foreign aid. ‘If we're supporting a country, we want to make sure that country is honest,’ Trump told reporters after arriving for the U.N. General Assembly. … Also at issue with critics of the president is $250 million in foreign aid meant for Ukraine that the White House mysteriously withheld before releasing under bipartisan pressure early this month. There is no evidence that Trump directly tied the release of foreign aid to an investigation into Biden and his son.” Schumer insists on hearings over whistleblower complaint -  Politico:  “Senate Minority Leader  Chuck Schumer  is requesting that the Republican Senate conduct hearings and issue a subpoena to the Trump administration in response to a whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump's alleged request that Ukraine investigate one of his political opponents. In a letter to Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell  (R-Ky.) on Monday morning, the New York Democrat said the Senate should hold hearings regarding any connection between delayed aid to Ukraine and Trump's reported request that the country probe the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender in next year's presidential election. Schumer also asks McConnell to compel the Senate to issue a subpoena to bring the whistleblower complaint to Congress ‘as required by law.’” Giuliani accuses Ukraine of laundering $3M to Hunter Biden -   Fox News:  “ Rudy Giuliani  channeled President Trump Monday with a wee-hours Twitter blitz aimed at turning the Ukraine story currently roiling Washington into a big problem for Democrats. Giuliani, the personal attorney for Trump and outspoken critic of presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son’s relationship with Ukraine, accused Kiev of laundering $3 million to  Hunter Biden , suggested that the Obama administration turned a blind eye, and made the prediction that the scandal is in its infancy. ‘If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,’ he tweeted. ‘Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?’” CONGRESS SET TO PASS STOPGAP SPENDING BILL THIS WEEK  Roll Call:  “The Senate needs to act this week to clear a stopgap spending bill before recessing through the end of the government’s fiscal year, but that is really the only must-pass business for either chamber. The House passed the measure Thursday, 301-123, after resolving hangups that included a debate over assisting farmers who have seen demand for crops plummet thanks to the ongoing sparring over trade with China. … There is no expectation the Senate will have trouble reaching an agreement to clear the measure to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, but it is certainly not the only piece of business that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to advance. … Once the House is back Tuesday, Democrats will once again turn their attention to border politics as the chamber considers two measures designed to improve the Department of Homeland Security’s treatment of migrants.” PLAY-BY-PLAY Check this out: Inside Fox News’ polling ‘nerdquarium’  -  LAT Team Trump growing more concerned about Michigan  -  Politico Rand Paul  interfering with  Liz Cheney  Senate run  -   Politico Alaska Republicans cancel 2020 presidential primary  -  Anchorage Daily News AUDIBLE: *MIC DROP* “So many people seem to think that judges are just like politicians with robes.

"California Republican Rep. Devin Nunes on the whistleblower complaint against Trump, the IG report on alleged FISA abuse and privacy concerns with big tech. California  Rep. Devin Nunes  predicted on Fox News'  ""Sunday Morning Futures""  that  Joe Biden's  campaign is likely coming to an end -- all because of newly resurfaced reports about his  possible misconduct in Ukraine  that ""first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race."" The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee made the claim as  The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll  showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren  surging ahead of Biden  as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. Biden held a 9-point lead over Warren in the poll as recently as June. Nunes, speaking to anchor Maria Bartiromo, said a whistleblower's allegation that President Trump had acted inappropriately during a July 25 phone call with  Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelensky will ultimately backfire, and shine a light on Biden's own possible misconduct. CNN later  acknowledged  that the whistleblower had no first-hand knowledge of the call, and a top  Ukrainian  official on Saturday  defended Trump's  actions. FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED ""These stories first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race,"" Nunes said. ""So now that these have been resurrected, I don’t know who came up with the scheme -- maybe this whistleblower really is not a partisan. We want to hear from that whistleblower, but it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And, like I said, it looks like this is the end of Biden’s campaign. I really do... his lead is basically down to zero."" Late Sunday, Trump echoed Nunes' comments, and emphasized that Biden recently  bragged  about pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor when he was vice president. At the time, the prosecutor was probing a company closely linked to Biden's son, Hunter. ""Sleepy Joe Biden ... forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""That's the real story!"" Nunes said the ever-deepening schism in the Democratic Party over whether to impeach the president -- highlighted late Saturday when New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  called it a major ""scandal"" that Democrats hadn't yet voted to impeach  -- would help Trump in 2020. ""The more I think that they’re out there promoting this kind of craziness and silliness, the more that the American people are put off, and the more likely President Trump is reelected,” Nunes added. There were parallels, Nunes said, with Democrats' ultimately debunked claims that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. ""This has all the hallmarks of the Russia hoax,"" Nunes said. ""Something leaks out. ... and then it's the same reporters that report on it, the same reporters that reported on the Russia hoax. Then you move forward, and what happens? Then supposedly they come and testify -- and the night before they testify, the whistleblower who supposedly doesn't want anybody to know who this person is, or what information they have, well, it's spilled all over the pages of the Washington Post"" the day before Congress was briefed on the matter. WATCH: LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS NO ONE HAS REALLY LOOKED INTO BIDENS AND THEIR DEALINGS IN UKRAINE ""Whoever came up with this scheme -- it looks like somebody was trying to deflect what Biden did back in 2015,"" Nunes said. ""This scheme seems to have backfired on Biden. I mean, Biden's already dropping in the polls.""

       The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump had repeatedly asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son who had a key role in a natural gas firm that was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor as part of a corruption probe. At a conference two years after he left office, Joe Biden  openly boasted  about successfully pressuring Ukraine to  fire that prosecutor  when he was vice president. Unverified reports  circulated on left-leaning media outlets  claiming that Trump could have even promised something improper in exchange for Ukraine's compliance, although the Journal reported there was no ""quid-pro-quo"" involved. Trump  acknowledged Sunday  that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned ""the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."" However, the president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS THERE WAS NO PRESSURE DNI Inspector General Michael Atkinson said in a Sep. 9 letter to the House Intelligence Committee that the whistleblower complaint ""appeared credible"" and related to an ""urgent"" matter. But the DNI general counsel said days later that, after consulting with the DOJ, the matter did not meet the legal definition of an “urgent concern,"" and was not subject to mandatory disclosure to Congress. “Furthermore, because the complaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community, the DNI lacks unilateral authority to transmit such materials to the intelligence committees,”  Jason Klitenic, the DNI general counsel, wrote. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday. ""At that time, we expect him to obey the law and turn over the whistleblower’s full complaint to the Committee,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement Sunday afternoon. ""We also expect that he will establish a path for the whistleblower to speak directly to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as required by law."" 
      House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., suggested Sunday that impeachment may be on the table, if certain demands are not met ahead of Wednesday's whistleblower hearing. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)
       Pelosi also seemingly threatened that she would back impeachment if her demands were not met, in a potentially major shift to her wait-and-see approach thus far: ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation."" Trump's conversation came as the White House was holding up $250 million in military aid for Ukraine. The president has said he wants European countries to pay more for their own defense, and  denied delaying any military aid funding. The whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he  privately threatened then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko  that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired. “I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'"" “Well, son of a b-tch, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.” It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. And earlier this year, The Hill  reported  that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros.

       Then, in April, Ukrainian law enforcement officials said they had a  slew of evidence of collusion and wrongdoing by Democrats , and that they have been trying to share this information with U.S. officials in the Justice Department. A  2017 investigation by Politico  found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory. Trump  told Fox News  that the allegations of possible Clinton-Ukraine collusion were ""big"" and vowed they would be reviewed by the DOJ. Additionally, attention focused anew on  President Obama's hot-mic comment to then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev  at a nuclear disarmament summit in March 2012, in which Obama was overheard saying he would have more ""flexibility"" to negotiate with Russia after the November 2012 election. ""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who believe Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy. Meanwhile, Biden on Saturday denied he has ever spoken to Hunter about his business in Ukraine and called Trump's actions an ""overwhelming abuse of power."" “Trump’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum, and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,” Biden  told reporters in Iowa . But Trump, on Sunday, pointed out that Biden's claim was seemingly inaccurate. Hunter Biden told the  New Yorker  previously that he and his father had spoken “just once” about it. “And now he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,” Trump said. “Of course you spoke to your son!” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump added: ""No quid pro quo, there was nothing. It was a perfect conversation. ... The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems. The new president is saying that he's going to be able to rid the country of corruption, and I said that would be a great thing, we had a great conversation."" Trump went on to say the latest allegations are ""just as ridiculous as the others,"" branding it ""the Ukraine Witch Hunt"" — a nod to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. ""Will fail again!"" Trump tweeted. Fox News' Ronn Blitzer, Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Chris Stirewalt on Cory Booker's campaign memo Democratic presidential candidate  Sen. Cory Booker's, D-N.J. , recent campaign memo may foreshadow some drastic change in the  2020 field , according to Chris Stirewalt. The missive,  from Booker campaign manager Addisu Demissie , may signal the potential withdrawal of a handful of lower-tier candidates in the coming months -- therefore shaking up the support structure of the front-runners, Stirewalt claimed Monday on "" Special Report ."" ""It's reflective of what's about to happen -- what's going on in the field and what's going to continue to happen,"" he said. ""We're finally reaching a period where there's the possibility for some real substantive change in the composition, as the two-percenters and three-percenters drop out... As those candidates wash out, their vote share gets reapportioned."" CORY BOOKER MEMO WARNS CANDIDATE MAY NOT BE IN RACE 'MUCH LONGER' WITHOUT FUNDRAISING BOOST The Fox News digital politics editor added that although the lower-tier candidates do not command the same voter support as people like  former Vice President Joe Biden  or  Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , those voters will still have to shift their support somewhere. ""That's where Biden's opportunity to hold the line is -- to hold on to that share as it comes to him,"" Stirewalt added. In an MSNBC interview, Booker said he doesn't want to ""stick around"" if he's not ""in this to win it"" -- however adding the last couple days have drawn a windfall in fundraising numbers. In Demissie's memo, the campaign warned Booker must raise $1.7 million by the end of the third fundraising quarter in order to have a likely path to the nomination. The existence of the memo was first reported Saturday morning by NBC News, with Fox News confirming the news with multiple sources. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Two sources, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said it was no accident that the memo was leaked, and described it as an effort to spark a surge in fundraising over the next 10 days. On "" Special Report ,"" Stirewalt added the former Newark mayor's apparent plea for financial support is an ultimatum to supporters. ""It's like the old 'National Lampoon' cover -- buy this magazine or we'll shoot this dog. Give me the money or I will have to quit. It's a desperation play,"" he said."
"South Bend mayor says the amateur model is 'not fair' to college athletes; Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren weighs in. Democratic presidential hopeful  Pete Buttigieg  said on Monday that the model for  college football  has become ""problematic,” explaining that the system has become unfair to college  athletes . ""First, you need to look at what we owe students. Obviously the model says you get an education in exchange for contributing this way, plus the sport is supposed to be its own reward, but I don’t think that that’s really fair anymore. ... It's problematic and I don't have a solution,"" the South Bend, Indiana mayor said, according to  Jewish Insider . NCAA TELLS CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR COLLEGE ATHLETE 'FAIR PAY' BILL IS 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL' Buttigieg went on to note the massive popularity of the sport in his hometown, which is home to the campus of Notre Dame. “I think about it from a perspective of a city that relies on college football in the same way that Bahrain relies on fossil fuel.” Buttigieg also  said  that he has “qualms” about letting a child play football and favors soccer. NCAA TO CONSIDER ALLOWING ATHLETES TO CASH IN ON THEIR NAMES His comments came after the California State Assembly voted 72-0 to pass a bill  allowing college athletes to profit from their name, image and likeness . The bill is championed by many athletes in the collegiate and professional ranks, such as Lebron James. The state Senate passed the measure 39-0. Following Buttigieg's comments, Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren said the debate about paying college athletes is a valid topic, but it seems like Democrats have an ever-growing list of things that are ""problematic"" in American society. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Is it just me or do liberals just want to take the fun out of everything? They want to take away your straws, your cheeseburgers and now your college football because now that's morally problematic as well. It seems like everything and every American tradition, for the Democrats, is problematic in some way,” Lahren said on ""Fox & Friends First."" Lahren also said that Buttigieg's lack of solution on the matter is typical of Democrats and his message does not resonate with average Americans, especially those in Iowa.

       Nunes says whistleblower controversy could have unintended casualty: Joe Biden's 2020 campaign   
On Sunday, Trump addressed reports that a whistleblower complaint may have accused him of wrongdoing related to a July phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, and insisted that there was “absolutely nothing wrong” with the substance of the discussion. The president reportedly has been accused of asking Ukraine’s leader multiple times to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden’s son and using military aid as leverage. Trump denied making any improper requests,  but he did point fingers at Biden .

       The Democratic presidential hopeful’s son Hunter Biden had been investigated related to business interests. In the past, Joe Biden has said the U.S. would  withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired , but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to his son's case. Trump accused Biden of being dishonest in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling the New Yorker that they spoke “just once” about it. In an interview with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said the whistleblower complaint will have unintended consequences and  shine light on Joe Biden's own misconduct - and ultimately end his 2020 campaign . Amid AOC pressure, Pelosi suggests Trump impeachment back on the table because of whistleblower complaint 
Just hours after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said her party's failure so far to impeach President Trump amounted to a major ""national scandal,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared to relent on Sunday -- and  warn that a ""whole new stage of investigation"" could be approaching  because of the reported whistleblower complaint against the president. Pelosi, who has long resisted calls to impeach Trump because the move would imperil the electability of moderate Democrats in the House, the whistleblower who alleged Trump acted improperly in his phone call with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy must be allowed to speak to Congress, and the full whistleblower complaint must be provided.  Blackface scandal damages Trudeau at polls as he vows lower taxes, cellphone costs 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday worked to start putting last week’s blackface scandal behind him and focused on policies he said he’d pursue if re-elected, including lower cellphone costs and a middle-class tax cut, according to reports.  However, the scandal may have torpedoed his lead in the polls . Trudeau apologized several times for the multiple images that emerged last week showing him in blackface at different parties and events while he was in his teens and 20s. But pollster Frank Graves of EKOS Research told Reuters that polls have shifted and the gap between his campaign and the opposition Conservatives has narrowed. Graves said he will release the poll numbers later this week, but told the news outlet that Trudeau’s lead has “evaporated almost overnight.”

"Klopfer died on September 3 and his family  was going through his belongings at his home  in Will County, about 45 miles from Chicago, when they found the medically preserved remains, authorities said. They were inside small, sealed plastic bags that contained a chemical used to preserve biological material, Will County Sheriff Mike Kelley told reporters at a news conference Thursday. They were in boxes that were mixed in with other storage boxes  ""I can tell you, the 31 years I've been doing this job, I have never seen anything like this, ever. It is a strange, one of those once-in-a-lifetime things,"" he said.  Klopfer operated three abortion clinics in South Bend, Indiana, before his license was suspended in 2015. County officials estimated how long the remains had been preserved but did not provide details on how they determined they were from nearly two decades ago. ""The condition they are in, it is clear that they are older,"" said James Glasgow, Will County state's attorney.  Klopfer did not follow Indiana law for disposal of the fetal remains and the filing of the proper paperwork, Glasgow said. The remains will be transferred to the custody of the Indiana attorney general.  An attorney representing the doctor's family called the Will County coroner's office on September 12 to inform them the family had discovered what appeared to be the remains of fetuses and asked for assistance in removing them, the Will County Sheriff's Office said. Detectives arrived at the address and the coroner's office took the remains. The family is cooperating with the investigation.  There is no evidence any medical procedures were conducted at the doctor's property, according to the sheriff's office.  Anti-abortion groups have gathered at the site of his former clinics to demand the identification and burial of the remains,  CNN affiliate WNDU reported.  One woman  told WNDU  that she was raped as a minor and had an abortion at one of Klopfer's clinics. ""For me, closure would be just know if my baby was on his property so that I can just have a proper burial,"" Serena Dyksen said.  South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, called for an investigation. ""Like everyone, I find the news out of Illinois extremely disturbing, and I think it's important that it be fully investigated,"" Buttigieg  said Wednesday . ""I also hope it doesn't get caught up in politics at a time when women need access to health care. There's no question that what happened is disturbing. It's unacceptable. And it needs to be looked into fully."""
"White House provides unredacted text of President Trump's phone call with Ukraine's new leader Volodymyr Zelensky. President Trump  is trying to turn lemons into lemonade amid the House Democratic impeachment push against him. Trump’s campaign on Wednesday sent out a fundraising email that slams House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., and other House Democrats for launching an impeachment inquiry after a whistleblower’s complaint suggesting Trump sought the help of a foreign government in his bid for re-election. “This is just another smear job and a pathetic attempt by Democrats to rip the power from the people,” the Trump campaign email stated. “I’VE DONE NOTHING WRONG. TRUST ME, YOU SAW THE TRANSCRIPT.” READ THE UKRAINE CALL MEMO The White House on Wednesday  released a transcript of Trump’s July phone call  with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing Trump broached a review of Biden family dealings in the country. The memo begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory, before Trump eventually touches on the subject former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.” PELOSI ANNOUNCES IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY  This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention. In the fundraising email, the Trump campaign calls the impeachment inquiry a “witch hunt” – a term frequently used by the president during the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election – and announces his campaign’s “Impeachment Defense Task Force.” The email does not go into details about what the task force will do or who will head it up. “The Democrats’ constant personal attacks, vicious lies, and now these baseless impeachment attacks, have never had anything to do with me,” the email from the Trump campaign said. “This is only the beginning of yet ANOTHER nasty Witch Hunt against me, and we need to fight back BIGGER and STRONGER than ever before.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The Trump campaign's manager, Brad Parscale, released a separate statement Wednesday saying, ""The facts prove the President did nothing wrong. This is just another hoax from Democrats and the media, contributing to the landslide re-election of President Trump in 2020.” In her remarks Tuesday, Pelosi specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal."" ""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella. ""The president must be held accountable,"" she continued. ""No one is above the law."" Fox News Alex Pappas and Gregg Re contributed to this report."
"However, some senior administration officials, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, are against the idea because of the precedent releasing it could set with future foreign leaders. At particular issue: White House concern about giving Congress ammunition to demand transcripts of Trump's calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump's acknowledgment that he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden in a July call with Ukraine's president has intensified scrutiny on his interactions and decisions on Ukraine. On Friday CNN reported Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump remained unclear about the fate of the transcript on Monday, speaking about the Ukraine controversy multiple times during his visit to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. ""Perhaps you'll see it, perhaps you won't see that, it depends on what we want to do,"" Trump said of the transcript. The President again denied that he threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine unless the country's leaders did his bidding and investigated the Bidens. ""I did not make a statement that, 'You have to do this or I'm not going to give you aid.' I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that,"" he said. But Trump again suggested he hoped to release a transcript of his conversation.  ""It was a very nice call. I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon,"" he said. More mixed signals House Democrats have demanded to see the full complaint a whistleblower filed last month with the intelligence community inspector general -- a document the administration, including the White House Counsel's Office and the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel -- has fought to keep secret. The complaint includes the Ukraine call, a source told CNN, but may not necessarily be limited to that one incident. Over the weekend, White House officials solicited opinions from outside advisers about whether they should release the transcript of Trump's call with the Zelensky, as well as how advisers think the White House should message it if the transcript was ""embarrassing."" A person familiar with the discussions said the White House Counsel's Office is currently involved in evaluating whether the transcript should be released and in what form. The source said the release could happen ""soon."" But Stephanie Grisham, White House press secretary, sounded a reluctant note this morning on Fox News. ""I do think that perhaps releasing this kind of a transcript could set a bad precedent. He is willing to do it, I think. But there is a lot of other people, lawyers and such that may have a problem with it. So we will see what happens,"" Grisham said. Officials are also looking at potential redactions of Zelensky's portion of the conversation. On Saturday, Trump raised the possibility of releasing a transcript of the call to a ""respected source"" for review. In March, White House counsel Pat Cipillone sent a letter to Congress saying the administration would not release any conversations Trump has had with foreign leaders, citing longstanding precedent. That letter came in the context of White House efforts to shield Trump's conversations with Putin. But releasing the Zelensky call could undermine the White House's pre-existing efforts to keep those Putin conversations secret, which is one of several concerns inside the White House over putting out details of the call. 'A terrible precedent' Another concern -- voiced on the Sunday shows by Pompeo and Mnuchin -- is that publishing the call could chill candor when Trump speaks with foreign leaders in the future. Both suggested Trump requires an expectation of privacy in order to conduct diplomacy effectively.   ""I think that would be a terrible precedent,"" Mnuchin said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""Conversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential, and if every time someone for political reasons raised a question, and all of a sudden those conversations were disclosed publicly ... then why would world leaders want to have conversations together?"" Pompeo echoed a similar reservation. ""We don't release transcripts very often. It's the rare case. Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn't be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances. There's no, there's no evidence that would be appropriate here at this point,"" Pompeo  said on ABC's ""This Week."" A number of political advisers have urged the White House to release it, with full knowledge of the diplomatic concerns cited by Mnuchin and Pompeo over the weekend.  ""Otherwise, it looks like we're hiding something far more nefarious,"" one person said. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, publicly urged Trump to publish the transcript on Monday and hinted the White House could do so in the days ahead. ""I would just urge the President ... to release as much as possible. And here's what I think -- I think you're going to find (out) more about that phone call in the coming days,"" Graham said during on appearance on Hugh Hewitt's radio show. ""You're going to be surprised about the level of transparency regarding that phone call."" One senior administration official said there's an understanding inside the White House that the timing of the administration's suspension of the Ukraine aid, which came around the time of Trump's call with the Ukrainian president, ""lends to a question of what was going on.""  But this official, like the President, insists there was no quid pro quo. Trump himself told reporters yesterday while leaving the White House that he wants to release the call. But he later said one way to release the call, given concerns about protecting American interests, would be to ""give it to a respected source."" He said in Houston on Sunday that if the call was released, people would ""see one of the finest, one of the nicest"" conversations."

"In a tweet, Romney, who was his party's presidential nominee in 2012, also said it was ""critical"" for the facts surrounding the call to emerge. ""If the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,"" Romney, who represents Utah, wrote in the  tweet.  The comments from the prominent GOP senator are some of the strongest to come from his party, whose members have largely remained silent following news last week that a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General was concerned in part with a July 25 call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Sunday, after Trump acknowledged that he  discussed Biden during the call  but maintained that the conversation was ""warm and friendly,"" congressional Democrats urged an investigation into the matter, with some calling for Trump's impeachment.  CNN previously reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to  investigate Biden's son, Hunter,  according to a person familiar with the situation. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump previously branded criticism of the call a ""Ukranian Witch Hunt,"" while Biden accused the President of abusing his power to ""smear"" him. In comments to reporters on Sunday, the President said he hopes officials release details of the call, but slammed the whistleblower responsible for filing a complaint. On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a strong warning to the administration, which has  refused to hand over the whistleblower complaint,  saying it ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness"" if the resistance persists. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, meanwhile, said Sunday that impeachment ""may be the only remedy"" to Trump's refusal to make public the complaint and phone call transcript. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential candidate, and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both Democrats,  urged Congress to impeach Trump  over the matter on Saturday, writing in tweets that their colleagues had an obligation to do so. "
"California Congressman Eric Swalwell, Democratic member of the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, joins Harris Faulkner on 'Outnumbered Overtime' to discuss the Trump impeachment inquiry. President Trump's  actions during a  phone call  with the president of Ukraine were ""gross"" and his behavior should make Americans question what he's said to other world leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, Rep. Eric Swalwell said Wednesday. Reacting on  ""Outnumbered Overtime""  to the release of the  transcript  of the call, which is based on ""notes and recollections"" of those who heard the conversation, Swalwell, D-Calif., said it was ""unacceptable"" for Trump to mention former Vice President  Joe Biden's  name even one time in the conversation. ""He has no business involving himself in a criminal case against his rival. We just don't do that in America. It's so gross to read that transcript. When I read that, one of my first thoughts was 'geez, what the hell does the Putin transcripts read like?' ... We know what he thinks of Putin, what has he given away to the Russians?"" he asked. READ THE UKRAINE CALL MEMO When pressed by anchor Harris Faulkner on the allegations surrounding Biden and his son's  business dealings  in Ukraine, Swalwell said there is ""no evidence"" of impropriety. HOUSE DEMOCRAT WHO ENDORSED BIDEN SAYS IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO 'CLEAR UP' QUESTIONS ON SON'S UKRAINE DEALINGS ""If you want to show me evidence, I'm open-minded,"" said the former presidential candidate. Swalwell, who was vocal in recent years alleging Trump's campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election, said if Trump asked Ukraine for help with his presidential campaign, he could have potentially owed them a favor in return. ""It's so corrupt,"" he said. The White House on Wednesday  released a transcript  of Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing he sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country — but the document does not show Trump explicitly leveraging military aid as part of a quid pro quo, as Democrats have suggested in  pressing forward with impeachment . The document, declassified by Trump a day earlier, indicates that the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25 from 9:03 a.m. to 9:33 a.m. A notation on the memo says it does not represent a ""verbatim transcript"" but is based on ""notes and recollections"" of those listening and memorializing the call. It is still presented in transcript form. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The memo begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory, before Trump eventually broaches the subject of Biden and his son Hunter. “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,” Trump said in the phone call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.” Fox News' Alex Pappas contributed to this report."
"Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden is fighting charges by Julian Castro that the former vice president's ideas are outdated; Peter Doocy reports from Houston. The Democratic National Committee’s raising the bar for  presidential candidates  to qualify for November’s fifth-round  primary debate .  But, the upping of polling and donor thresholds – more modest than the doubling of the criteria from July’s second round to this month’s third round – may not significantly winnow the field of  White House contenders  still standing after  October’s debate. The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates. OCTOBER DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE TO BE HELD IN OHIO But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar. The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria. ""Qualification period ends 1 week (not 2 weeks) before the debate, giving candidates more time to qualify,"" DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa  tweeted. The other threshold – fundraising – also saw a slight raising of the bar. To make the cut, candidates will have to receive campaign contributions from 165,000 individual donors. That’s up from 130,000 for the September and October debates and from 65,000 for the first two rounds of showdowns. Candidates also will have to receive 600 unique contributions from each of 20 states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories. The DNC’s faced criticism  over its thresholds for months from many of the lower and middle-tier candidates, who argued that the criteria forced them to concentrate on boosting donor contributions at the expense of retail politicking in the early voting states. And, some activists and party leaders in the early voting states have also criticized the DNC for winnowing the record field of candidates – which topped off at roughly two-dozen contenders this summer – before voters actually got to vote in the primaries and caucuses starting this coming February. ""The DNC is using polling to winnow the field even further, when it's voters and caucus-goers who should be determining our nominee,"" said Shannon Beckham, a spokeswoman for Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet's presidential campaign.  And, Galia Slayen, a spokeswoman for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, told Fox News that ""as the DNC continues to make the rules up as they go along, Governor Bullock will remain focused on bringing his message of a fair shot for every American directly to voters on the ground."" Both Bennet and Bullock were on the debate stage in July for the third round but failed to qualify for this month's showdown and it appears unlikely either will make the cut for October's debate. The new thresholds shouldn’t be much of a problem for many of the leading contenders – such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California, as well as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.  2020 DEMOCRATS FUME AT DNC OVER DEBATE THRESHOLDS Some of the other six candidates likely to make the October debate are not sure bets to qualify for November’s showdown. That group consists of Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang. As he has in the past, Yang praised the DNC,  tweeting,  ""Kudos to the DNC for raising the thresholds in a fair and transparent manner as well."" Some of the candidates, including Booker and Buttigieg, quickly used news of the new thresholds to reach out to supporters with fundraising emails. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro and billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer – who've also made the cut for October’s showdown – have yet to hit 3 percent in any polls since the November qualifying period kicked off earlier this month. And, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who's just one poll away from making the October debate, also has yet to reach 3 percent in any approved surveys. A new qualifying poll – a Monmouth University survey in New Hampshire – is set for release on Tuesday."
"'Fox News Sunday' anchor Chris Wallace reacts to Pelosi's formal impeachment inquiry announcement. ""Fox News Sunday"" anchor Chris Wallace weighed in on the formal impeachment inquiry being launched against  President Trump , insisting that the ongoing controversy surrounding his communications with Ukraine's leader puts ""a lot of meat on the bones"" of the process for House Democrats. ""I think that the most interesting aspect of this is, you know, we're talking a lot about what the whistleblower knew or didn't know firsthand ... but the fact is that President Trump and his staff have said quite a lot since Sunday in trying to explain or defend what they did that puts a lot of meat on the bones,"" Wallace told ""Special Report"" anchor Bret Baier. ""The fact is that the president says that in that introductory or in that congratulatory phone call with the president-elect at that time of Ukraine... He did talk about  Joe Biden  and his son and possible corruption and expressed some concerns about wanting the Ukrainian president to look into that."" Wallace then pointed to White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway's  remarks on ""Fox & Friends""  Tuesday morning confirming the report that Trump had asked Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to halt military aid to Ukraine prior to that July phone call. COMEY SAYS HE HOPES CONGRESS DOESN'T IMPEACH TRUMP: IT LETS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 'OFF THE HOOK' “Two parts of the basic story here -- that the president wanted Biden investigated, and that he had previously stopped aid that had been approved by Congress for Ukraine -- that those have been confirmed by the administration,"" Wallace continued. ""It may not bear fruit, but there is some meat on the bones here, both in terms of what the president said to the Ukrainian president and the actions that he had taken to stop aid before he made that call. So, there’s going to be something here for Congress to investigate. Whether it ends up rising to the levels of articles of impeachment, we don’t know.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"
"The genius of Barack Obama lay in the fact that Americans looked at him and could believe in almost anything. The left of the Democratic Party saw the revolutionary incarnation of hope, the promise of sweeping social change, and, in a black president, the overturning of America’s original sin. The center saw a measured  product of Harvard Law School,  a prudent reformer, a man of mixed identity and the middle ground.  Moderates were closer to the mark. Obama, a cool man, proved cautious to a fault. Still, the way he  cloaked  his coolness and masked his aloofness in the language of the heart was brilliant. This time around, there is no such political genius out there among the Democratic contenders.  The field appears to have narrowed to the occasionally befuddled and befuddling Joe Biden as the standard-bearer of moderation, and the nimble, plan-a-minute star of the campaign to date, Elizabeth Warren, with her progressive program of social and fiscal reform. Snapping at their heels, from a growing distance, is Bernie Sanders, with voice raised. His habitual dyspepsia has been sharpened by the way Warren steals his revolutionary thunder. No socialist, she; on the contrary,  Warren calls herself a “capitalist to my bones,”  but ready, unlike Biden, to tax the superrich who have skewed America’s promise. That’s her economic patriotism — a smart way to fight Donald Trump’s economic nationalism.  Some game-changer may yet come along. Biden could blow himself up with a shocking moment of incoherence or insult that goes beyond his known liabilities. He has already come close to that. He will be  more  exposed in the months ahead than he was as vice president at the no-drama White House. If the moderate Democratic ground opens up, the temptation for Michael Bloomberg to fill it may prove overwhelming, or, just possibly, another candidate — Kamala Harris, Cory Booker — will gain that elusive traction.  If Warren widens her lead over Sanders, will he withdraw in a way that might wrap it up for her? Railroaded out in 2016, when the Bernie-buzz was fresh, he will not, I suspect, be inclined to favors. Mr. Magnanimous he is not. Warren will have to fight it out. On the evidence, that will galvanize her. Biden is trying to bridge reassurance to the wealthy with outreach to energized progressives. That balancing act has maintained his lead in polls. If two Obama terms were not enough for you, he’s offering something resembling a third — Obamacare Plus;   a possible increase in capital-gains tax to address inequality.  Will this fine-tuning be enough in an agitated America, whiplashed by President Trump? I doubt it.  The under-30s, maybe under-40s, are underwhelmed by Biden , even angry that this honorable man has not chosen dignified retirement. He’s the emblem of the permanent political class, the one that  created  the conditions for Trump, in an era that Trump’s wild policy lurches and heresies and, yes, lies have now transformed. America’s restoration, after this trauma, will not be achieved by going back. What created Trump cannot oust Trump.   It will demand a new politics, and a new integrity, such as the one Warren has set out and embodied with greater vigor, persuasiveness and coherence than anyone else. Biden, on whom  Trump may have been seeking dirt in a July phone call  with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, can put an end to the president’s sullying of the Oval Office. He can’t, however, embody renewal. Is Warren too far left to win?   Maybe. Does she worry some purple-district Democrats who did well in 2018? Yes. But she can adjust. As for “electability,” an overused word, well, Trump won, and may again, so all bets are off. I said Biden has come close to a blowup moment. The campaign is grueling. You don’t have to be almost 77 to slip up. But he has demonstrated tone-deafness on race in a way that is disturbing. His reference to a  “record player” in the last Democratic debate  in the context of a question about reparations for slavery tied Biden to a bygone era, but that was far from the worst of it. Talking about black families — that is what the question was about — he actually said: “We bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It’s not that they don’t want to help. They don’t, they don’t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television — excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the, the — — make sure the kids hear words.” They don’t know what to do! Make sure the kids hear words ! This is insulting toward African-Americans. It’s of a piece with Biden’s comment (quickly adjusted) in August that “we have this notion that somehow if you’re poor, you cannot do it. Poor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids.” There’s a way, and a need, to talk about fundamental systemic racial injustice, but this is emphatically not it. Black does not equal poor and inept. The genius has left a void. Right now it’s not his vice president who may just fill it enough, but Warren.

"WASHINGTON — Everyone here is keyed up for the Big One. The One that’s going to finally bring Donald Trump down. As soon as the news  broke Wednesday night in The Washington Post  that a whistle-blower had accused the president of making some sort of nefarious “promise” during a call to a foreign leader, the hive erupted. Democrats haven’t been able to get Trump on paying off a porn star to protect his campaign. They haven’t been able to get him on being a Russian agent. They haven’t been able to get him on obstruction of justice. But maybe this time. Maybe this was the One where all would decide that they wanted impeachment, that the president’s behavior was so outrageous that they couldn’t imagine this sleazy business guy sitting in the Oval Office playing a tinpot dictator in a tinfoil hat for another second. Maybe this was the One that would finally move Republicans to turn on the Grendel who is terrorizing the village and gulping down their party. Certainly, Trump himself didn’t think so. As the capital was going into overdrive-freak-out mode Friday night trying to flesh out the whistle-blower story, the president was busy tweeting about a children’s book by a Fox News host: “Buy this Book — great for the kids!” If House Democrats can ever get their paws on the whistle-blower, maybe they can make up for the Judiciary Committee’s performance with Corey Lewandowski this past week, which left many wondering if these hearings designed to pry Trump out of office are just making Democrats look foolish. They certainly provide an ample platform for Trump loyalists to rail against their favorite deep state foils. When failed presidential candidate Eric Swalwell tried to get Lewandowski to read a message Trump had dictated to him, the witness nastily referred to the Democrat as “President Swalwell” and told him to read the message himself. The internecine strains between the impeach-now Nadler crowd and the get-him-out-in-2020 Pelosi crew grew more bitter.  Politico reported  that in a closed-door meeting, Speaker Nancy Pelosi shocked lawmakers and aides by harshly criticizing the House Judiciary Committee staffers for propelling the impeachment effort far beyond where the Democratic caucus stands. “And you can feel free to leak this,” Pelosi said acidly. In an  interview with NPR , she said she hadn’t changed her mind on impeachment, but she does think Congress should pass new laws so future presidents can be indicted. She said everyone had now seen what the founding fathers could not imagine: a president blatantly abusing the Constitution he has sworn to protect. Trump has certainly been working hard to prove Pelosi right that presidents should not ever be above the law. By Friday night, while Trump was readying for a state dinner with his ultraconservative  pal from down under , Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison,   The Wall Street Journal and The Times  were reporting  that the secret whistle-blower complaint involved this: President Trump repeatedly pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine — about eight times,  The Journal said  — to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s loony personal lawyer, to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. Giuliani has been pushing a story about the former vice president and his son, who had ties to a Ukrainian oligarch. After a fair bit of babbling on Chris Cuomo’s CNN show, Giuliani spit out some truth, that he asked the Ukrainians to look into the Bidens. Later  he tweeted : “A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.” Crooked Donald thinks he can create a crooked Joe narrative just like he created a Crooked Hillary one. Which is it, Donald: Crooked or Sleepy? So just consider this: Around the same time that Trump escaped the noose after Robert Mueller’s tepid testimony, sliding away from charges that he colluded with a foreign country to interfere in our election, he began arm-twisting another foreign country to interfere in our election. “Questions have emerged,”  The Times said , “about whether Mr. Trump’s push for an inquiry into the Bidens was behind a weekslong White House hold on military aid for Ukraine. The United States suspended the military aid to Ukraine in early July, according to a former American official.” So the president is under suspicion of making like Nixon and abusing power to go after his enemies, saying it would be a shame if anything happened to that military aid that you want because you don’t dig up some dirt on the son of my political rival. The administration kept the whistle-blower’s complaint from Congress, even though Congress has the legal authority to know what this urgent complaint is about. Pelosi issued an acerbic statement on Friday, noting that Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, was violating the law by refusing to disclose the complaint to Congress. “If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,” she said. Trump is literally acting like an international mobster.  Roy Cohn would be so proud . So is this the Big One? We don’t know because so much has come before. But if it is? Now that would be Big.

"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Democratic presidential candidate  Bernie Sanders  released a plan Saturday to eliminate  $81 billion in past-due medical debt , going a step beyond his primary rivals who have called for a government-run health insurance program. “In America today, it is unacceptable that one out of every six Americans have past-due medical bills on their credit report, totaling $81 billion,” Sen. Sanders, I-Vt.,  said in a statement , adding: ""It is immoral and unconscionable that families across the country are being evicted, having their heat disconnected, or having their already-inadequate wages garnished because of crippling medical debt while the health care industry made more than $100 billion in profits last year."" SUPREME COURT COULD HEAR GROUNDBREAKING CASE THAT CHALLENGES UN IMMUNITY   Under his plan, Sanders said, the federal government would step in for the individual to negotiate and pay off past-due medical bills in collections reported to credit agencies. Sanders also vowed to create a public credit registry to replace the three for-profit credit reporting agencies in order to, as he put it: “remove the profit motive from assessing the creditworthiness of American consumers.” He said the registry would use ""public, transparent algorithm to determine creditworthiness that eliminates racial biases in credit scores."" The self-described democratic socialist added that he would exclude medical debt from credit reports and end credit checking for rental housing, employment, insurance and other non-lending practices. BIDEN GOES ON THE ATTACK OVER UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, PLEDGES TO BEAT TRUMP 'LIKE A DRUM' Sanders made no mention in the proposal of how he planned to cover the $81 billion cost.  According to Reuters , the Sanders campaign has said they would pay for the debt elimination proposal through a tax on corporations based on their pay for chief executives. The details of that proposal have not been released. During an interview with Fox News Sept. 3, Sanders acknowledged that $81 billion is ""a lot of money,"" but he added, ""Compared to what? Compared to the $1.5 trillion that Trump gave in tax breaks to the one percent and large corporations. Compared to the billions of dollars that we spent bailing out the crooks on Wall Street 11 years ago. It is a lot of money but I think it’s the right thing to do.” Sanders was one of the earliest supporters of “Medicare-for-All,” which would replace job-based and individual health insurance with a government-run plan. Other top Democratic rivals have expressed interest in a toned-down version of Medicare-for-All. Sen.  Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass. has endorsed Sanders' plan but said there may be different ways to achieve coverage for all. Former Vice President  Joe Biden  has called to extend the Affordable Care Act by adding a public option. Sanders has also released a plan to eliminate $1.6 trillion in student loan debt while also making public college tuition-free. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As for where he draws the line in wiping out debt, Sanders in his Sept. 3 interview said ""there's a difference"" between wiping out medical debt and credit card debt. ""I don't believe we wipe out credit card debt. You want something, you pay for it.,"" he said. ""If you want to go out and buy a fancy house, you want to go out and buy a yacht, and you go in debt, hey that’s your decision…But I do believe we have to make a distinction. Getting cancer is not your decision. And I think we have a moral obligation to do everything we can to cancel that debt.”"
"Trump, while speaking with reporters before departing the White House for events in Texas and Ohio, continued to defend his July 25 call with  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , but said the 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate was discussed in the exchange. ""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption),"" Trump told reporters. CNN previously reported Trump pressed Zelensky   in the call to investigate  former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according  to a person familiar with the situation .  That call was also part of a  whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump previously branded criticism of the call a ""Ukranian Witch Hunt,"" while Biden accused the President of abusing his power to ""smear"" him. On Sunday, the President said he hopes officials release details of the call, but slammed the whistleblower responsible for filing a complaint. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a strong warning later Sunday to the Trump administration, which has refused to hand over the whistleblower complaint, saying it ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness"" if the resistance persists. The warning, shared in a letter to all House members, comes following a  refusal last week  by acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to turn over the complaint to Congress. In her letter, Pelosi, a California Democrat, said if the administration's refusals continue, it would constitute a ""serious possible breach of constitutional duties by"" Trump and would take Congress ""into a whole new stage of investigation.""  Pelosi set a deadline for Maguire to turn over the full whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee during  his scheduled appearance  Thursday. The Democratic leader's letter threatens investigation at a time when the White House is  already facing House inquiries on multiple fronts  and a continuing  impeachment investigation  by the House Judiciary Committee. The Trump administration has so far split on how to handle the details of the call, but any House-led investigation into the President's Ukraine contact could meet significant resistance from the White House, as it has stonewalled many of the congressional probes already in motion. Pressure to impeach Weighing in on the controversy earlier Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that impeachment ""may be the only remedy"" to Trump's refusal to make public the  complaint  and phone call transcript. ""If the President is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,"" the California Democrat told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" stopping short of  calling on Congress to immediately launch  proceedings. Schiff, who has  so far resisted joining other Democrats  in calling for impeachment, told Tapper he has been ""very reluctant"" to push for proceedings against the President because he sees it as a ""remedy of last resort,"" but also said Sunday that the President doesn't have the authority ""to engage in underhanded discussions."" The chairman's apparent edging toward impeachment follows pressure from others in his party -- including from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- to start proceedings. On Friday, Warren, who is vying for her party's presidential nomination, tweeted that ""Congress is complicit"" in failing to start impeachment proceedings against Trump after news broke that he had allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. Echoing Warren's sentiments, Ocasio-Cortez suggested in a tweet on Saturday that her party's ""refusal to impeach"" Trump was an even bigger scandal than what she said was the President's ""lawbreaking behavior."" Asked by Tapper Sunday about Trump keeping conversations with foreign leaders private, Schiff said: ""Well not if those conversations involve potential corruption or criminality or leverage being used for political advantage against our nation's interest.""  ""This would be, I think, the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during just about any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions,"" he said, adding that he's not certain that the call is the subject of the complaint.  White House split on releasing calls  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told reporters on Saturday that he didn't think Trump had tried pressuring Zelensky during the July call, but stopped short of saying the subject of Biden's son wasn't raised. The President on Sunday described his conversation with the Ukrainian president as ""warm and friendly"" and repeatedly urged reporters to look instead at Biden and Democrats, who he said -- without providing evidence -- have ""done some very bad things."" But while the President suggested he was open to releasing the conversation, telling reporters: ""I hope they can put it out,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there's no evidence such an action ""would be appropriate"" at this time. ""We don't release transcripts very often. It's the rare case,"" Pompeo said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn't be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances. There's no, there's no evidence that would be appropriate here at this point."" Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin also weighed in, telling Tapper Sunday that he thinks releasing the transcript ""would be a terrible precedent,"" arguing that ""conversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential.""  This story has been updated."
"Now, after a career built on demanding attention but evading meaningful scrutiny, Donald Trump is facing accountability for the first time in his life. Trump is struggling to respond to  revelations  that he pressured Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. And judging from his babbling public performance before reporters at the UN General Assembly in New York on Wednesday, he does not know how to cope. As usual, the President talked about a ""witch hunt"" and ""fake news"" and popularity polls as he spoke in the hoarse voice that seems to come over him in moments of stress. Then he damaged the case for his own defense, saying that if then-Vice President Joe Biden had sought a favor from Ukraine in 2015, it would have constituted an ""impeachable event.""  There's no proof that Biden sought favors from Ukraine. In fact the idea that he did is  refuted  in original reports on the matter. But a  rough White House transcript  of a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shows that the President did exactly what he'd suggested Biden had done. ""I would like you to do us a favor,"" Trump said to Zelensky, according to the White House  transcript  of the call. ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son. That Biden stopped the prosecutions and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. ... It sounds horrible to me."" If there's ""a lot of talk"" about Biden's son, it has been generated mainly by the President, his supporters and his personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Trump told Zelensky that both Attorney General William Barr and Giuliani would be calling the Ukrainian President. As Biden has long occupied the front-runner position in the Democratic primary, Trump has cause to fear him -- and to try to undermine him. But urging Ukraine to investigate Biden's son constitutes an abuse of the public trust.  Why would Trump use a phone call with a foreign leader to ask for a blatantly personal and political favor? I would suggest that Trump expects the government to function like his personal business -- and as a result he can't imagine that anything he might desire would be out of bounds for a president. Throughout his life, Trump has operated under special conditions that allowed him to get away with almost anything.  The classic example came when his extremely wealthy father  bailed out  his casino by purchasing $3.5 million worth of chips at a blackjack table and then left the casino without gambling. This gambit broke state regulations, but the resulting fine -- $30,000 -- was paltry, and the deposit provided much-needed cashflow. Family wealth bailed Trump out of other difficulties and made it possible for him to take risks that others would have avoided.  Bankruptcy followed bankruptcy , but because Trump's family money was protected by corporate structures, he maintained his high-profile lifestyle and kept on promoting himself as a super-successful businessman. He spread  lies  about the prominent women who had allegedly pursued him as a romantic partner, and he offered wildly varying claims about his personal wealth. Trump has even  said  that his net worth depends on how he feels at a given moment.  The truth about Trump remained elusive because so much of what he claimed could not be verified. His privately held businesses were not required to produce accurate public financial reports, and they never did. Meanwhile, how do you determine whether, as Trump  claimed , he had once been one of the best young baseball players in New York?  As his biographer, I put time into checking Trump's claims and discovered that many, like the one about his baseball prowess, were false. These lies didn't threaten the whole country when he was just the clown prince of New York real estate and a reality TV show host boasting, falsely, about his ratings. But now that Trump is President, all the bluster that may have seemed amusing and harmless to those who stayed outside Trump's orbit has plunged the nation into a constitutional crisis. What we've seen in just this one Trump scandal -- and there are many more -- suggests that the President is incapable of fulfilling his duties and may even be driven by self-destructive impulses.  As Trump  acknowledged  last week, a president's calls with foreign leaders are overheard by other US officials, who take notes. Given this knowledge, Trump's attempt to enlist Zelensky in his harebrained scheme was not just an abuse of public trust; it also demonstrates Trump's true beliefs about human nature. Who could be surprised that a national security official filed a whistleblower complaint about that phone call with Zelensky? Only a person who assumes that no one else ever acts out of a sense of ethical and moral duty. What Trump seems to have ignored is that the American President operates in a system designed to check abuses -- and that the government he heads might be filled with people of conscience. As this scandal unfolds, the administration will come to learn the meaning of accountability. For Trump personally, it will be the first time."

"According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump did not offer a quid pro quo to Volodymyr Zelensky during the July call; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports. As Congress and the White House wrestle over a whistleblower’s complaint against  President Trump , the story took a new turn late Friday when the  Wall Street Journal reported  that, in a July phone call, Trump “repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine” to investigate the dealings of Joe Biden’s family in Ukraine. Trump’s call is reportedly the source of a complaint by a whistleblower against the president that has sparked a furor among Democrats in Congress, who are demanding to see the complaint. If, as multiple news organizations are reporting, the whistleblower’s complaint centers on Ukraine, there is strong evidence that it relates to President Trump’s urging the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son. NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT The story behind that story is itself worthy of serious scrutiny. The proposed investigation involves Hunter Biden’s involvement with a controversial Ukrainian natural gas company while then-Vice President Biden was overseeing America’s Ukraine policy. Critics of the president have accused Trump of attempting to “extort” Ukrainian officials for “dirt” on Biden, the current front-runner for the Democratic nomination to run against Trump next year. But why would Ukraine have dirt on Joe Biden? For answers, one must look at Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company which, until earlier this year, employed Hunter Biden. In April 2014,  Hunter Biden agreed  to join Burisma’s board of directors, ostensibly to advise on legal issues, The New Yorker reported. Biden had no known expertise on the natural gas industry, but Burisma was certainly in need of help. Earlier that month, British officials  had frozen  the London bank accounts of Burisma’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, and soon after, Ukrainian officials opened their own  corruption investigation  into Burisma, the Kyiv Post in Ukraine reported. Hunter Biden helped to recruit a legal team for Burisma, including former Obama administration Justice Department official John Buretta and several American consulting firms, The  New York Times reported. The younger Biden was well compensated for his efforts. Records obtained by the Government Accountability Institute show he was paid as much as $83,333 per month for his work at Burisma. Hunter Biden claims he had no role in the investigation of the company, and that he never spoke about it with his father – but the facts show a troubling overlap with the Obama administration’s actions in Ukraine. On April 16, 2014, White House records show that Devon Archer, Hunter Biden’s business partner, made a private visit to the White House for a meeting with Vice President Biden. Five days later, on April 21, Joe Biden landed in Kiev for a series of high-level meetings with Ukrainian officials. Soon the United States and the International Monetary Fund would be pumping more than $1 billion into the Ukrainian economy, as  I wrote in the New York Post . CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The next day, there was a public announcement that Archer had been asked to join the board of Burisma. Three weeks after that, on May 13, it was officially announced that Hunter Biden would join, too. Like Hunter Biden, Archer had no background or experience in the energy sector. In March 2016, Ukrainian officials fired Viktor Shokin, the controversial prosecutor general whose office was overseeing the investigation into Burisma, The  New York Times reported . Six months later, the Burisma case was dropped entirely, the  Kyiv Post reported . According to Joe Biden himself, the former vice president played a key role in the prosecutor’s dismissal. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In March 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loans if Shokin was not fired, according to Biden, who recounted the exchange in  a 2018 speech : “I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b----. He got fired.” While the propriety of Trump’s call to the Ukrainian president is certainly questionable and worthy of inquiry, the investigation he was hoping for certainly seems warranted on its own merits.

"HOUSTON — A groan erupted at a  debate  watch party at Texas Southern University last week as former vice president  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  got a question about slavery and racism and  gave an answer about Venezuela and record players .  But amid that exasperation, some students channeled their inner Beltway operatives and began a targeted  rapid-response campaign.   Tyler Smith, 19, texted his grandmother after the debate, hopeful that Mr. Biden's meandering answer may have swayed her from supporting him.  Amaya St. Romain, 19, mounted a three-day lobbying blitz on her mother and her great-grandmother, making sure they had seen the former housing secretary  Julián Castro ’s criticisms of Mr. Biden onstage.  In  meme-speak ,  the efforts amounted to Killmonger, the villain in the Black Panther movie, challenging the people of Wakanda:  “Is this your king?”   “I think I’m definitely influencing them,” Ms. St. Romain said of her family members. “But my dad is definitely still pro-Biden. And I don’t really argue with him.”  If Mr. Biden,  76 , is going to win the  Democratic nomination , it is likely to be because of the  support of older black voters , a key constituency for the party  and one that polls show is overwhelmingly supportive of the former vice president’s candidacy .  But if he is to be overtaken by one of his more progressive rivals, the most powerful tool against him may not be opposition research or negative advertisements. Instead, it may be an organic effort by younger black voters — concerned about Mr. Biden’s age and more moderate ideology — to sway their older family members. Mr. Biden seems aware of this dynamic. In interviews, he has both acknowledged the generational gap among his black supporters and downplayed its importance,  arguing that the support of older, more moderate black voters  would be enough to give him an electoral advantage.  Still, Mr. Biden, by his own admission, would be unwise to underestimate the lobbying efforts of those who are young and politically engaged. At a gathering of the New Hampshire Young Democrats in July, Mr. Biden said the same phenomenon — young people converting their skeptical parents — had helped fuel his own ascension in politics almost 47 years ago, when he was elected to the Senate as a fresh-faced 29-year-old.  “The fact of the matter is, you have more influence on how your parents vote than they have on you,” Mr. Biden  said  in July. “You may sit at the dining room table, having dinner with your mom and dad, and say, ‘I met her and I really like her,’ or ‘I met him and I really like him.’ And your parents will pretend it didn’t matter much. But they’ll go up, not a joke, they’ll go up and say, ‘If my kid liked that person that much, and knew them, there must be something there.’”  At Texas Southern University, a historically black university founded in 1927 and the site of last week’s Democratic debate, dozens of students, ages 19 to 23, differed on their top candidate. Senators  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont,  Elizabeth Warren  of Massachusetts, and  Kamala Harris  of California were among the favorites, as was one of the two Texans in the race, former Representative  Beto O’Rourke .  For Mr. Biden, though, students carried mixed feelings. They respected his tenure as Barack Obama’s vice president, but implicitly rejected his campaign’s central premise, that the primary goal of Democrats in the 2020 election should be defeating President Trump.  They pointed to systemic problems they said the country must address, such as inequality, climate change and gun violence. The Democratic nominee, they said, should embrace progressive proposals like canceling student loan debt, the Green New Deal and gun buyback programs.  “Me and my dad have the debate all the time,” said Samantha Williams, 19, a sophomore. “We want a candidate that reflects us and what the world is going to look like when we run. But  he  says what we call ‘woke’ is really just sensitive.”  Jaylan Jones, 20, said, “Older people have that conservative outlook on things,” even older black Democrats.  “Young people don’t want Biden. We want Beto. We want Bernie,” said Ms. Jones, a junior. “I think we can convince them.”  The difference in opinion across generations speaks to the changing politics of black communities, said Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, the racial justice organization.  And the  historically diverse Democratic field  has given voters plentiful options to choose from: multiple black candidates, white progressives  who openly back once-radical ideas like reparations , and Mr. Biden, who served as vice president to the first black president.  Black voters are overwhelmingly members of the Democratic Party, and polls show they have long regarded Mr. Trump as a racist president and individual whom they are desperate to replace. A  recent national poll  of Democratic primary voters from NBC and The Wall Street Journal showed Mr. Biden had the support of nearly 50 percent with black respondents, though others have shown a less commanding lead. “Black people are strategic voters, particularly older black people,” Mr. Robinson said. “They’re thinking harm reduction. They’re doing a deep analysis about what they think white people will accept and won’t accept.” He pointed to the last Democratic primary, when younger black voters tracked more toward Mr. Sanders than their older counterparts, who overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton. In 2008, younger black voters supported Barack Obama in much bigger numbers than the electorate at large, until his victory in the Iowa Caucus led to a surge of support.  “Young people are constantly signaling what’s next and what’s possible,” Mr. Robinson said. “And while there’s some love for Biden, but sometimes you’re in a relationship because you’re comfortable and it’s what you know.”  Another Texas Southern student, Christopher Anwuri, 22, said the generational differences in how black voters saw the primary were fueled by opposing theories of political change: incrementalism versus immediate upheaval.  “This generation is looking for an instant, quick fix for problems,” he said. Older black people, meanwhile, think “these things need to take time.”  It also comes back to Mr. Obama, and  the long shadow he casts over national Democratic politics , particularly in black communities. Older black voters invoke his name in deference, and cite his embrace of  Mr. Biden  as something that helped him win the trust of skeptical white voters in 2008.  To younger generations, many of whom were in high school or younger at the time, Mr. Obama’s achievements exist on their own. Their first memories of Mr. Biden stem from his highly meme-able vice-presidential years. They are also more likely to hold his long and at times controversial record — on  criminal justice ,  school segregation  and the  Clarence Thomas hearings , among other things — against him.  Jayla Lee, 19, said older black voters “like Biden because he was with Obama, and they feel like since they could trust Obama that means they can trust him.”  “But the things we endure are not the things they endured,” Ms. Lee said. “And I’m looking for someone who can change the things that affect me.”  Darren Black, 22, said older generations were always “going to ride” for Mr. Biden, because “Joe was there with Obama.”  “But the younger generation, we've seen mass shootings, we’re seeing more police brutality — we’re looking at different things,” Mr. Black said.  Yet contrary to their stereotype as idealistic and apathetic, and with the steely pessimism of seasoned political operatives, younger voters expressed a cleareyed understanding that their efforts to lobby their relatives would not necessarily be successful.  Asked if she’d had any luck converting her family to more progressive candidates, Ms. Williams, a political science major, said, “I’m making no progress. None. Not even a tiny bit. I wish.” Ms. Williams called her pro-Biden father a lost cause. “We’re both opinionated and headstrong people, a nd I just don’t have the energy to go back and forth,” she said.  Mr. Smith, a member of the school’s College Democrats, said he liked Mr. Biden, but preferred his more left-wing rivals, such as Mr. O’Rourke, Mr. Castro, Ms. Harris or Ms. Warren.  After the debate, he thought about further pestering his grandmother over her support for Mr. Biden, but he reconsidered out of fear of coming off as pushy.  “You know, it’s grandma, so you got to let her have it,” Mr. Smith said.  When reached by phone, however, Mr. Smith’s grandmother, Alice Varnado, said his previous lobbying efforts had been more successful than he may have realized.  Ms. Varnado, 69, said she still preferred Mr. Biden, but that she had grown concerned about his age in recent months. She said she would vote for whichever Democrat earned the nomination, but she now considers Ms. Warren her second choice.  Her family members — Mr. Smith and his uncle — had convinced her. “You know, since talking with my grandson and my son, I think I can go with her,” said Ms. Varnado. “I’m starting to like her. There’s been a turning point.”  Katie Glueck contributed reporting."
"And you would be wrong! ""It is regrettable that House Intelligence Committee Chairman (Adam) Schiff and Senator (Chuck) Schumer have chosen to politicize the issue,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said from the floor of the Senate on Monday, adding that the ""specific subject"" of the whistleblower complaint filed to to the intelligence community inspector general remains unknown. (It doesn't. Trump has made clear that a) he talked to the Ukrainian President and b) mentioned on that call the idea that Biden and his son, Hunter, might be involved in corrupt activity in the country.) Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who was once seen as a rare Republican willing to question Trump, had this to say when  asked by Vice's Liz Landers  if he had a comment on the Trump/Ukraine news: ""You're welcome to talk to James in my office."" And Texas Sen. John Cornyn had  this to say about the whistleblower : ""I am a little troubled that apparently some of the initial reports came form somebody that didn't have firsthand knowledge, and then it sort of took off like a wildfire."" So, yeah. The reason that questions about Trump's behavior throughout this Ukraine drama won't be the final straw in the Republican relationship with Trump is because there will never be a final straw in Republicans' relationship with Trump. When he won the GOP nomination, the vast, vast, vast majority of GOPers simply decided that even though they didn't support him initially and still had LOTS of questions about how he went about things, Trump was channeling their base and the only way to stay alive politically was to support him without question. Which is what they have done. Through the Mueller report and its double-digit instances of obstructive behavior by the President. Through his calls for four non-white Democratic congresswomen to ""go back"" where they came from. (Three of the four were born in the United States). And now through this. And to be clear, here's what we know this is -- based on what Trump has already said he did: The sitting President of the United States floated the idea that the 2020 Democratic frontrunner was doing something nefarious to a world leader and may have urged said world leader to investigate. (Here's what Trump said Monday afternoon at the UN General Assembly meetings in New York City: ""There was no pressure put on them whatsoever. I put no pressure on them whatsoever. I could have. I think it probably, possibly would have been OK if I did."") Regardless of whether there was a specific ask for an investigation or some kind of quid pro quo offered by Trump -- The Washington Post has reported there was a ""promise"" made between Trump and the Ukrainian President -- this is already the sort of stuff that any Republican should be willing to criticize the President about. After all, even if Trump didn't offer a quid pro quo, he quite clearly was aware of the power imbalance between the two nations and the fact that Ukraine would be eager to please the US. That's not to say that every Republican should come out for impeaching Trump today. Far from it. But, it is to say that the unwillingness to criticize behavior that is clearly un-presidential (at best) reeks of the bargain the party made with itself when Trump won: Winning matters more than anything and everything else. The Point : The silence from Republicans is deafening. Again."
"Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett says Nancy Pelosi's formal impeachment inquiry is nothing more than a gesture until she brings it to the House floor for a vote. House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi  on Tuesday endorsed an official inquiry to impeach President Trump, and there is joy across Resistance America—at least for now. The decision guarantees that this will go down as the Impeachment Congress, with little to show beyond investigations into the Trump campaign and now the Trump Presidency. In one sense this moment was probably inevitable. Most  Democrats  and most of the media have never accepted Mr. Trump as a legitimate President. They can’t believe 63 million Americans voted for him over their nominee, Hillary Clinton, so they have looked every day since Election Night in 2016 for some reason to expel him from office.

Then they hyped obstruction of justice because Mr. Trump fired James Comey as FBI director, but the public wasn’t persuaded.

Mr. Trump also admits that he delayed U.S. aid to Ukraine in early July prior to the phone call out of concern for corruption and allied burden sharing."
"President Donald Trump made 79 false claims last week, mixing some fresh false accusations and pointlessly false anecdotes into his usual stew of repeat favorites. Seventy-nine false claims is down from  90 the week prior to last , Trump's highest total since we started counting at CNN on July 8, but it was still his fourth-most-dishonest of these 11 weeks. His weekly average since July 8 is now 59 false claims. Trump made 29 of last week's 79 false claims at his campaign rally in New Mexico. He made 13 more in his White House meeting and press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, seven on Twitter. The rest came in a smattering of events, interviews and exchanges with reporters. Twenty-seven of the false claims were about the economy, 15 about Democrats. The most egregious false claim: The Ukraine delay Facing difficult questions about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump and his allies have tested out a variety of possible explanations. At one point last week, though, Trump decided to just deny the very existence of the delay. ""I didn't delay anything,"" he  told reporters .  ""We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge."" The money was paid, but that payment very clearly came after a delay. By this week, Trump was  openly defending the delay  he had said did not happen. ""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine, because they're not doing it,"" he said -- which is also not true. The most revealing false claim: Maligning Omar, again Trump has made a concerted effort to smear Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of the  first two Muslim women elected to Congress . Last week's  entirely baseless inflammatory allegation  was his third in under three months. This time, Trump amplified a tweet from a conservative commentator, Terrence K. Williams. Posting a video of Omar dancing, Williams accused her of partying on the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The  footage was from September 13 . The President either didn't check, didn't care, or both. The most absurd false claim: The name of the Democratic Party For sheer weirdness, it is hard to top Trump's  story  about the mountain climbers and the border wall. But we say his claim about the Democratic Party did it. Some of Trump's false claims are so bizarre that it's almost embarrassing to check them. When you do, some of his supporters will inevitably accuse you of humorlessness or pettiness. Whatever: this is a comprehensive tally, and we must do our solemn duty. Thus, we must point out that ... the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party. We must do so because Trump has repeatedly and solemnly insisted that the actual name is the ""Democrat Party."" He  said  last week, again, that he is not only using ""Democrat Party"" because it sounds worse but because that is the party's official name. He urged the Democrats to make a change to the nicer ""Democratic Party,"" in which case he might call them that. Yes, he might just be trolling. No, that does not make any of this less confusing. Here is a list of false claims from last week that we had not previously fact checked in a weekly update: Google and the 2016 election ""Did you see Google? He said I may have lost 2 million to 10 million votes according to this character that worked at Google, right? And we still won. How the hell did we win? Everybody was against us. How did we win? How did we win? This is a Google executive.

It was beyond an offer. It was something where he said, 'I'm not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor.' And they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour. And the prosecutor was prosecuting the company of the son and the son."" -- September 22  exchange with reporters  after Coast Guard briefing in Houston  Facts First :  There is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation. The investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors since 2014. The United Kingdom had begun investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board.

Joe Biden and ""the case""  ""Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. So, somebody ought to look into that."" -- September 20  exchange  with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison  Facts First :  There is no evidence that Biden ever called on Ukraine to remove its chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, from a case involving Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of a natural gas company on whose board of directors Biden's son Hunter Biden sat. Rather, Biden, like the US government more broadly and several US allies, tried to get Shokin fired. Trump's allies might argue that calling for a prosecutor's firing was even worse than calling for him to be taken off a particular case. But there is a key difference given the context. Had Biden called for Shokin to be taken off a particular matter in which his son had a stake, this would seem to suggest that his motivation was helping his son. But Biden calling for Shokin's firing, without mentioning that particular case, was consistent with the international concern about Shokin's performance.

And then he said he never spoke to this son. Does anybody believe that one? But then he also said, long before, that that he did speak to his son. So he lied, again."" And: ""I mean, give me a break, he's already said he spoke to his son. And now he said, yesterday, very firmly. Who wouldn't speak to your son? Of course, you spoke to your son. So, he made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son. He spoke to his son."" -- September 22  exchange  with reporters before Marine One departure  Facts First :  Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker  article  in July. That article said this: ""As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: 'Dad said, ""I hope you know what you are doing,"" and I said, ""I do.'"" Once is more than never, so Trump can fairly point out the contradiction -- though the New Yorker article did not offer evidence that the father-son exchange was detailed.

Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional."" -- September 17  exchange  with reporters on Air Force One  Facts First :  Trump had met Roberts, who  died  on September 17. As CNN's Brian Stelter  noted , she  interviewed him  at Trump Tower for a story that aired on ABC in December 1999. (Roberts also questioned him by phone during the 2016 campaign; she  asked  him asked about children using his campaign rhetoric to bully other children. He called the question ""very nasty."")   Trump, who has been interviewed many hundreds of times, could well have just forgotten the 1999 meeting, but his statement was false regardless of his intent. San Francisco, the ocean and needles ""We'll start with those two cities and we're looking at San Francisco, we're looking at Los Angeles. And we're looking at all of the things that are happening. You know, there's tremendous pollution being put into the ocean, because they're going through what's called a storm sewer. That's for rainwater. And we have tremendous things that we don't have to discuss pouring into the ocean. There are needles, there are other things. Lot of bad -- lot of -- it's a terrible situation. That's in Los Angeles and in San Francisco. And we're going to be giving San Francisco -- they're in total violation -- we're going to be giving them the notice very soon."" -- September 18  exchange  with reporters on Air Force One  Facts First :  There is no evidence for Trump's claim that San Francisco has significant pollution, including needles, being sent into the ocean through storm sewers. San Francisco Mayor London Breed  called  Trump's claims ""ridiculous,"" saying in a statement that the city's sewer system ""ensures that all debris that flow into storm drains are filtered out at the city's wastewater treatment plants."" David Lewis, executive director of nonprofit Save the Bay,  told  the Mercury News: ""In San Francisco, all solids in that stormwater and sewage water are removed. And what comes out of the plant is sometimes cleaner than the water that many people in this state are drinking.""  The San Francisco Chronicle  reported : ""Storm drain runoff is piped to one of two city treatment facilities, the Southeast Treatment Plant in the Bayview neighborhood or the Oceanside Treatment Plant near the zoo. Any pollutants would be treated at those points if they haven't already been filtered out at catch basins beneath city streets, according to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. 'We haven't had any (recent) problems with syringes,' said SFPUC spokesman Tyler Gamble.""  Mountain climbers and the wall ""We actually built prototypes and we have, I guess you could say, world-class mountain climbers. We got climbers. We had 20 mountain climbers. That's all they do; they love to climb mountains. They can have it. Me, I don't want to climb mountains. But they're very good. And some of them were champions. And we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb."" -- September 18  exchange  with reporters during border visit  Facts First :  There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast  contacted  several top mountain climbers and governing body USA Climbing, nobody had any idea what Trump was talking about. Customs and Border Protection refused to comment to CNN, referring questions to the White House. The wall and San Diego ""You know in San Diego, California, is very difficult, always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego -- good mayor in San Diego, by the way. They wanted a wall, and I said, 'You know what, let's build it someplace else, because California, you know, once we build it, they'll complain.'"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we  reported  at the Toronto Star, there is no basis for Trump's repeated suggestion that the city itself wanted a wall. San Diego's city council  voted  5-3 in 2017 to express opposition to the proposal, and even the Republican mayor Trump was praising here, Kevin Faulconer, has  made clear  that he is  opposed .  The name of the Democratic Party Trump said he calls the Democratic Party the ""Democrat Party"" not only because ""Democrat"" sounds worse than ""Democratic"" but because ""that's their name, the Democrat Party""; he said, ""Frankly, they should probably change it  -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First : The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly  insisted  that the actual name is the Democrat Party, so we are not going to let it slide. A tweet on Ilhan Omar Trump shared a tweet from comedian and conservative commentator Terrence K. Williams, who alleged that Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was dancing on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In his own comment above Williams' tweet, which Williams later deleted, Trump  wrote , ""IIhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party!"" -- September 18 tweet  Facts First :  The footage of Omar dancing was from September 13, 2019, not the anniversary of September 11. She was attending an event, called Breaking Concrete Ceilings, connected to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference.  You can read a full fact check on the tweets  here .  Nuclear weapons ""Our nuclear was getting very tired. They hadn't spent the money on it. And now we have it have it in, as we would say, 'tippy-top shape.' Tippy-top. It's — we have new and we have renovated and it's — it's incredible."" --September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison  ""As you know, we've spent tremendous and hopefully -- and we pray to God we never have to use it, but we've totally renovated and bought new nuclear. And the rest of our military is all brand new. The nuclear now is at a level that's it's never been before."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison Facts First : ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to  cost more than $1 trillion . And experts say that Trump has not yet implemented significant changes to the arsenal. ""I feel comfortable saying that the scientific studies to date have yet to provide any evidence that the nuclear arsenal was 'tired' or in any way at risk of being ineffective if called upon,"" said Scott Kemp, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy.   ""I am not aware that Trump can claim to have done anything for the state of the nuclear arsenal — but nothing urgent needed to be done anyway,"" said Kemp, who served as a State Department adviser on arms control early in the Obama administration. Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation, said that, with the exception of a hypothetical top-secret development she doesn't know about, ""everything is the same"" in the deployed arsenal ""as it was in January 2017"" -- aside from reductions the US made to fulfill its obligations under the New START treaty with Russia. While ""the Trump administration has certainly requested and received increased funding for nuclear modernization,"" Bell said, ""this is a trajectory we have been on since  2010 "" -- and ""he hasn't really changed anything yet."" ""Budgets clearly demonstrate that we have spent enormous of money on nuclear modernization over the past decade,"" said Bell, who served in the State Department under Obama from 2010 to 2017.  A wall at the Democratic convention? Talking about the large barriers he had visited at a California border site and is planning to erect elsewhere, Trump was asked if that's what he wants around the White House grounds. He said, ""No, but that's what the Democrats are putting up around their convention...They're building a big wall around their convention. Which they should do."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One  ""You know what I saw the other day? Where the Democrats are having their convention, their national convention. They just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what it's for? They're building a big wall around the building, they're building a big wall, a massive wall."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  There is no evidence that the Democrats are planning to erect a big wall around the convention site. ""It's not true,"" Democratic National Committee spokesman Brandon Gassaway told CNN. There will likely be some sort of security fencing in the vicinity of the convention, as is standard, but there are no known plans for a wall even slightly resembling the steel-and-concrete structure Trump visited in California. The Green New Deal and cars Trump said that, under the Democrats' Green New Deal proposal, people would be limited to one car: ""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips. A single car. Make it electric -- single car, you're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  The congressional  resolution  on the Green New Deal does not include any restrictions on the number of cars people could own or the number of miles they could drive.  The proposal calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail."" Bay of Pigs veterans ""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%. They gave me the Bay of Pigs award. Can you imagine, right? The Bay of Pigs award."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The  endorsement  was the first the association had ever made in a presidential election, so Trump could fairly boast about it. But still, an award and an endorsement are different things. (Trump claimed in August to have received an award from the Log Cabin Republicans, which told CNN it gave him an endorsement but not an award.) Trump's Cuban American support in 2016 ""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%..."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses  reported on by the Miami Herald  when Trump claimed in 2017 that he had received ""84%"" of the Cuban-American vote. The Herald noted that estimates range from 50% to 58%. The Herald reported: ""Mauricio Claver-Carone, former executive director of the US-Cuba Democracy PAC who was appointed by Trump to the Treasury Department, estimated that Trump won 58% of the Cuban-American vote based on his review of results from about 30 Miami-Dade precincts with large Cuban-American populations."" As the Herald reported, University of Florida professor Daniel A. Smith found that Trump's best performance with Cuban-American voters in any Miami-Dade precinct was 68%. Military aid to Ukraine Question: ""How do you explain the military aid, sir? How do you explain delaying military aid (inaudible)?"" Trump: ""Because I want Germany and I want France and I want the European Union to put up money. And I didn't delay anything. We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure Facts First :  Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine.  CNN , the  Washington Post  and the  New York Times  reported that Trump himself ordered the hold on the aid. Trump was correct that the aid was eventually paid, but he was incorrect when he denied the very existence of a delay; the delay has been publicly discussed  by members of Congress  and by  people who were serving in the Ukrainian government  this summer. The Post reported that although the Trump administration notified congressional officials in February and in May that portions of the aid was going to be released, but the release didn't actually happen until September.   The estate tax ""And to keep New Mexico's farms, ranches and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but  did not get rid of the tax entirely .  It's also misleading to suggest that the estate tax had been a particular burden on farms and small businesses; very few of them were paying the tax even before Trump's changes came into effect. According to the Tax Policy Center, a mere 50 farms and closely held businesses were among the 5,190 estates to pay the estate tax in 2017, before Trump's tax law. The Center  wrote  on its website: ""The Tax Policy Center estimates that small farms and businesses will pay $20 million in estate tax in 2017, one-tenth of 1 percentage of the total estate tax revenue.""  Oil prices ""Our country is doing well. You look at so many different things.  Look at all of the regulation cutting that allows us to do what we did. Look at what happened three days ago — where you have an attack like that and it takes out a big chunk of oil, and the prices go up $4, $5, and now it's heading down rapidly. That tells you — that would have happened years ago, it would have gone up $50. It would've doubled. And this was a blip."" -- September 20  press conference  with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison  Facts First :  Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5:  Brent crude futures , the international benchmark, and  West Texas Intermediate futures  both rose more than $8, about 15% each, between the close of trading on Friday, before the attack, and the close of trading on Monday; it was the largest single-day percentage gain for Brent since at least 1988, Reuters  reported . We can't fact check Trump's hypothetical about what might have happened to oil prices if the attack had occurred some unspecified number of years ago. The cost of the Mueller investigation ""House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent..."" -- September 16  tweet   ""...they spent $40 million -- there's not a person in the room that I couldn't find something on with that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico  Facts First :  The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to  figures  released by the Justice Department -- and the government is expected recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller. The vast majority of this $17 million is expected to come from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was ordered to forfeit assets and pay millions to the Internal Revenue Service.  Here's a list of claims we've fact checked before in one of our weekly updates: Immigration Mexican troops on the border ""And I want to thank the President of Mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. It's been incredible what's taken place in a short period of time."" -- September 22  speech  at Howdy, Modi event in Houston  Facts First: The approximately 26,000 troops are split between the US border and Mexico's southern border. Trump himself said in late July that 6,000 of the troops were near Guatemala; speaking to the press in September, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan  said , ""Since June, Mexico has deployed thousands of troops. They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the norther border with the United States."" Mexico's immigration assistance ""You know, Mexico has never done anything to impede people from pouring into our country, and now they're doing just the opposite.  They've really been incredible."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit  Facts First :  Mexico also took action to impede migrants from entering the United States during the Obama administration. Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, noted that the Mexican government beefed up its border enforcement measures as part of a cooperation program with the US that aimed to address the 2014 surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America. ""The numbers of unaccompanied minors dropped as a result of this cooperation (and the two countries dealt with a second, smaller spike in 2016 the same way),"" Selee said. He added: ""The Mexican government has actually deported more Central Americans to their home countries since 2015 than the US government has, sharply limiting the number of migrants from that region that have made it to the US border."" Building the wall   ""Well, this section is 14 (miles), but we're building many that are 50 and 40 and 17 and different areas. We're building on many different sites all up and down along the border."" -- September 18  interview  with Fox News' Ed Henry  ""Well, you know we're building the wall and it's going up and it's going up fast."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico ""Now, the wall still, obviously, has a ways to go, but we're building it at a breakneck speed."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit  Facts Firs t:  Trump was exaggerating the pace of border-barrier construction. No new miles of border wall had been built during Trump's presidency as of August, Customs and Border Protection told CNN's Geneva Sands. Sixty miles of existing barriers had been replaced over Trump's tenure in office, but Trump was incorrect that there are ""many"" sections of 50, 40 and 17 miles under construction. Democrats and the border Trump said the Democrats have an agenda of ""open borders.""  -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  Even Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests. Human trafficking ""If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic? And they traffic really for the most part in women, that's what they traffic in, it's women. They're not trafficking in men, they capture women and they bring them across the open borders and they don't go through ports of entry where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else. They go out into the desert areas and they hang a left or they hang a right and they come in."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  Many human trafficking victims do indeed come through ports of entry, according to US experts on trafficking and according to international data. Experts say that victims are more likely to be deceived into crossing the border willingly than kidnapped and put in the back of a vehicle. ""I have worked on human trafficking on multiple continents in multiple countries for more than two decades, and in all the work that I've done with trafficking victims, I have met one who was actually kidnapped and thrown into a car,"" Martina Vandenberg of the Human Trafficking Legal Center told CNN in January, when Trump was telling frequent stories about women being bound and gagged in cars. Many victims, experts say, are tricked into coming to the US with promises of a good job. Others are coerced through threats to their families or themselves. While experts say there may be some cases like the ones Trump has described, they emphasize that such cases are in a small minority. In 2018, the UN International Organization for Migration  found  that ""in the last 10 years, almost 80% of journeys undertaken by victims trafficked internationally cross through official border points, such as airports and land border control points.""   Democrats The Green New Deal, cows and planes ""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue)  all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  The Democrats' Green New Deal environmental resolution does not call for the elimination of cows or planes. Trump did not make up this claim out of thin air. A ""FAQ""  page  that once appeared on the website of a leading Green New Deal proponent, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls for the government to ""build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary."" In explaining why Green New Deal proponents were aiming to get to ""net-zero"" carbon emissions in 10 years rather than the more ambitious goal of zero carbon emissions at all, the FAQ said, ""We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.""  The FAQ was not an official party document and has not been broadly adopted by Green New Deal supporters. Its language about cows and planes does not appear in the text of the Green New Deal resolution many congressional Democrats have endorsed. The  resolution  calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector"" and ""working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible. Popularity and accomplishments Special election in North Carolina's 9th District Trump said North Carolina congressional candidate Dan Bishop, who won a September special election, was down ""17 points three weeks ago,"" before Trump got involved. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  Bishop was not down 17 points in any  public poll , though some did have him trailing by single-digit margins. When we tweeted about this, Matt Wolking, deputy director of communications for the Trump campaign, responded ""Try harder"" -- pointing to a  tweet  by Jim Blaine, a Republican strategist, that included an apparent poll excerpt that showed Bishop down 14. But 14 is not 17. And neither Wolking nor Blaine responded to our questions about who conducted the poll, who it was conducted for, when it was conducted, what its methodology was, or what its sample size was; Blaine's tweet did not include any of that information. Special election in North Carolina's 3rd District Trump said Greg Murphy, who won the special election in North Carolina's 3rd District, ""was up a couple of points"" before his victory. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One  late poll  had him up by 11 points. The poll was in line with pundits' expectations for the race, which was widely seen to be an easy Republican victory. Murphy was running in a district formerly held by the late Republican Rep. Walter Jones, who ran unopposed by the Democrats in the 2018 election; and Trump won the district by about 24 points in 2016.  Trump could have fairly said Murphy outperformed the polls, since he won by 24 points, but ""a couple of points"" is incorrect. Suppression polls ""Now, if it's close, like it's in play, you know you wait two three four or five hours to see what it is, but they don't even take a breath because they're called suppression polls, and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people say. They're no different. They're suppression polls."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  There is simply no evidence that pollsters have manipulated their numbers to suppress the enthusiasm of Trump voters, as Trump has repeatedly alleged. Veterans Choice Trump boasted that he was the one who got the Veterans Choice health care Trump passed, saying, ""They've tried to get that for 45 years. They haven't been able to get it. But I'm good at getting things."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was  signed  into law by Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program. Foreign and military affairs Venezuela's wealth ""Look at Venezuela: Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and today very sad, no food, no water, no nothing."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  Venezuela was not one of the world's wealthiest countries 15 years ago. The International Monetary Fund ranked Venezuela 67th in the world in 2004 by GDP per capita, at $4,019 (US) -- better than more than half of the world's countries, but nowhere near the top. ""Venezuela was one of the richest countries in the world 60 years ago. The richest in Latin America 40 years ago. But not 20 years ago,"" Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister and central bank board member, said in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. Hausmann, now a Harvard University professor of economic development, was chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank from 1994 to 2000. The war in Afghanistan ""We have hit — in Afghanistan, we have hit the Taliban harder than they've ever been hit in the entire 19 years of war."" -- September 20  exchange  with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison  Facts First :  We'll ignore Trump's subjective claim about how ""hard"" the US is attacking the Taliban. ""Nineteen years of war,"" though, was a small exaggeration. The US invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, nearly 18 years ago. This was not a one-time slip though; Trump habitually says ""19 years."" The Iran nuclear deal ""The problem was, the deal that was signed by the previous administration was a disaster — which, by the way, would be expiring in a very short period of time also. So you really don't have a deal.  You know, that deal was a very short-term deal. So they made a deal, but it was for a very short period of time. So that deal would be expiring very soon."" -- September 16  exchange with reporters  with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain  Facts First :  Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check  here .  ISIS fighters and Europe ""We have thousands of ISIS fighters and we want those fighters to be taken -- you're talking about, I think it's a big -- we have thousands of ISIS fighters that we've taken into -- we've defeated 100% of the caliphate. We are holding in various forms of prison. We're holding thousands of people. Many come from Germany, many come from France, many come from Holland -- really most of them come from various European countries. And we want them to take them back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One   ""They mostly come out of Europe."" -- September 20  exchange  with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison  Facts First:   According to Trump's own government estimates, a minority of ISIS fighters being held in Syria came from Europe . James Jeffrey, Trump's special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition,  said  August 1 that about 8,000 of 10,000 terrorist fighters who were then prisoners in northeastern Syria were Iraqi or Syrian nationals; there were ""about 2,000 ISIS foreign fighters"" from all other countries.  Trump himself  tweeted  in February to ask that European countries take back ""over 800"" ISIS fighters captured in Syria.  Remains from North Korea ""We've gotten our hostages back. We've gotten our great soldiers back who were killed — many of them. And many more are coming back.  We have many more coming back. And the families of those — we call them 'our heroes.' And they were our heroes. And they're coming back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit  Facts First :  While North Korea returned some remains last year, it is no longer doing so. The US military announced in May that the remains program had been suspended for the rest of the 2019 fiscal year because North Korea had stopped communicating with the US agency responsible for the effort. Trump could accurately tout the return of remains in the past tense: North Korea returned 55 cases of possible remains in the summer of 2018. But the remains are no longer being returned. You can read a longer fact check of this claim  here . Trade Unions and the USMCA  Trump said of his USMCA trade agreement, ""Unions love it."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation  says  it will be a ""disaster for workers"" if it is not amended. As The New York Times has reported, the United Automobile Workers and United Steelworkers, among other unions, have also demanded changes. Trade deficit with China Trump said the trade deficit with China was $500 billion, alleging that previous presidents allowed China to ""to take out $500 billion a year"" or even ""more than that"" including theft of intellectual property. -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison Facts First :  Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was  $381 billion last year  when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone. Aid to farmers Talking about his tariffs on China, Trump said, ""And I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted, and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison  Facts First :  It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a  second announcement  that followed an earlier $12 billion announcement. The China-specific tariffs have generated a total of about $30 billion, according to the US government's tracking  data  as of September 24.  Who is paying for Trump's tariffs on China Trump said twice that China is ""eating the tariffs"" he has imposed on imports of Chinese products, and he said on a third occasion that the government was taking in the tariff revenue ""from China.""  Facts First :  A bevy of  economic   studies  has found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments. China's economic performance Trump said four times that China is having its worst economic year in ""57 years."" Facts First :  China's second-quarter growth rate was the  worst in 27 years . Trump has repeatedly  made clear  that he knows that this is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason. History of the tariffs On three occasions on which eh talked about tariff revenue, Trump said the US has never previously received ""10 cents,"" ""100 cents"" or ""billions"" from China. Facts First :  The US government has been charging tariffs on imported Chinese goods for more than two centuries, and it took in billions from such tariffs long before Trump imposed his own tariffs. (As always, we'll note it is US importers and consumers, not China, who have paid these tariffs.) The Treasury received $14 billion from tariffs on China  in 2014 , to look at one pre-Trump year. Economy and energy Automotive investments  ""My relationship has been very powerful with the autoworkers — not necessarily the top person or two, but the people that work doing automobiles. Nobody has ever brought more companies into the United States. You know, I have Japan and Germany, and many countries have been bringing car companies in and opening plants and expanding plants. "" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain  Facts First :  Contrary to Trump's claims, there has been no boom in investment from Japanese, German, or other foreign automakers during his tenure. From Trump's inauguration through July, the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit that studies the industry, found 66 automaker announcements of new US manufacturing facilities, or expansions or updates to existing facilities. The center found 170 such announcements in Obama's (four-year) first term, 154 in Obama's second term, according to the center's Bernard Swiecki. Just two Japanese car companies, Toyota and Mazda, have announced plans to build a US plant (together) during Trump's presidency; their joint venture is under construction in Alabama. There is no evidence Trump was personally responsible for this investment decision. Trump has said since 2018 that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told him that more Japanese carmakers will soon announce major US investments. But none of these companies has announced a new US plant since Toyota and Mazda introduced the joint venture in early 2018, though Japanese automakers have made additional investments in existing facilities and Japanese truck company Hino Motors has built a truck-cab assembly plant in West Virginia. ""We know of no German or Japanese automakers currently looking to place additional car or truck assembly capacity in the United States,"" said Kristin Dziczek, the center's vice president of industry, labor and economics. Energy independence ""Well, we have the Strategic — if you look at what we have, we have tremendous amounts of oil in our country. We're independent of everybody now."" -- September 16  exchange  with reporters  ""So nice that our Country is now Energy Independent. The USA is in better shape than ever before."" -- September 18  tweet   ""We're independent, as independent as we want, and we are now a net exporter of energy"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is  expected  to export more energy than it imports by 2020, according to the government's Energy Information Administration, but that has not happened yet.  In the first five months of 2019, PolitiFact  noted , the US also consumed more energy than it produced.  There have been occasional, brief  periods  where US exports have exceed imports or  where  its production has exceeded consumption, but this hasn't happened for a full recent year. ""The US is still a net importer of crude and refined products, although the trend of declining dependence on imports should continue due to increased domestic production of unconventional oil and biofuels and growing investment in export infrastructure following the 2015 repeal of the crude export ban,"" said Josh Price, a senior analyst for energy and utilities at Height Capital Markets. ""Most of these factors preceded President Trump and have not been significantly altered by administration policies."" The decrease in US imports and increase in exports began before the Trump administration. Obama presided over a  boom  in liquefied natural gas exports and signed a bill lifting a 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports. ""The truth is that both of the presidents of this decade (President Obama and President Trump) have presided over an incredibly brisk expansion of our capacity to produce oil and refined products. Executive policy has had little to do with the explosive gains, which are attributable to technology and price,"" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service. It's worth noting that the US will still be using large quantities of foreign energy even if it does become a net exporter next year. In other words, it will not be completely independent from foreign suppliers. Energy production Trump claimed four times that the US had only recently become the world's largest producer of oil and gas; in one of the claims, he added a message of self-congratulation in the third person: ""Thank you, Mr. President!"" Facts First :  The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot  in 2012 , under Obama, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration. The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure. ""The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's,"" the Energy Information Administration  says .  Asian American unemployment Facts First :  Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was  2.8% in August  -- higher than the 2.6% rate in December 2016, Obama's last full month in office.  Overall unemployment ""Our job numbers for African Americans are the best in history. You saw the new ones came out; they're even better than they were two months ago. Hispanic, the best in history. Asian, the best in history. Overall, they're phenomenal. The best in 51 years. And I think we'll soon be historic on that one too."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain  ""We're doing -- we have this great economy. We're doing better than we've ever done. Our employment numbers are the best they've ever been and unemployment numbers also. We are doing great. But we should be cutting. There's no inflation."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry  ""And unemployment in the United States has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years, and very soon, we think that will be broken to be a historic number."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston  Facts First:  Trump was exaggerating in all three cases -- very slightly with ""51 years,"" more significantly when he said ""the best they've ever been."" The  unemployment rate  over this spring and summer -- 3.7% in each of June, July and August, 3.6% in each of April and May -- has been the lowest since December 1969, slightly less than 50 years ago; all of these rates were well off the record 2.5%, set in 1953. The dollar ""Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER!"" -- September 16  tweet    Facts First :  The dollar is not the strongest it has ever been against other currencies, according to various indices; it was significantly stronger in the 1980s and earlier this decade. You can read a longer version of this fact check  here .  Women's unemployment  Trump said at his New Mexico rally that unemployment numbers for women were the best in ""71 years."" Facts First :  This was his usual slight exaggeration. The rate this summer has been the lowest since 1953, 66 years ago. Inflation Trump claimed three times that there is ""no inflation."" Facts First: There is inflation: 1.7% for the last 12 months ending in August. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.4% for the 12 months ending in August. Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect. Facts First :  There is inflation:  1.7% for the last 12 months ending in August .  Core inflation , which excludes food and energy, was up 2.4% for the 12 months ending in August. Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.  Prescription drug prices Trump claimed that last year was ""the first year in 51 years where prices went down"" for prescription drugs.  -- September 16 exchange w with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain Facts First :  This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures. You can read a longer version of this fact check  here .  Pre-existing conditions ""And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. The Republicans will always do that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass  bills  that would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions, are now  trying  to get the courts to declare Obamacare void, without a plan to replace those pre-existing protections if their lawsuit succeeds. Air quality  ""And I'm an environmentalist, I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things. You know right now we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country?"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency  data . Additionally, there were more ""unhealthy air days"" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 American cities surveyed by the EPA, up from 702. Though there were significantly more ""unhealthy air days"" in Obama's first term than there have been in Trump's, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under Obama. Judicial vacancies ""President Obama said they (prisoners at Guantanamo Bay) were going to be totally completed and emptied out by the time he left office. And very much like judges, where, as you know, I ended up with 138 slots, you had a situation where that wasn't cleaned out."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One ""In a few short weeks, we'll be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges, including court of appeals judges, because President Obama did us a great favor. when I came in, I said, 'I assume I have no judges to appoint.' 'No sir, you have 138 judges.' 138, didn't put them up, couldn't get them approved. I don't know what happened, but we started off with 138."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Facts First :  Trump did not enter office with 138 judicial vacancies. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the confirmation of many of Obama's judicial nominees late in his term; Obama obviously didn't intend to ""hand"" vacancies to Trump."
"Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., said the case raises&nbsp;""constitutional issues"" regarding presidential privacy, on ""America's News HQ"" Sunday. Following  President Trump 's comments that he did  nothing wrong  during a phone call with  Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy,  Rep. Peter King , R-N.Y., said during an interview on "" America's News HQ "" that the case raises ""constitutional issues"" about the commander-in-chief's privacy.

King, a member of the House  Homeland Security  Committee, said there should be a high standard for making conversations involving the executive branch public, and compared the recent media frenzy to the hype surrounding the  Russia investigation . ADAM SCHIFF THREATENS TO DEFUND INTEL COMMUNITY UNLESS TRUMP  WHISTLEBLOWER DETAILS DISCLOSED ""Any facts coming out of a conversation between the president of the United States and a foreign leader, to me, it’s very difficult to see circumstances where that should be made public,"" he said. ""If it goes to Congress, it’ll be made public. This went on all during Russia,"" King added. ""It went to the Intelligence Committee -- then it was leaked to the New York Times... and it all turned out to be fake and to be false. But, the fact is, we can’t have the president of the United States, no matter who it is, being held hostage... even to the inspector general... This, to me, violates the separation of powers."" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif, had the opposite view and threatened to cut funding to the intel community if the contents of the call were not released. Trump fired back Sunday morning while speaking with reporters on his way to a rally in Houston, and maintained the call was above board. ""I said absolutely nothing wrong; it was perfect,"" Trump said. ""There was no quid pro quo, there was nothing,"" he later added.

"President Trump addresses the press following meeting with prime minister of Singapore. President Trump  mocked  CNN anchor Chris Cuomo  by repeatedly referring to him as ""Fredo"" -- just weeks after a video of the host taking offense at being called that name went viral. During a bilateral meeting with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the United Nations on Monday, Trump took several questions about the whistleblower controversy involving his communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. His phone call with the Ukraine leader is alleged to have involved a potential investigation into Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President and 2020 frontrunner  Joe Biden . When specifically asked if he approved lawyer Rudy Giuliani's handling of the controversy in various interviews, the president singled out a clash the former New York City mayor had with Cuomo on CNN last week. ""I think he was excellent,"" Trump responded. ""I watched it the other night... I haven't watched that show in a long time. I don't watch CNN because it's fake news, but I watched Rudy take apart Fredo."" CNN'S CARL BERNSTEIN COMPARES TRUMP-UKRAINE STORY TO WATERGATE Trump's ""Fredo"" insult was in reference to an  August confrontation that went down between Cuomo and a heckler , who taunted the CNN anchor with a nickname drawn from ""The Godfather"" movies. Fredo referred to the weak-minded and suggestible brother of Michael Corleone. ""The press doesn't give [Giuliani] credit because they take little tiny snippets where Rudy was a little bit -- if he mispronounces a word, they'll show that and they won't show the whole,"" Trump continued. ""Rudy Giuliani took Fredo to the cleaners. The first time I've watched CNN in a very long time. So I hate to watch it because it's so fake."" Last month, a video posted online showed a man telling Cuomo, in regard to the Fredo tag, ""I thought that was who you were."" ""No, punk-ass b----es from the right call me 'Fredo.' My name is Chris Cuomo. I'm an anchor on CNN,"" a heated Cuomo responded. ""'Fredo' was from 'The Godfather.' He was a weak brother and they use that as an Italian slur -- are any of you Italian?

CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, President Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was  eventually released  after objections from the Senate. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. Biden said Friday that the claim has no credibility.

"Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, among President Trump’s staunchest defenders, has publicly — if gently —  called on  the president to “tell us as much as he can without compromising executive privilege, so that we can understand what happened.”  The senator is referring to a whistle-blower complaint with the inspector general of the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, detailing multiple concerning acts by Mr. Trump, including  inappropriate promises  he may have made to a foreign leader. In a radio interview on Monday, Mr. Graham  predicted  that “President Trump is going to blow you away with his willingness to disclose and be transparent about this phone call, because I think he did nothing wrong and he has nothing to hide.” Mr. Trump would be wise to listen to Mr. Graham. The president, who says he did nothing wrong, should welcome the opportunity to let Congress clear up this matter. Mr. Atkinson, a Trump appointee, found the complaint to be of “urgent concern and credible,” prompting him to alert the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire. Under federal  law , Mr. Maguire had a responsibility to deliver the inspector general’s findings to Congress within a week. Instead, the Department of Justice advised Mr. Maguire  not to pass along the report . Mr. Atkinson felt  compelled  to alert Congress to the existence, but not the contents, of the complaint. As subsequent reporting has revealed, among the whistle-blower’s core allegations is that Mr. Trump  pressured  a foreign government to take steps that would damage a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. In a July phone call with the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr. Trump is said to have  repeatedly  urged Mr. Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, on a corruption investigation of Mr. Biden, focused on the tenure of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter on the board of a Ukranian gas company. At issue is not whether Mr. Trump spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart about Mr. Biden or even whether he accused Mr. Biden of corruption. The president  acknowledged  as much on Sunday, when he told reporters, “The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in  the Ukraine.” This jibes with what Mr. Giuliani said — far more  combatively  — in a Thursday  interview  on CNN. Pressed on whether he had asked Ukrainian officials to look into Mr. Biden, Mr. Giuliani initially said no, then, upon further questioning, declared, “Of course I did!” Whatever the nature and impetus for Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani’s pressure campaign, it came at a delicate moment in relations between the United States and Ukraine, a former Soviet republic. This summer the Trump administration,  without  any  warning ,  temporarily held up $250 million in military aid  aimed at helping Ukraine defend itself against aggression by Russia. At the time, the administration said it was  reviewing the program  to make sure the money was being used in the best interest of the United States. The money was released this month,  the same week that  three House committees announced plans to look into whether Mr. Trump had pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rival and whether his administration had suggested, explicitly or implicitly, that the aid money was contingent on that help. This is a complicated situation, and there are serious questions begging to be cleared up. The White House has worked to prevent that from happening. By refusing to turn over the whistle-blower report, the administration is following the same playbook it has used for all of Congress’s inquiries: deny, deflect and delay — possibly indefinitely. This time, lawmakers seem disinclined to tolerate such presidential contempt. In  a letter  on Sunday  to fellow House Democrats , Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned, “If the administration persists in blocking this whistle-blower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.” Ms. Pelosi gave the administration a deadline of Thursday, when Mr. Maguire is set to appear before the House Intelligence Committee, to turn over the whistle-blower’s “full complaint” and to “establish a path for the whistle-blower to speak directly to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as required by law.” In addition to Mr. Graham, Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, called on Mr. Trump in a Sunday  tweet  to end the stonewalling: “If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out.” Critical indeed. This should not be a partisan issue. Lawmakers from both parties have an interest, and a duty, in making clear that any president, in accordance with the law, is accountable to Congress.

"It's the latest example of how Republicans are extremely reluctant to criticize the leader of their party even in the face of a growing controversy with many outstanding questions.  The tone was set by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, when he opened the chamber floor and blasted Democrats for what he said was a politicization of the issue before the facts were known.  McConnell also refused to tell reporters if he believed the formal whistleblower complaint that's  being held back by the administration  should be made available to Congress or if Trump was wrong to discuss with the Ukrainian President possible investigations of Joe and Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  ""Is it a whistleblower or is it a leaker, I don't know which,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of the GOP leadership and Intelligence Committee, who said the matter may fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice for prosecution, not Congress for oversight.  Cornyn sharply pushed back when a reporter questioned why the senator thinks the person who filed a complaint with the Intelligence Community's Inspector General is not an actual whistleblower.  ""What makes you think he is?"" Cornyn asked.  Even Sen. Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina who chairs the Intelligence Committee, which is taking the lead on unpacking the allegations for the Senate, suggested he's not sure if the charges involve the intelligence community. ""I don't even know if the complaint even deals with the Intelligence Community,"" he said before sides-stepping questions about the appropriateness of Trump pressing the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens.  ""Talk to him,"" is all Burr would say, referring to Trump.  Sen. Kevin Cramer, a Republican senator from North Dakota, downplayed the President's conversation with Ukraine's President. ""I think as is often the case, it's a lot of hysteria over very little,"" Cramer said. As did Sen. Chuck Grassley, the most senior GOP senator who has a long history of advocating for and protecting government whistleblowers.  When Grassley was asked about Trump acknowledging that he brought up Biden in a call with Ukraine's President, he responded by turning the focus to Biden, saying, ""What you're asking me, you could ask me the same question, was it appropriate what Biden did?"" Sen. Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who sits on the Intelligence Committee, said he doesn't think Trump ""should've done it"" when asked about the President's phone call urging Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.  ""I don't think he should've done it but that's a far cry from what some people around here are claiming to know as fact that frankly we don't know as fact,"" Rubio said, adding that people are talking about impeachment so much the term has ""lost all meaning."" Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican of Wisconsin who spoke to the President about why aid for Ukraine had not been appropriated yet for the upcoming year before visiting Ukraine earlier this summer, said Trump told him he was evaluating the funding because ""he was concerned about corruption."" Johnson said he believed that was a ""legitimate concern."" Connecticut Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, was asked if he is concerned some GOP senators will try to refer the whistleblower matter to the Justice Department for prosecution of a leaker of classified information:  ""This is an extraordinary moment. We're seeing our country turn into a banana republic. Republicans better be careful what they wish for because a Democratic president could use the same tools Donald Trump is to turn the White House into one big extension of his reelection campaign,"" Murphy said. ""If that's the direction they take, attacking the whistleblower, trying to coverup this corruption, it's a really, really said day for the country,"" he added."
"WASHINGTON — Senator  Bernie Sanders  on Tuesday unveiled a proposal to create a new tax on the wealth of the richest Americans, including a steep tax on billionaires that  could  greatly diminish their fortunes. With the proposal, Mr. Sanders is embracing an idea that has been a centerpiece of the campaign of his top progressive rival, Senator  Elizabeth Warren . But while Ms. Warren came first, Mr. Sanders is going bigger. His wealth tax would apply to a larger number of households, impose a higher top rate and raise more money. Mr. Sanders’s plan  to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires. His tax  would  cut in half  the  wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years,  according to two economists  who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan. Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the  housing plan he released last week  and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for “Medicare for all.” “Let me be very clear: As president of the United States, I will reduce the outrageous and grotesque and immoral level of income and wealth inequality,” Mr. Sanders said in an interview. “What we are trying to do is demand and implement a policy which significantly reduces income and wealth inequality in America by telling the wealthiest families in this country they cannot have so much wealth.” Asked if he thought billionaires should exist in the United States, Mr. Sanders said, “I hope the day comes when they don’t.” He added, “It’s not going to be tomorrow.” [ Sign up for our politics newsletter  and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] “ I don’t think that billionaires should exist ,” he said, adding that there would always be rich people and others with less money.   “This proposal does not eliminate billionaires, but it eliminates a lot of the wealth that billionaires have, and I think that’s exactly what we should be doing.” The proposal from Mr. Sanders is the latest sign of the push in the Democratic Party to collect substantially more revenue from the wealthiest Americans by rethinking how they are taxed — a move that  could  provide large sums of money to finance new social programs. And it is a significant development in the competition of ideas between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren,  the two leading progressive candidates in  the Democratic primary race . Democrats Want to Tax the Rich. Here’s How Those Plans Would Work (or Not). We break down the benefits and risks to the four main ideas that presidential candidates have embraced. Both of their plans would need to be passed by Congress in order to take effect — a virtual impossibility unless Democrats win control of the Senate in the 2020 elections, and far from a sure thing even then. Ms. Warren’s plan touched off a number of questions about the feasibility of  creating a wealth tax , including whether such a tax would be constitutional, how it would be enforced and whether it would generate as much money as has been projected. On Tuesday, Ms. Warren welcomed Mr. Sanders’s plan. “I’m delighted to see people talking about a wealth tax,” she  told WBUR . “I think it’s great because this is how we make big structural change in this economy. We need all of the presidential candidates talking about it; where are the rest of them?” Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, would create an annual tax that would apply to households with a net worth above $32 million — about 180,000 households in total, or about the top 0.1 percent, according to the economists who worked on the plan. He would impose a 1 percent tax on net worth  above $32 million , with increasing marginal rates topping out at 8 percent on net worth over $10 billion.  For single filers, the brackets would be halved, meaning the tax would kick in at $16 million. By contrast, the wealth tax proposed by Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, would apply to households with a net worth above $50 million — an estimated 70,000 households in total. The structure of her plan is simpler: She would apply a 2 percent tax on net worth from $50 million to $1 billion, and a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion. Unlike the Sanders plan, the tax brackets would be the same for married and single filers. Bernie Sanders’s wealth tax proposal $32 million to $50 million net worth: 1 percent marginal tax rate $50  million to $250 million: 2 percent  $250 million to $500 million: 3 percent  $500 million to $1 billion: 4 percent  $1 billion to $2.5 billion: 5 percent  $2.5 billion to $5 billion: 6 percent  $5 billion to $10 billion: 7 percent  Over $10 billion: 8 percent Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax proposal $50 million to $1 billion: 2 percent Over $1 billion: 3 percent  Note: The brackets shown for the Sanders proposal are for married filers; the brackets would be halved for single filers. The Warren proposal uses the same brackets for married and single filers. Mr. Sanders’s tax is projected to raise $4.35 trillion over a decade, while Ms. Warren’s is projected to raise $2.6 trillion over the same time period. Those estimates were produced by  Emmanuel Saez  and  Gabriel Zucman , two economists at the University of California, Berkeley, with whom both the Sanders and Warren campaigns consulted as they developed their proposals.  (The projection for Ms. Warren’s plan differs slightly from their  original estimate  of $2.75 trillion earlier this year.) “The Sanders plan is really pitched at the idea that we don’t want billionaires and decabillionaires to be billionaires and decabillionaires for as long as they currently are,” Mr. Saez said. “It’s going to erode their fortunes much faster than the Warren wealth tax.” Mr. Sanders included several steps in his plan to enforce the tax, including creating a “national wealth registry,” increasing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and requiring audits of many taxpayers who are subject to the wealth tax, including all billionaires. Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman calculated how the Warren and Sanders wealth taxes would have affected the fortunes of the richest Americans had each been in effect since 1982. The fortune of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder who Forbes said was worth $160 billion last year, would have been $87 billion under the Warren plan and $43 billion under the Sanders plan. Over all, the economists found, the cumulative wealth of the top 15 richest Americans in 2018 — amounting to $943 billion, using estimates from Forbes — would have been $434 billion under the Warren plan and $196 billion under the Sanders plan. Mr. Sanders is  hardly a newcomer to the idea of a wealth tax . In a 1997 book, he wrote that it was “time, high time, to establish a tax on wealth similar to those that exist in most European countries.” In 2017, he included a wealth tax on a  list of financing options  for Medicare for all. Ms. Warren  was quick to harness the idea  in the 2020 race. She released her wealth tax proposal in January, weeks before Mr. Sanders began his campaign. Since then, the proposal has become a cornerstone of Ms. Warren’s campaign and a fixture of her stump speech, even prompting chants of “Two cents!” from crowds. The money from her tax would go toward other policy plans she has issued, including her proposals for universal child care, student debt cancellation and tuition-free public college."

"Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J., side steps question on Biden's ties to Ukraine, as Congress beats impeachment drum. 2020 presidential  hopeful  Sen. Cory Booker , D-N.J., sidestepped a question about fellow candidate  Joe Biden 's ties to  Ukraine  on "" Fox & Friends "" Wednesday and said  President Trump 's latest actions are a ""bridge too far"" for Democrats. ""Where are we coming in as a nation when both  Republicans  and  Democrats  see an ally, Ukraine, under attack and a president of the United States withholds that aid in order to go after a political opponent? I think that was a bridge too far for people,"" he said. Host Steve Doocy asked about the double standard regarding Biden and Ukraine after it was discovered the former vice president's son, Hunter, had ties to a Ukranian natural gas firm that was under investigation for corruption and paid him $50,000 a month. Booker refused to address the question directly and said Trump's actions were more severe. ""It's like saying, here's a firecracker over here. Pay no attention to the nuclear bomb going off,"" Booker replied. ""A president of the United States of America, in order to pursue his own personal benefit, withholds aid from an ally under attack."" HOUSE DEMOCRAT WHO ENDORSED BIDEN SAYS IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO 'CLEAR UP' QUESTIONS ON SON'S UKRAINE DEALINGS Doocy continued to press Booker on Biden's possible corruption, but the New Jersey Democrat stood firm and kept the focus on Trump. ""The president of the United States should withhold bipartisan-approved aid that is life or death? I've been to the... region. I've seen the violence,"" he said, claiming there is ""no evidence whatsoever"" of wrongdoing by Biden after the issue was investigated. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Booker also said Congress is only using the threat of impeachment of President Trump as ""leverage"" to force the  White House  to release the transcript of Trump's call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky after it was alleged he pressured him to investigate Biden by withholding federal funding. ""We need the leverage, through an impeachment inquiry, to be able to better get to the truth,"" he said earlier in the interview. ""When they started with [Richard] Nixon they didn't know the truth yet. The public was mostly on the side of Nixon until the truth started coming out."""
"As with so much in the Trump presidency, it all starts with Hillary Clinton. Here's what we know: Giuliani's accusation Rudy Giuliani, the President's attorney and political attack dog, said on CNN Thursday night that his ongoing efforts to  pursue Clinton took him to Ukraine . First he alleged, without evidence, that she and Democrats were behind the effort to discredit Paul Manafort, who is currently in prison for, among other things, laundering money he was paid as a political consultant in Ukraine. Then things turned away from Clinton. ""In the course of investigating that, I found out this incredible story about Joe Biden, that he bribed the President of the Ukraine in order to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,"" said Giuliani, alleging a media coverup. ""That is an astounding scandal of major proportions, which all of you have covered up for five or six months."" From there the interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo went completely off the rails and Giuliani eventually admitted he had asked the current Ukrainian government to look into Biden. ""Of course I did!"" he said. But the President's attorney trying to get action from Ukraine is one thing. It would be something different entirely if the administration used official leverage to get a foreign country to investigate a US political rival, especially just months after special counsel Robert Mueller detailed multiple interactions between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia but found nothing rising to the level of coordination between campaign associates and officials and Russian governmental officials. Trump spoke with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 and that phone call may be part of what led to the complaint against Trump. Asked Friday about that July 25 call and whether he mentioned Biden to the Ukrainian President,  Trump tried to deflect back to Biden . ""It doesn't matter what I discuss,"" he said. ""But I will say this: Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case."" On Friday afternoon, the Wall Street Journal reported that on that phone call Trump pressured the new president ""about eight times"" to work with Giuliani on Biden, citing people familiar with the matter. Vice President Mike Pence recently met with Zelensky and was asked about Giuliani's efforts and whether the administration has held up aid to Ukraine as a result. REPORTER: Specifically, number one, did you discuss Joe Biden at all during that meeting yesterday with the Ukrainian President?  And number two, can you assure Ukraine that the hold-up of that money has absolutely nothing to do with efforts, including by Rudy Giuliani, to try to dig up dirt on the Biden family? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE:  Well, on the first question, the answer is no.  But we — with President Zelensky yesterday, we discussed — we discussed America's support for Ukraine and the upcoming decision the President will make on the latest tranche of financial support in great detail. Ukraine uses the aid in its efforts against Russian separatists, part of a long-term conflict with Russia. Biden's efforts in Ukraine Despite Giuliani's allegation, there has been no media coverup of the allegations against Biden.  The New York Times wrote about Biden's son  and his activities back in May and made clear that Trump's allies were pushing it. The President tweeted about it at the time. Since then, Trump, Giuliani and others have come back to the story repeatedly. Asked about Trump's statement Friday, Biden said ""Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion."" ""Not one single one, and so I have no comment except the President should start to be (the) President,"" Biden said. The crux of Giuliani's allegation is that Joe Biden tried to have Ukraine's top prosecutor ousted in 2016 because of an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. At the time, Hunter Biden was serving on Burisma's board. But the reality is much more nuanced. It is absolutely true that at the same time Burisma was being investigated, western governments, including the Obama administration wanted the prosecutor removed due to concerns about corruption in his own office. Biden too opposed  the prosecutor in Ukraine, Viktor Shokin, and threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine. He's actually bragged about it. Recounting a trip he made to Kiev in 2016, he said it showed the US was able to get Ukraine to take corruption more seriously. ""I looked at them and said: I'm leaving in six hours,"" Biden  said during an event at the Council of Foreign Relations in 2018 . ""If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" None of this is a particularly good look for the Bidens, but there's no proof or suggestion of any actual wrongdoing. At least one former official in the prosecutor's office said the investigation into Burisma had already been shelved by the time Joe Biden was threatening to withhold financial aid unless Ukraine replaced its top prosecutor. It's also not clear if Hunter Biden was a focus of that investigation when it was occurring. In an interview on May 14 posted on Facebook by his assistant, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yury Lutsenko said Burisma paid an entity connected to Hunter Biden ""millions,"" but added, ""from my point of view, a board member can be paid whatever a company decides ... they didn't violate any Ukrainian laws.""  He said that he said it was a matter for US law to consider, not Ukrainian investigators. Lutsenko in May said he was looking to ""reanimate"" an investigation of Burisma, Hunter Biden's former employer -- but that apparently never happened. Lutsenko left office in August after the new administration of Zelensky took office. Giuliani himself went to meet with a representative of Zelensky after the President's call with Trump in July. According to Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Ukrainian officials understand there is a link between what Giuliani was asking of the Ukrainians to do and getting US military aid. Murphy met with the Ukrainian President a few weeks ago and described the scene on Twitter. ""Zelensky did not explicitly connect the two in our meeting, but he was VERY concerned about the cut off of aid, and VERY aware of the conversations that Rudy Giuliani was having with his team. I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump's campaign operatives. He agreed,"" Murphy explained in a series of tweets.   Trump's playbook Fostering conspiracy theories about his rival was a strategy that worked for Trump in 2016 as he used decades of conservative conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton to label her ""crooked"" and suggest she should be in jail rather than the White House. Biden, however, is not followed by the same political taint as the Clintons and the effort by Trump and his allies may now have led to a whistleblower sounding the alarm under a law meant to protect intelligence officials for uncovering improper activity. The specifics of the whistleblower complaint remain a mystery and could remain that way as Trump's new acting Director of National Intelligence refuses to share information about the complaint with Congress. The Intelligence Community Inspector General has caused alarm by publicly saying he is being kept from doing his job. Father and son Hunter Biden's personal life and substance abuse issues have already caused angst for the former vice president. The overlap between the father and son's political and business interests have fueled GOP attacks that Biden is little more than a self-interested politician. Whether the facts fully support that case appears to be an afterthought for his critics. GOP researchers have been digging through Hunter Biden's career history as well as the points where it appears to intersect with his father's, particularly where it pertains to Ukraine and China, another topic Giuliani brought up during his interview with Cuomo."

"Trump addresses reporters as he arrives at the United Nations, says 'what Biden did was wrong.' Mark Levin  fired off a series of tweets Monday  after Fox News reported  that one source said the whistleblower at the center of the controversy surrounding  President Trump's  phone call with Ukraine's leader did not have ""firsthand knowledge"" of that call. Levin claimed the development turned what would be a true whistleblower case into the political equivalent of ""hearsay."" ""We have since learned that the so-called whistleblower had no firsthand information, which means he's not a whistleblower at all,"" he said. ""Lawyers call this hearsay, which is unreliable and no better than gossip."" SOURCE SAYS WHISTLEBLOWER DIDN'T HAVE FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT UKRAINE CONTROVERSY TURNS INTO DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR BIDEN Democrats, meanwhile, have seized on r eports that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President  Joe Biden's  family’s dealings, citing those claims to revive calls for impeachment.

One top Democrat,  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,  D-N.Y. has demanded  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. , urge the White House to release the call transcript, insisting that the Senate take this "" national security matter seriously ."" WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM In its original story Friday,  The Wall Street Journal  reported that,  in the phone call , Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden -- a son of the former Delaware senator. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate.

The source said that it is made clear  in the complaint itself that the whistleblower  did not have direct knowledge of the call between Trump and Zelensky. Fox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials are on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower is not one of those people. It's unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation, or learned of it another way. Fox News' Jake Gibson, Alex Pappas, Adam Shaw and Judson Berger contributed to this report ."
"Now, one poll doesn't mean much, and Quinnipiac's result is well within the margin of error, so there's no clear leader. But when you put Quinnipiac's latest into the context of other recent polls, it's pretty clear that Warren is gaining everywhere.  Warren's  national numbers  are up since the September primary debate. She comes in with an average of 23% in debate qualifying polls taken after the debate. That's still behind Biden's 28%, but not by much. The trendline is what is important here. Warren was at 18% in an average of qualifying national polls taken in September before the debates.  The 5-point climb for Warren post-debate seems to be a continuation of a trend we've seen for months. In an average of debate qualifying polls taken before the first set of debates in June, Warren was 12%. That rose to 16% in July. In other words, Warren's increasing numbers are the result not of one moment but of many. What makes Warren's movement so much more powerful is that it's not just national. It's happening in the early caucus and primary states as well.  Warren jumped to 22% in our latest  CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll  of likely Iowa caucusgoers. Biden was right nearby at 20%, which is within Warren's margin of error. Again, though, it's not about whether Warren is leading or not. It's the long-term trend. In our previous polls, she's up from 9% in March and 15% in June. For comparison, Biden's gone in the other direction: 27% in March to 23% in June to 20% now. These trends are backed up by the  average of polls .  We're seeing the same thing in New Hampshire. A  Monmouth University poll  out Tuesday put Warren at 27% and Biden at 25%, another within-the-margin-of-error result. The trend line, like in Iowa and nationally, is Warren's friend. She jumped from 8% in May to 27% now. Biden, on the other hand, is down from 36% in May.  Other polls in the state  show similar movement.  What's notable in these polls is you see Warren showing signs of life in groups that Biden should be dominating.  Nationally, you can make the argument that Warren is rising with black voters. She reached her highest level of 19% in the Quinnipiac poll. She's still well behind Biden (who is at 40%), though it's a far cry from the 10% she was at in  Quinnipiac's August poll.  A recent  NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll  had her up 5 points among black voters from  their previous poll.  If Warren has any sort of breakthrough with black voters, it could break Biden's supposed South Carolina firewall.  And in New Hampshire, you see Warren at 31% and Biden at 28% among likely primary voters 65 years and older. This was a group that favored Biden 53% to Warren's 9% in May.  This crosstab gets at something pivotal about Warren: Unlike Biden or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, she doesn't have an age gap in her support. That may make it easier for her to unite the Democratic Party.  Now, does any of this mean Warren's the odds-on-favorite to win the nomination? No. If you were to look at either the  Iowa  or  national polls , her chance of winning either in Iowa or nationally is about 30%. There's a 70% chance of her not being the nominee, which isn't surprising, given how many candidates are running.  Further, most caucusgoers and primary voters say they haven't made up their mind. This is especially true of Warren backers. When you look at only those who say their mind is made up, Biden holds a double-digit advantage over Warren both in Iowa and nationally.  Still, the bottom line is that Warren is in her best position so far to win the nomination -- though there is plenty of time to go. "
"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden addresses whistleblower complaint, says if President Trump does not fully cooperate with a congressional investigation then Congress will have no choice but to initiate impeachment. An old video resurfaced Wednesday showing  then-Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del.,  admonishing Republicans considering impeaching  then-President Bill Clinton  in 1998, arguing that Congress should only pursue proceedings based on principle rather than ""politics."" ""The American people don’t think that they have made a mistake by electing Bill Clinton,"" Biden said in a recently-surfaced video, ""and we in Congress had better be very careful before we upset their decision, and make darn sure that we are able to convince them if we decide to upset their decision that our decision to impeach him was based upon principle and not politics."" The video surfaced after Biden appeared to offer support for  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's  decision, announced on Tuesday, to open a formal impeachment inquiry on  President Trump . NANCY PELOSI ON BILL CLINTON'S IMPEACHMENT IN 1998: 'REPUBLICANS ARE PARALYZED WITH HATRED' ""Congress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable,"" he said in a statement released by his campaign. Biden's statement specifically called out the administration for suppressing the whistleblower report cited by Pelosi, D-Calif., in Tuesday's  announcement . According to Pelosi, the administration violated U.S. law when the Director of National Intelligence blocked an unnamed whistleblower from speaking out on Trump's comments to Ukrainian leadership. The administration has denied any wrongdoing and claimed whistleblower statutes didn't apply to that particular report. The specter of impeachment has naturally conjured media comparisons to Clinton's administration-- the last time the House of Representatives impeached a sitting president. The House famously impeached Clinton, accusing him of committing perjury, among other things, when he lied under oath about his affair with White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, Biden, at the time, defended the president, suggesting that an impeachment inquiry might subvert the will of the American people. “This is their president we are talking about,"" Biden said. ""The President of the United States does not serve at the pleasure of the legislature, does not serve at the pleasure of Joe Biden, does not serve at the pleasure of Henry Hyde, does not serve at the pleasure of the Congress, as a prime minister does in a parliamentary system."" ""He is elected directly by the people of the United States of America, and the election of a president is the only nationwide vote the American people will ever cast and that’s a big deal."" TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DEFENDS UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT ACCURACY, AS DEMS THROW SHADE The issue could become even more complicated for Biden, now the  2020 Democratic frontrunner , as the Ukraine controversy centered on Trump seeking an investigation into corruption allegations surrounding the former vice president. Republicans and the president have responded to Democratic attacks by framing impeachment as another attack in their relentless war to remove Trump from office. Their rhetoric bore a resemblance to Biden's in that the party has accused Democratic leadership of trying to undermine the 2016 election results. ""There's been a double standard from Democrats since day one with this president,' said Republican National Committee Chairwoman  Ronna McDaniel . ""They have refused to accept the results of the election, boycotting the inauguration, the 2-year Russia hoax where the president was clearly exonerated, no collusion, no obstruction. And now this, where they rush to judgment in a knee-jerk way to bring impeachment proceedings when they haven't even read the transcript or heard from the inspector general."" Pelosi, in 1998, also described Republicans as ""paralyzed with hatred"" as they pursued impeachment against Clinton. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Today the Republican majority is not judging the president with fairness, but impeaching him with a vengeance,"" then-House Minority Leader Pelosi declared on the House floor in December 1998. She continued, ""In the investigation of the president, fundamental principles which Americans hold dear -- fairness, privacy, checks, and balances -- have been seriously violated and why? Because we are here today because the Republicans in the House are paralyzed with hatred of President Clinton. ... Until the Republicans free themselves of that hatred, our country will suffer.”"
"Days after dismissing and downplaying a whistleblower's complaint , Trump has now acknowledged he discussed Biden in a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and CNN has reported that the President pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. But Trump has since tried to obfuscate any wrongdoing on his part and instead try to train the spotlight on Biden. ""Joe Biden and his son are corrupt,"" Trump claimed without offering specifics on Monday, his first day at the United Nations General Assembly, an annual gathering of world leaders in New York. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump added: ""If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they'd be getting the electric chair right now."" He did not specify what Biden ""did."" The President also denied claims he put pressure on the Ukrainian leader by threatening to withhold US aid, saying: ""I did not make a statement that 'you have to do this or I'm not going to give you aid.' I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that."" ""There was no pressure put on them whatsoever. I put no pressure on them whatsoever. I could have. I think it probably, possibly would have been OK if I did,"" he said. The Ukrainian government said this of the July 25 call : ""Donald Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA."" Trump also sent mixed signals on whether he would release a transcript of the call. ""It was a very nice call. I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon,"" he said, but then added that he was hesitant as to whether the transcript would be released, saying it may set a bad precedent for future calls with world leaders."
"KEENE, N.H. —  Beto O’Rourke  began his rally with a non sequitur. He told a story of how he was killing time at a park a few hours earlier when he happened upon a woman pounding on a set of drums, with her car parked next to her, and the radio blasting “Any Way You Want It” by Journey. “And I thought, that is so punk rock!” Mr. O’Rourke effused. Mr. O’Rourke, the pin-balling presidential candidate from Texas, told the audience that he felt fortunate to have witnessed such “a beautiful, powerful, transcendent moment.” He then got to the point of his story. Or not: “I don’t even know why I’m telling you this,” he acknowledged. “Except that I had to share this with somebody.” Mr. O’Rourke’s entire campaign sometimes feels like one giant non sequitur. Where was this story going? Was there a point to it? And did he even care if anyone was taken aback? The answer that last question would seem to be “no,” and has become especially resonant since Aug. 3, when 22 people were killed in a mass shooting in Mr. O’Rourke’s hometown, El Paso. In the heightened aftermath of the slaughter, the once-celebrated candidate has found himself  restored to, or at least closer to, the place of political prominence  he seemed to relinquish from the second he began running for president early this year. “I think I feel differently personally and that can’t help but come through,” Mr. O’Rourke said in an interview, discussing how the shooting had changed the character, if not necessarily the trajectory, of his campaign. “I think El Paso reminded me or brought home for me how urgent this situation is out there in the country right now.” Mr. O’Rourke has become the most vocal candidate in pushing for tougher gun laws, including bans on the assault weapons used in numerous mass shootings. The issue has provided a kind of emotional centerpiece to a campaign that had seemed to lack one. It has also, in recent days, stirred the most emphatic crowd reactions at Mr. O’Rourke’s events to date, including a standing ovation Saturday at the  Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines , where 17 Democratic presidential candidates appeared. “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,”  Mr. O’Rourke said  at this month's Democratic debate in Houston. The refrain — one of the most potent of his campaign thus far — earned him both instant applause inside the hall and near-instant condemnation from gun-rights advocates, some in the form of the threats that he says have become an ominous background companion to his life. He was also admonished by many Democratic leaders who worried that his vow to take away guns would confirm every caricature of a radicalized left intent on punishing law-abiding gun-owners. “I don’t know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O’Rourke,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said in a conference call with reporters. Mr. O’Rourke said he took pride in getting attacked by Mr. Schumer and President Trump (who had tweeted at him) on the same day. “It shows me we’re doing something right,” Mr. O’Rourke said Thursday, following a visit to a marijuana dispensary in Oakland, Calif. He said that provoking Mr. Trump and particularly Mr. Schumer showed he was willing to speak plainly and directly and not as a normal politician would. Later that day, in a session with reporters, Mr. O’Rourke would taunt Mr. Schumer for doing “absolutely nothing” on guns. “Ask Chuck Schumer what he’s been able to get done,” he said. To observe Mr. O’Rourke in recent week s  is to witness one candidate’s unfiltered attempt at a midcourse transformation. It’s a shift that has taken him far beyond the norms of a typical presidential primary campaign itinerary, with stops in California to tour Skid Row in Los Angeles, San Quentin State Prison in Marin County and Blunts and Moore, the pot dispensary in Oakland, where he unveiled a plan to legalize marijuana. For his part, Mr. O’Rourke, says he could give a damn about adhering to the niceties of campaigns, and he has been proving as much with his frequent deployment of four-letter words more incendiary than “damn.” “Over the last five weeks, I’ve just been focused on saying what’s on my mind, being myself,” Mr. O’Rourke said. “And not really in the slightest being interested in polls, or how things poll, or what you’re supposed to say.” That’s fortunate, or at least handy spin, given that Mr. O’Rourke’s poll numbers have been stuck in the low-single digits for months, with negligible movement since El Paso. The blessing, say Mr. O’Rourke’s campaign advisers and supporters, is that he is once again the unvarnished candidate that captivated them during his near miss Senate campaign in Texas last year against the incumbent Republican Ted Cruz. He is still doing some campaigning as it used to exist: talking to people in early-voting states .   His audience sizes often number just in the double-digits, which could be viewed as a comedown  compared to the thousands that were thronging Mr. O’Rourke during his Senate race last year — including one September rally in Austin featuring Willie Nelson that drew upward of 50,000 people. Did he find this contrast deflating, a reporter asked Mr. O’Rourke after a low-key rally at Keene State College in New Hampshire? “Oh, I’m really grateful to anyone who would forgo a perfectly fine movie or dinner date to spend some time on a Friday night with a candidate for the presidency,” Mr. O’Rourke replied, offering perhaps the only possible answer a politician could give (what candidate would admit to being “deflated?”). Mr. O’Rourke still manages to project earnestness with his entire body.  He keeps casually dropping in his now-signature profanity  because, he explained, being polite and restrained “doesn’t always express the anger  o r the urgency that I feel.” His zigzagging trajectory over the last year can be ordered into pronounced phases. Last fall — the peak of his Beto-Mania Phase — ended in a narrow loss to Mr. Cruz. Nevertheless, the hype persisted. “We did not see that coming,” Mr. O’Rourke said of the continued attention, which ushered in a new phase. Late on election night, a couple of supporters wandered into Mr. O’Rourke’s El Paso home to commiserate. “They were just these drunk dudes in their teens who were bummed out and decided to come to Beto’s house,” Mr. O’Rourke recalled. “They just walked in and were like ‘Hey dude, we’re just so sorry you lost, can I get a selfie with you?’” “And I was like, ‘Sure, but you can’t just walk into someone’s house like this.’ And they were like ‘Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.’” Mr. O’Rourke nursed his defeat, set out on a road trip and went to the dentist, live-streaming as he went. He decided to run for president.  From the outset, the enterprise seemed to lack definition.  He was outshone and overtaken in a crowded field of movement progressives (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren), an established elder (Joe Biden) and new faces (Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris) who seemed brighter than last year’s meteor. He came off shaky and overwhelmed in the first two debates. Beto-mania 2018 seemed far away. After the Democratic debate in Houston this month, Mr. O’Rourke said he had struggled in the earlier debates because “I suck at acting.” He felt that he had been too scripted and rehearsed before, so he tried to be less so this time. “The first 30 or 40 minutes is like” — he growled out the sound of an explosion, pantomiming a hand-motion over his head that seemed to signify his brain blowing up. (Debates can be disorienting, is what appeared to be his point.) At one point, Cory Booker was asked whether Americans should abide by vegan diets, as he does. The New Jersey senator replied: “No,” and added, “actually, I want to translate that into Spanish — ‘No.” “I wanted to kind of like, high-five him across the stage,” Mr. O’Rourke said, and he later commended Mr. Booker for the line backstage.  “And then Joe Biden said something really nice,” Mr. O’Rourke said. “And then he and I talked a little bit and had one of those little moments.” Mr. O’Rourke can sometimes come off like an excited adolescent talking about a campaign-themed teen tour. He is collecting experiences, searching for something authentic. Here is something authentic: fear, of which there is no shortage in the country, especially around guns. The morning after the debate, Mr. O’Rourke pulled out his cellphone and called up a text message he had just received. It was from an unidentified party inviting him — and not in a nice way — to “come take my AK-47.” “I have been getting these messages from different numbers, emails, you know,” he said, explaining that people have been arrested after making threats on his life. Mr. O’Rourke has three young children and is fully aware of what’s possible. No security detail is evident around him. People show up with guns at his rallies and many know where he lives. He has become one of the biggest lightning rods in this hottest of national debates. Does he himself get scared? “For me, this is a great question,” Mr. O’Rourke said. “I think it goes to the heart of why we haven’t made progress.” He was referring to “progress” in stopping gun violence, not progress as a campaign. Yes, people are scared, he said, intimidated by the threats and perceived political risks and frightened into silence. “People keep begging us to do something,” he said. “It’s really powerful. And that’s the judgment I fear, more than people threatening us with guns.” Is this a higher purpose or another phase? At the very least, Mr. O’Rourke has burrowed a place for himself in the 2020 free-for-all, wherever he is headed. He has gotten people’s attention again, including from the president, who tweeted that Mr. O’Rourke’s vow to confiscate some assault weapons had “made it much harder to make a deal” on guns. “Dummy Beto,” is how the president addressed him. Asked about this in San Quentin, Mr. O’Rourke said he “could care less.”"
"At the same time, Zelensky must be circumspect and consider how Russian President Vladimir Putin might try to capitalize on Ukraine's being increasingly -- and unfairly -- portrayed as a  cesspool of corruption. The Trump-Zelensky meeting comes amid slipping support for Ukraine among Republican elected officials, at a time when Zelensky is deep in a high-stakes effort to bring Putin to the bargaining table. This diplomacy is part of an ambitious effort by Zelensky to make good on an  election  promise to end the deadly five-year military conflict with Russia in the east of the country. Zelensky made that pledge on the premise he could count on the full security backing of the United States. But that assumption is now at risk of falling apart for one main reason: Donald Trump. In July, Trump, perhaps sensing weakness in the neophyte politician, allegedly  tried  to pressure Zelensky in a phone call to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. On Monday, CNN  reported  that about a week before the call took place, Trump had ordered a hold on nearly $400 million in economic and military aid, possibly to extort Zelensky into investigating Biden's son. (Trump said  Tuesday  that he would release a full, unredacted transcript of the call on Thursday.) Trusted diplomatic sources in Ukraine tell me that Zelensky will likely try to keep the meeting low-key and seek to extract an outcome that can be spun positively to the public. As Ukraine is currently in  talks with the IMF  for a three-year, $5 billion loan, officials might not be eager to upset the United States, one of the bank's key voting members. Indeed,  comments  ahead of the meeting from Ukraine Foreign Affairs Minister Vadym Prystaiko suggest that Ukraine is taking a go-softly approach with an emphasis on energy security and keeping bilateral relations robust while Ukraine remains in conflict with Russia. But that's not good enough. Those in Trump's orbit have been issuing extraordinarily negative portrayals of Ukraine: Marc Lotter, director of strategic communications for the Trump 2020 campaign,  told  CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" Monday night that ""Ukraine has had a problem with corruption for some time,"" and Trump has  asked , ""Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?"" Given these negative portrayals in American media, the Ukrainian President needs to punch back hard -- harder than he's ever punched in his life. The negative image of Ukraine emerging from Trumpworld has played into the Russian narrative of Ukraine as a failed state, and could even give pretext to an opportunistic Kremlin for more military adventurism in Ukraine. For Zelensky, the timing for the equivalent of a diplomatic knock-out punch is perfect, as Trump -- now dealing with a brand-new  impeachment inquiry  for allegedly using US taxpayer dollars, or at least the weight of his office, to pressure a foreign country to dig up dirt on a domestic political rival -- is in a significantly weakened state.  Calling out Trump would earn Zelensky respect worldwide, especially among European allies. Even more importantly, such a move would show strength to Putin at a time when Ukraine is tantalizingly close to gaining an upper hand with the Kremlin. In his first few weeks in office, Zelensky managed to negotiate a complex  prisoner swap  with Russia, with  another  reportedly in the works for October, and he may meet with Putin for the first time at an upcoming peace summit brokered by French President Emmanuel Macron. Further, given these high stakes, a hastily arranged meeting with Speaker Pelosi and the  Congressional Ukraine Caucus  could be beneficial in publicizing Ukraine's side of the story.   Astonishingly, Republican leaders, traditionally strong backers of Ukraine, have stayed silent while Trump has essentially thrown a country at war with Russia under the bus, placing Ukraine in an impossible position by withholding congressionally approved aid. Ukrainian government officials are livid. ""The characterizations of levels of corruption in Ukraine are grossly inaccurate. With stalwart US assistance, Ukraine has done more in five years to turn its society and economy around than any other country anywhere,""  UkraineInvest  chairman Daniel Bilak tells me. ""It's disappointing to hear these comments just as we are seeing a huge uptick in US investor interest in Ukraine since Zelensky's election. His government of young reformers is rolling out full-bore the most ambitious reform program in Ukraine's and perhaps the region's history."" Even though some European countries are beginning to show weakening support for Ukraine (indeed, Macron wants a rapprochement with Russia), Ukraine is better off among European friends than working with an American administration that will do almost anything to win reelection -- including pressuring a foreign government to investigate a political opponent.   The timing is especially sensitive, as Ukraine prepares for a  four-party peace summit  later this fall, known as the Normandy Format and brokered by Macron. It's the best shot at a lasting peace deal Ukraine has had for a long time. Of course, Ukraine wouldn't be where it is today without US economic and military aid, US help in avoiding crushing Russian sanctions, and US support for anti-corruption efforts. Ukraine has also benefited from crucial US backing in the UN Security Council. Contrary to  claims  by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that all the Obama administration did for Ukraine was to ""provide blankets,"" Washington  extended $75 million  in military aid in 2015, including Humvees and drones. Under Obama, the United States was the largest contributor of funds and personnel to the entity I used to work for, the  Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine.  In the heady days of 2014, after Russia forcibly annexed Crimea and dispatched armed ""little green men"" to the Donbas, the mission relied heavily on guidance from US officials (as well as help from the Swiss). But just because the United States has been a friend in the past does not mean Ukraine has to allow itself to be extorted and humiliated by a trusted ally. When he was playing the Ukrainian president known as Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko in the Ukrainian TV comedy  ""Servant of the People,""  Zelensky took a phone call from German Chancellor Angela Merkel in which she offered Ukraine membership in the European Union. The TV president exploded in a fit of joy. Turns out Merkel had dialed the wrong number, and the news was meant for the president of Montenegro. In response, Holoborodko devolved into a profanity-laced meltdown. The real Zelensky may want to remind himself of that made-for-TV defeat when he meets with Trump on Wednesday. The Ukrainian President should make sure he comes through with a win befitting his government of young reformers -- and the proud people of Ukraine who have suffered enough humiliation over the years from real enemies. Zelensky has his moment set up for him. Will he use it?"
"President Trump to release Ukraine call transcript; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham on Biden's Ukraine ties. Sen.  Lindsey Graham , R-S.C., told  Sean Hannity  Tuesday that former Vice President  Joe Biden  and his son Hunter Biden's connections to Ukraine should be investigated. “We’ve looked at the Trump family and the Trump connections to Russia every way you can,"" Graham said. “It’s about time somebody looked into the connections of Ukraine.” WH TO RELEASE DOCUMENT SHOWING INTEL COMMUNITY WATCHDOG FOUND WHISTLEBLOWER HAD 'POLITICAL BIAS,' OFFICIAL SAYS Graham said, however, if the transcript from Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shows he “threatened to take aid away from Ukraine unless they investigate Biden” he would be disheartened. ""If the answer is yes, I’ll be on your show very disappointed with our president. If the answer is no, this is Russia times two, times 10,"" he said. Graham said he also wanted to know how the whistleblower found out about the conversation and if they had any bias for writing their complaint. “Was there a reason to withhold aid to this new Ukrainian administration until we knew who they were? Was it okay for President Trump to withhold money to try to get other countries to give more?” he added. He told Hannity the reason Democrats are trying to impeach Trump is because they don’t believe they can beat him in 2020. “If there’s no evidence that President Trump tried to coerce the Ukrainians into investigating Biden … then there’s nothing here,” he added. Graham extended an offer to the whistleblower to testify before Congress. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the launch a former impeachment inquiry Tuesday."
"True to form the President and his confederates are only adding to the chaos. In response to questioning from CNN's Chis Cuomo Thursday night, for example, Trump's personal lawyer and TV attack dog,  Rudolph Giuliani, both denied and confirmed  that the controversy may have to do with the fact that Giuliani has urged Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden is leading the pack of Democrats hoping to oppose Trump in 2020. Could it be that the President's lawyer is mixing politics and policy in an unsavory way?   As usual it's hard to follow the action, but what is known thus far should worry us all. According to various news outlets, the White House and Justice Department told the inspector general for intelligence matters there was nothing to the whistleblower's report that a high level official, most likely the President, communicated in some untoward way with a foreign leader. Under apparent pressure from the White House and Justice, the acting director of national intelligence blocked the intelligence IG from notifying Congress of the complaint, sidestepping a law requiring this. Now Capitol Hill leaders and the administration are battling over  just who has a right  to see the complaint. In a normal, pre-Trump Washington, the issue of such a complaint would have been handled in a routine, if not collegial, way. But in this era, when the White House stonewalls as a matter of course, such a conflict seems inevitable—and, too, that the President would act in a way so heedless that some intelligence professional would sound an alarm But this new crisis is completely in character for Trump, who has always operated as if personal relationships, and his self-interest, are all that really matter in every context. In every organization he has ever led, from his businesses in New York to the US government he has insisted on being the sole authority and expert, a man who ignored the rules as a matter of routine. During his decades as a real estate developer and entertainer,  Trump's style meant that he controlled  all of the many hundreds of entities under his organization's umbrella, and those who worked below him were charged with making sure his decisions -- whether good or bad -- turn out for the best, while he claimed credit for successes and dodged accountability for failures.  Then, and apparently now, Trump relied on his instinct, which often got him into big trouble. Multiple bankruptcies proved that Trump's decision-making gut is a less-than-perfect instrument. Upon examining his failures,  Susan Craig, of The New York Times, declared,  ""We found most of it was just bad business.""  As President, Trump has depended on unconventional operatives like Giuliani to help him in an unofficial capacity. For months Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, has been trying to stir up concerns about Biden and his son Hunter's involvement with a Ukrainian energy firm. An official in that country  told The Daily Beast  that Trump is seeking compromising information. Trump himself  has said ""it doesn't matter""  if the President of the United States is engaged in this slimy business. In comments to reporters Friday,  he added:  ""I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate.""    Hope for real clarity on the matter is dimmed by the fact that Trump enjoys rubber-stamp support from the Republican-controlled Senate, which has approved nearly all of his nominees for federal positions only to see  a record number leave their posts in short order.  Most recently Trump was forced to withdraw his nominee for the top job at the Federal Emergency Management Agency amid an FBI investigation. FEMA is part of the  Department of Homeland Security, where ""acting"" officials are found in striking numbers  at the top of the organizational chart.  ""Actings"" are running things across the administration. In fact, the director of national intelligence caught up in the latest mess, Joseph Maguire, is on temporary assignment and, therefore, lacking the gravitas of an appointee who really owns the job. Although officials who lack permanent status surely suffer for it, their insecurity seems to suit Trump's seat-of-the-pants style.  He has said he prefers provisional appointees  because they are more readily moved in and out of positions. They might also be assumed to be more vulnerable to whatever pressure the White House applied.  The downside, of course, is that ""acting"" leaders may struggle to get anything done or to win the respect of their troops. (Imagine, for example, an army going into battle under a general whose stars were applied with Velcro and whose orders are under constant presidential review.)      Indeed, Trump has spent his life making sure that those who serve him feel like they are never quite secure, while at the same time he has sought to make himself immune to examination. As President,  he has long banned note-takers  from some talks with foreign leaders and then limited White House reporting on his phone calls with them.  The current whistleblower controversy appears to be yet another case of Trump seeking ways to avoid accountability. The  Washington Post reported  that White House records indicate that that Trump had had ""conversations or interactions with at least five foreign leaders in the preceding five weeks"": Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani.  CNN reported Thursday that the White House and the Justice Department told the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that the nature of the whistleblower complaint isn't covered by laws governing intelligence whistleblowers.   According to CNN : ""Previously the White House has cited longstanding precedent in refusing congressional requests for documents related to Trump's meetings with his Russian counterpart. 'It is settled law that the Constitution entrusts the conduct of foreign relations exclusively to the Executive Branch, as it makes the President 'the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations,'  White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote in a letter to Democrats in May."" The President defends his secretive dealings with foreign leaders by insisting that America's international success depends on his personal rapport with them. He says he has great relationships with the likes of Putin, North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un, China' President Xi and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.   Russia, China, North Korea and Saudi Arabia have all caused trouble to America during the Trump era, and his brand of personal politics hasn't seemed to help any. Instead, it has reinforced the suspicions that many held toward Trump when he was just a self-promoting businessman. Back then, of course, his business was his business. Today, he acts on behalf of the American people. Earning their trust requires that he follow the rules.     "
"Vice President Mike Pence addresses President Trump's call to the Ukrainian president, whistleblower claims on 'Hannity.' Vice President Mike Pence  lit into the mainstream media over its coverage of the Ukraine controversy in an exclusive interview on "" Hannity ."" Critics have been relentless in their condemnation of  President Trump  over a whistleblower's complaint about the context of a phone call between the president and newly elected Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky -- while  ignoring allegations of unsubstantiated wrongdoing  by  former Vice President Joe Biden  and his son Hunter, Pence told  Sean Hannity. ""The ironic thing is is that everything that our critics in the media are leveling at the president from this phone call, and leveling at our administration, everything that Democrats on Capitol Hill are running off and describing -- Vice President Joe Biden bragged about -- which was a quid-pro-quo -- withholding American aid in exchange for a specific action,"" he claimed. Trump's conversation with Zelensky came as the Trump administration was holding up $250 million in military aid for Ukraine, money that the White House later released. The president has said he wanted European countries to pay more for their own defense, and  denied delaying any military aid funding. SOURCE SAYS WHISTLEBLOWER DIDN'T HAVE 'FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE' OF TRUMP CALL WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT Last week,  a whistleblower complaint surfaced  containing allegations  Trump  made a troubling and unspecified ""promise"" to a foreign leader later reported to be Zelensky -- touching off a Washington firestorm. On Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News the whistleblower  did not have “firsthand knowledge”  of the conversation. The whistleblower's allegation could, however, prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. The former vice president has explained on camera that in March 2016, he  privately threatened then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko  that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor wasn't fired. To that extent, Pence told Hannity all Americans should know the full account of both Bidens' relations with Kiev. ""The American people have a right to know what happened. They have a right to know what happened in 2016 and they have a right to know what the circumstances were around having a sitting vice president threaten to withhold American aid.""

""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And, they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

The comments from Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and longtime respected member of the Democratic caucus, come as  members of his party are increasingly calling for the House  to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump.

Congressional Democrats have been urging  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,  who has so far been reluctant to support impeachment proceedings, to change her mind on the issue in the wake of the Trump administration's decision to block the release to Congress of a whistleblower complaint. The July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which  Trump pressured the leader , according to a person familiar with the situation, was part of the complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or his son Hunter Biden. On Monday, Pelosi, a California Democrat, offered a fresh sign she's easing from her resistance during a brief interview with CNN, saying the House ""will have no choice"" but to ultimately initiate an impeachment inquiry.

In addition, Rove claimed Monday on "" The Story "" that the report the  whistleblower who brought the issue  to the forefront did not have ""firsthand knowledge"" of the call is an important development.

"Trump joined  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi   at a rally in Houston  attended by tens of thousands, many of whom were waving Indian flags as both leaders praised each other's work. Breaking away from the staid formality of meetings at the White House, Trump took the stage with Modi at an event dubbed ""Howdy, Modi!"" at NRG Stadium. Roughly 50,000 people -- many from the city's large Indian diaspora -- were registered to attend.     Trump credited the Indian-American community with ""helping to strengthen our country and build our future,"" citing its contributions to medicine, business and technology.  The President praised Modi's leadership and touted the ""stronger than ever before"" relationship with India. He said India ""has never had a better friend as President than President Donald Trump.""  Trump linked his concerns about security at the US-Mexico border with India's security concerns about its border with Pakistan. ""Both India and US also understand that to keep our communities safe, we must protect our borders,"" Trump said. The President addressed those affected by the serious flooding in Texas, and pledged the full support of his administration.  Modi praised Trump, calling him ""warm, friendly, accessible, energetic and full of wit.""  The Indian prime minister appealed directly to Trump's crowd-craving sensibilities with a large stadium event, giving Trump a rally setting where he tends to thrive and feel invigorated.  The rally gave Trump an opportunity to appeal to Indian-American voters in Harris County, which has been at the heart of Texas' gradual shift from reliably Republican to competitive battleground. Modi, who is set to attend the United Nations General Assembly this week, could help give Trump a bump in his battle for reelection.  On stage, Modi introduced Trump as India's ""true friend"" in the White House, and he invoked Trump in his signature campaign slogan, ""Ab ki baar, Modi sarkar,"" which translates to ""This time, Modi government."" On stage, Modi replaced his name with Trump's.  He commended the Trump administration for celebrating Diwali at the White House, and he invited Trump and his family to come to India.  Modi said he is ""certain that some positive developments"" will come out of upcoming talks at the UN. ""President Trump calls me the top negotiator but he himself is great at the 'Art of the deal' and I am learning a lot from him,"" he said.  The event was the first of two events on Sunday with foreign leaders in battleground states. After the rally, Trump flew to Wapakoneta, Ohio, to tour an Australian-owned cardboard manufacturing plant alongside Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who Trump feted with a state dinner on Friday. The events were an opportunity for both Modi and Morrison to show the US President they can deliver in ways that are especially appealing to Trump. In the critical battleground state of Ohio, Morrison was expected to demonstrate that his country is contributing to the US economy and creating manufacturing jobs as the two men tour a Pratt Industries manufacturing facility. The events come as Trump continues to  face questions about whether he pressured Ukraine's president  to investigate former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, while withholding military aid to the country. Trump has defended the call, dubbing criticism of it a ""Ukraine Witch Hunt,"" while Biden on Saturday  accused Trump of abusing the power of his presidency . There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump will cap off his Sunday travel with a flight to New York, where he will  address the United Nations General Assembly  later in the week and meet with world leaders on its sidelines."
"""I've read the complaint, and I've read the transcript of conversation with the President and the president of the Ukraine,"" Turner said during a House Intelligence Committee hearing with the acting director of national intelligence. ""Concerning that conversation, I want to say to the President: This is not OK. That conversation is not OK."" ""I think it's disappointing to the American public when they read the (conversation's) transcript,"" the Ohio Republican said. Turner's  critical comments add to a small but growing list  of remarks by Republicans who have expressed concern over a July 25 phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump pressured him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The conversation with Zelensky has led to a  House impeachment inquiry  into the President's actions, with Democrats claiming Trump abused his office by asking Ukraine to investigate his political opponent. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  As acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House panel on Thursday, many congressional Republicans told CNN that they hadn't yet read the complaint, which was released to the public earlier in the day.  Among them were Sens. James Lankford of Oklahoma and John Hoeven of North Dakota, who both said an appropriations meeting prevented them from reviewing the complaint.  A key standout is Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who said Wednesday he saw  ""some very troubling things""  in reading the White House transcript of the Trump-Zelensky conversation. On Sunday, Romney tweeted ""if the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out."""
"The question this week is whether the President and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, abused the power of the executive office to  pressure Ukraine  into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, who remains a top-tier candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, making him a political rival of the President.    Reports of Trump's conversations with the Ukrainian president come as a whistleblower from the intelligence community has  filed an official complaint  with the inspector general related to the call, a person familiar with the matter tells CNN.    The inspector general concluded that the whistleblower complaint was ""credible"" and ""urgent"" — a level of seriousness that requires the Justice Department to notify Congress. The IG followed this protocol by forwarding the whistleblower's report to Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, who has  refused  to share it with Congress. On Monday,  Trump  laid into the government whistleblower, questioning the person's nationality and suggested that it is anti-American to report suspected abuses by a president.    In short, the executive branch is blocking the whistleblower's information from getting to Congress, even though the law is clear that such notification is mandatory in cases of this sort. For his part, the IG says the executive branch is  keeping him  from doing his job.    Only two months have passed since Special Counsel Robert Mueller appeared before Congress, concluding a nearly two-year-long investigation into whether members of the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Although many people have gone to prison over charges stemming from the  special counsel's probe , no one was ultimately charged with conspiracy with Russia, despite at least  one documented attempt  by Team Trump to accept political dirt from a foreign adversary.    During the course of Mueller's investigation, the President and his allies engaged in a full-throated assault on the institutions of power that were investigating Trump's inner circle, working to discredit the men and women charged with safeguarding America against foreign threats.    As I write in my new book, ""Crossfire Hurricane: Inside Donald Trump's War on the FBI,"" the President  blamed investigators  for conducting a ""witch hunt,"" and for being ""deep state"" operatives working to undermine his presidency. Without evidence, he claimed the FBI had inserted a ""spy"" into his campaign for sinister political purposes and castigated former President Barack Obama for allegedly ordering the  wiretapping  of Trump Tower.    Many national security experts, including me, believe Trump's goal in these baseless attacks was to help soften the blow of whatever might eventually come from Mueller's findings.    In the latest scandal, involving Trump's dealings with Ukraine, the President is drawing from the same playbook he used in his earlier attacks against the intelligence community: initially claim no knowledge of allegations of wrongdoing, eventually deny those allegations, claim that whatever was originally being described was actually innocent, and then wage war against those doing the investigating.  During the Russia investigation, Trump and his allies insisted that Mueller and his team were partisan operatives with an agenda, even though the key players involved in that case -- Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, FBI Director James Comey, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and even Mueller himself -- were  all Republicans .   President Trump has already started muddying the waters in the latest Ukrainian scandal, publicly blasting the whistleblower as a "" partisan ,"" even though Trump admitted in the same setting that he doesn't know who the person is. The president  denied  knowing which phone call media reports were even referring to, and then minutes later described the same call as having been ""beautiful."" And, of course, he has returned to a familiar lexicon, labeling the latest incident as "" the Ukraine witch hunt .""    As I have tried to warn the public ever since Trump's initial attacks on the FBI and Justice Department during the Russia probe, the President's efforts to undermine our institutions of justice pose real consequences to public safety. For example, FBI agents and intelligence officers rely on the public to help gather leads and serve as informants. A lack of public trust might mean fewer people will come forward to help guard against threats.    Furthermore, US intelligence agencies have the life-and-death responsibility of advising policymakers on serious threats to US national security. Political attacks on these agencies' credibility will only serve to undermine their effectiveness in the eyes of lawmakers and the public they serve.  If any president destroys that precious trust with the American people for nefarious political purposes, that president risks undermining democracy.    Trump may be lashing out because he has been backed into a corner, but publicly degrading people inside the intelligence community because their good-faith efforts threaten his political survival is no excuse for the war he wages.    As I write in my book, we have seen real intelligence abuses in the past. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the FBI and CIA engaged in gross violations of civil liberties in the name of national security. Innocent Americans were wiretapped without court authorization and spied on, as intelligence bureaus sought to determine their national and political allegiances.    What followed was systematic and wholesale reformative change by lawmakers once these abuses came to light. Congress passed  new laws  rein in the intelligence community and ensure effective oversight by the legislative branch. The distrust in intelligence and law enforcement in the wake of those scandals has taken decades to reverse.    If President Trump is successful at convincing his base that the intelligence community today is still untrustworthy, he will succeed in undermining these critical institutions in a way that might take a generation to repair.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s mood went from feisty to self-pitying to deflated on Wednesday as he fended off questions about  a July phone call  in which he urged the president of Ukraine to work with Attorney General William P. Barr on potential corruption investigations connected to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Democratic rival. Although Mr. Trump sought to present a business-as-usual image in his annual trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly — by highlighting a trade deal with Japan, among other things — his anger and anxiousness took over his day, aides said. He appeared aggrieved in comments to reporters ahead of a meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, but by late afternoon, Mr. Trump appeared so exhausted that he spoke unusually slowly at a rambling news conference meant to sum up his trip at the United Nations. He opened by naming 28 countries whose leaders he had met with and said that, unfortunately, reporters were far more interested in his phone call with Mr. Zelensky. “I’ve been up from early in the morning until late in the evening and meeting with different countries, all for the good of our country,” Mr. Trump said. “And the press doesn’t even cover all of this.” Then he moved on to the call, and the words he said spoke to the Ukrainian president. “They were perfect,” Mr. Trump said. “They were all perfect.” He added: “I didn’t threaten anybody. In fact, the press was asking questions of the president of Ukraine, and he said, no pressure. I used the word pressure, and I think he used the word push, but he meant pressure, but it’s the same thing. No push, no pressure, no nothing. It is all a hoax, folks. It is all a big hoax.” The president went so far as to suggest that his enemies had intentionally sabotaged his excellent adventure in Manhattan. “So that was all planned like everything else,” Mr. Trump said. “It was all planned. And the witch hunt continues.” Aides who had lived through the day-to-day nerves of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for roughly two years had thought the worst was behind them. But they said the growing storm around their boss’s call with Mr. Zelensky drove home the new reality that an impeachment inquiry would consume the next months. Although several of the president’s allies sought to play down the contents of the  reconstructed transcript of the call  released Wednesday, two people close to Mr. Trump said that the transcript matched what they knew of his dealings on the phone with world leaders. One former senior official called it the typical playbook: Engage in flattery, discuss mutual cooperation and bring up a favor that then could be delegated to another person on Mr. Trump’s team. At the White House, a grim sense of frustration has set in. Aides said they thought Democrats had gone too far. Nonetheless, they acknowledged that the impeachment inquiry represented the likely death of any hope of passing legislation in the next 13 months. Several expressed fear that other witnesses would come forward in relation to Mr. Trump’s contacts with the Ukrainian president, or that other whistle-blowers on other matters would emerge. The White House counsel’s office is prepared for an impeachment inquiry, but other departments in the West Wing are badly depleted by staff departures and plagued by exhaustion. In the morning, White House officials briefed about a dozen Republican members of the House and Senate on the reconstructed call, providing them with talking points. Mr. Trump called into the meeting as the members sat around a table in the Roosevelt Room, insisting it was a hoax and that Democrats had gone overboard in pursuing him, people briefed on the meeting said. Some of Mr. Trump’s allies said he saw impeachment as a good political opportunity that would result in a backlash against the Democrats. At the same time, several people close to Mr. Trump said he did not want to be the third president in American history, after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, to be impeached. Some Trump allies — including Newt Gingrich, who served as the Republican House speaker during the Clinton impeachment — saw an upside. Mr. Gingrich, an occasional Trump adviser, said in an interview that an impeachment inquiry would lead to further questioning into the Biden family’s financial and political activities abroad. “Nancy Pelosi ended Joe Biden’s campaign, and she doesn’t even realize it,” Mr. Gingrich said in an interview. “The Democrats will run further into a cul-de-sac chanting ‘impeachment’ as a policy.” Of the Clinton impeachment, he said that “it was to our disadvantage politically,” adding that  regular voters  grew frustrated with a focus on impeachment over matters like the economy. Anger from some current and former administration officials was directed at Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s longtime friend and personal lawyer, who had repeatedly told Mr. Trump that he believed Ukraine was involved in the 2016 election interference, a notion the president fixated on. The aides believe that Mr. Giuliani, eager to land something that would please Mr. Trump, had gotten too far out on a limb. And they cringed at  his television appearances . Throughout the day, Mr. Trump asked people if they had read the reconstruction of the phone call that the White House had released, and he asked their opinions of it. He said he did not think it was that bad for him, and he described it as an act of transparency. At a fund-raiser on Wednesday night in New York — at the Upper East Side home of John Paulson, a hedge fund manager — Mr. Trump gamely told jokes and tried to seem lighthearted, attendees said. But several people who spoke with him said he seemed distracted and anxious. The president had had little chance to catch up with his media coverage at the United Nations, but aides said they were bracing for the president to react angrily when he finally saw some of it after the fund-raiser."
"Expect more impulsive gestures from the commander-in-chief -- for instance, summits with dictators like North Korea's  Kim Jong Un  -- to bolster his standing at home. Trade adversaries like  China  will smell blood, demanding concessions to unlock ""deals"" Trump can say he struck. A discombobulated White House might take its eye off hotspots like the  South China Sea  -- or it could be tempted into military adventurism abroad -- perhaps with  Iran  -- to wag the dog. America's Congress is not known for productivity in the best of times; when impeachment poisons relations on Capitol Hill, it will grind to a halt. That's bad news for Mexico, Canada, and Japan, who need trade deals ratified. It's especially bad news for post-Brexit Britain, whose economic eggs are in Trump's basket.

""Nobody pushed me"" After uproar over an earlier phone call mushroomed into an impeachment drama, Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday in New York City. On the sidelines on the United Nations General Assembly -- the comedian-turned-president's debut at the gathering of global leaders -- Zelensky offered the quote that Trump most wanted. ""Nobody pushed me,"" he said. Trump, keen to show he had not forced Kiev into investigating Joe Biden, quickly jumped in. ""There was no pressure,"" he said, turning to reporters and adding, ""You know there was no pressure. I appreciate the answer."" Read the transcript at the center of the drama  here .  The president from TV Trauma seemed to spread across the face of Ukraine's President during his meeting with Trump -- just after the US President suggested he work more with  Vladimir Putin , who invaded Ukraine and claimed a chunk five years ago.  The bullied ex-Soviet republic is desperate for America's help, but its hopes for Western assistance to a better future often flounder in the No Man's Land of post-Cold War relations. Now, Trump is suspected of temporarily holding up $400 million in military aid to Ukraine, while asking for a political favor. The sum would have been a drop in the bucket for America and the billionaire President, who requested $639 billion in defense spending for 2018. But for Ukraine it was a lifeline to counter Russian aggression.  No wonder Zelensky so obsequiously flattered Trump in their notorious July 25 phone call, which one Democrat dubbed a ""classic mob shakedown."" Trump says there was ""no quid pro quo,"" but even if that's the case, his request for an investigation into Joe Biden must have been an agonizing moment for the rookie President, who ran on an anti-corruption platform and whose only experience before being elected was playing a president on TV. As they met before reporters here in New York, Trump treated Zelensky as a defense witness, making sure it was clear that he said he hadn't been pressured go after Biden. He also couldn't resist pointing out that Russia's annexation of Crimea fell on Barack Obama's watch, and that a Ukrainian won the Miss Universe pageant when he owned it. The contrast between Trump's parochial and personal concerns and Ukraine's existential angst was stark. It's no laughing matter for Zelensky and the heads of other states looking to the United States for geopolitical support. ""The server, they say Ukraine has it""  Also revealed in the transcript of Trump's call was his  request that Kiev ""find out what happened""  with a company called Crowdstrike and ""the server."" What Trump means is not clear, but references to a missing server are common among some US political conspiracy theorists. In brief:  Crowdstrike is a publicly traded US cybersecurity firm that has been hired by Democrats and Republicans. In 2016, it was hired by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to investigate a hack into DNC servers. CrowdStrike concluded that Russia had engineered the cyberattack, and US special counsel Robert Mueller later confirmed this. Trump has rejected the notion that Russia was responsible, and asked why the DNC hired Crowdstrike to investigate instead of directly giving its servers to the FBI. No particular DNC server has been publicly identified as missing, particularly suspicious, or in Ukraine. 275 gigatons Expect to hear this number at CNN Democratic debate, as candidates offer their climate credentials. That's  how much Greenland's ice sheet lost  annually on average from 2006 to 2015.

"Trump also made a confusing apparent reference to a conspiracy theory about CrowdStrike, the American cybersecurity firm that investigated the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee. The claim about Biden According to a  White House transcript released Wednesday , Trump said to Zelensky during a phone call in July: ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it...It sounds horrible to me."" Facts First:   Joe Biden did not brag that he stopped any prosecution. Rather, he bragged that he had successfully pressured the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor who was widely criticized for failing to bring corruption prosecutions. Trump's suggestion was that Biden had boasted of stopping the ""prosecution"" of the business dealings of Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of a company, Burisma Holdings, for which his son Hunter Biden sat on the board of directors. But there was no actual prosecution of Zlochevsky or Burisma -- just an investigation that had not produced any prosecutions and that does not seem to have been pursued vigorously. There is no evidence Joe Biden ever tried to thwart this investigation, much less that he boasted about doing so. What Biden said Joe Biden, the administration's point man on the Ukraine file, pressured Ukrainian leaders to fire prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had faced international criticism for what was seen as an unwillingness to prosecute elite corruption. Shokin, hired in 2015, was fired in 2016. Biden bragged about the saga  at an event in January 2018 , recounting how he had threatened to withhold a billion-dollar US loan guarantee to Ukraine if Shokin was not removed. At no point during Biden's story did he mention the investigation into Zlochevsky or Burisma. Further, there is no sign that Biden did anything to impede the investigation -- which may not even have been active at the time. Vitaliy Kasko, a former deputy prosecutor who resigned from Shokin's office in February 2016, alleging that the office was itself corrupt,  told Bloomberg  this year that the investigation was dormant by the time of Joe Biden's intervention. Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Center,  told the Washington Post  for a July article that ""Shokin was not investigating."" In a 2015 speech, the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, blasted ""corrupt actors within the Prosecutor General's Office"" for working against anti-corruption efforts. One example Pyatt cited: the office's refusal to assist in a United Kingdom  investigation into Zlochevsky .  The claim about CrowdStrike According to the document released by the White House, Trump also said to Zelensky: ""I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike...I guess you have one of your wealthy people...The server, they say Ukraine has it."" (The ellipses are in the White House document.) It's not entirely clear what Trump meant, but some inferences can be made based on his previous remarks. CrowdStrike isn't Ukrainian, but Trump has said it is. CrowdStrike is a respected and  publicly traded US cybersecurity firm  that has been  hired by Democrats and Republicans . One of the company's senior executives previously had a  lengthy career at the FBI . And one of its co-founders, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a prominent think tank in Washington. Alperovitch was born in the Soviet Union, in what is now Russia, then emigrated with his family to the US. It isn't clear who Trump was referring to when he mentioned ""one of your wealthy people,"" but in a 2017  interview with the Associated Press , he said he has heard CrowdStrike ""is Ukrainian-based."" It was not then and it is not now.  ""I heard it's owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that's what I heard,"" Trump added in that 2017 interview, though, again, it is not and was not. It is possible Trump was alluding to a very vague conspiracy theory involving wealthy Ukrainian businessman  Viktor Pinchuk , a financial supporter of the Atlantic Council, where, again, Alperovitch is a senior fellow. There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Pinchuk. CrowdStrike and the DNC Trump did not specify to Zelensky what he meant by ""the server,"" but he has repeatedly complained about how the Democratic National Committee and the FBI handled a hack into DNC servers in 2016.The DNC hired CrowdStrike in 2016 to investigate the hack. After conducting an investigation, CrowdStrike publicly blamed the Russian government for the hack -- a finding later confirmed by special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Trump and his Republican allies have  fomented conspiracy theories  about the hack since 2016. Trump has publicly rejected overwhelming evidence that Russia was the country responsible. And he has  repeatedly questioned  why the DNC hired CrowdStrike to investigate the breach instead of handing its servers over to the FBI for direct examination. There is no evidence to support the conspiracies about the DNC servers. But by withholding the servers from the FBI, Democrats created a talking point for Republicans, who have claimed that the DNC was hiding something. Former FBI director James Comey, who led the early phases of the Russia investigation,  testified in 2017  that it would have been better if the DNC gave the servers to the FBI, but that the FBI was able to get the forensic information it needed from CrowdStrike. Mueller later  brought detailed criminal charges  against Russian hackers for their involvement in the hacks. CrowdStrike said in a statement on Wednesday: ""With regards to our investigation of the DNC hack in 2016, we provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI. As we've stated before, we stand by our findings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the US Intelligence community."" Just this week, a federal judge rejected efforts by Trump ally Roger Stone to force the Justice Department to share unredacted versions of the reports CrowdStrike gave to the FBI.  Stone is facing charges  of lying and obstruction and has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers previously put forward some of the same theories that Trump has been pushing.  The judge was not swayed .

"White House provides unredacted text of President Trump's phone call with Ukraine's new leader Volodymyr Zelensky. As a  political war raged in Washington  over  President Trump ’s controversial call with Ukraine’s leader in which he apparently sought a probe concerning the Biden family, another battle broke out Wednesday -- over the format of the ""transcript"" of the call itself. The White House on Wednesday released a document detailing the president’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, showing he indeed sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country, though did not explicitly tie the request to U.S. aid. UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER – BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID But with virtually every aspect of this controversy being disputed, even the format of the document was challenged. The concerns focused on a notation on the document saying it does not represent a ""verbatim transcript"" but is based on ""notes and recollections"" of those listening and memorializing the call. This detail was seized upon by critics to challenge its accuracy, though the administration maintained the document is reliable. ""Trump committed a crime. The White House just gave us proof of a crime. But we think there's more,"" a Democratic aide told Fox News. ""The question is, what are they hiding? This wasn't a full transcript, so how bad is this whole thing?"" New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that “what they are calling a ‘transcript’ isn’t even a transcript. It’s a collection of notes.” “This is what they are *admitting* to and it’s way above and beyond what is necessary for impeachment,” Ocasio-Cortez said. Journalists also pushed back against it: “We have to refrain from calling it a verbatim transcript,” tweeted Brian Karem, the Playboy writer and CNN contributor. However, the Trump administration is defending the accuracy of the document. A senior Department of Justice official told Fox News that DOJ officials interviewed knowledgeable people about the process for creating the transcript and are confident the document is accurate. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News has learned it reflects the standard process for documenting calls with foreign leaders. It is essentially a compilation of what two Situation Room officers wrote down while listening in on the call in real time. A source familiar with the White House Situation Room staff confirmed that the two transcribers who listened in on Trump’s call are CIA employees detailed to the White House from the agency. What the White House is calling a “transcript” is as close to a verbatim readout of this call as exists. An audio recording of the call itself does not exist, as the policy of the Situation Room is that head of state calls are not typically recorded. The document, declassified by Trump on Tuesday as Democrats are  pressing forward with impeachment , indicates that the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25. “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call, according to the rough transcript. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.” This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention. Fox News’ Catherine Herridge, Jake Gibson, Brooke Singman and Brian Flood contributed to this report."
"DES MOINES — Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is the new Iowa polling leader, narrowly in first place ahead of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to a new poll of the state from  The Des Moines Register and CNN . The poll showed that Ms. Warren was the first choice for 22 percent of would-be Democratic caucusgoers, a significant increase from the 15 percent support she held in June,  when The Register last polled the state . Mr. Biden dropped from a first-place June showing of 24 percent to 20 percent.  The result left the two in a statistical tie, well ahead of the rest of the pack. The poll is the latest evidence of Ms. Warren’s political rise in the 2020 race. Alone among the 2020 candidates, her campaign stops have become bona fide events, with 20,000 people attending a speech in Manhattan this week and 2,000 turning out in Iowa City on Thursday night. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont placed third with 11 percent, the second consecutive poll from The Register in which his campaign has seen precipitous decreases in support. Mr. Sanders, who placed in a statistical tie with Hillary Clinton in the state’s 2016 contest, had 25 percent support in the paper’s March poll and 16 percent support in June.  Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., placed fourth in The Register’s poll, with 9 percent. He had 14 percent in The Register’s June poll and has fallen in other surveys of the state since then before launching a television advertising campaign here after Labor Day. The gains by Ms. Warren come largely at the expense of Mr. Sanders. His polling drop-off comes as his campaign has reordered staff in early nominating states in an effort to reboot his campaign.  Senator Kamala Harris of California was fifth overall with 6 percent support. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota each had 3 percent support. Four candidates were the first choice of 2 percent of likely Iowa caucusgoers.  In addition to leading the field, Ms. Warren also has the most room for growth in the field — 71 percent of Democrats surveyed said she was their first or second choice or they were open to backing her,  the poll found . Mr. Biden was next, being considered by 60 percent of Iowa Democrats. Of the rest of the field, only Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Harris were being considered by more than half the Democratic electorate.  The dynamics are far from set: Just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers said their minds were made up, and 63 percent said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. The poll surveyed 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers by telephone Sept. 14-18, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. It was released after 17 Democratic presidential candidates appeared Saturday at the Polk County Steak Fry, an annual political event that drew 12,000 activists and voters to a Des Moines park for several hours of political speeches, campaign singalongs and freshly grilled meats. The poll, like the Steak Fry event, illustrated the increasingly condensed nature of the 2020 Democratic presidential contest. The poll found just five candidates registering more than 3 percent support, while those who braved the drizzling conditions and threat of thunderstorms congregated around the candidates who emerged hours later atop the polls. The event’s largest applause came for Ms. Warren, who repeated a forceful call for President Trump’s impeachment, and Mr. Buttigieg, who was followed by a yellow-clad cadre of highly enthusiastic supporters. Mr. Biden, whose campaign purchased the largest allotment of Steak Fry tickets, entered the event with a marching band and scores of campaign aides and volunteers. The lower-polling contenders for the most part roamed the grounds of  Water Works  Park here unencumbered. Mr. Biden was not the only candidate bringing some flash to the event. Supporters of the former housing secretary Julián Castro danced to a mariachi band, backers of former Representative Beto O’Rourke pushed a boat out into the nearby lake, Ms. Warren took 1,050 selfies and Ms. Klobuchar blasted the music of Prince, a  Minnesota hero.  For some, the event may mark one of their last major appearances in the state. Mr. Booker sent out a plea to donors today saying that unless he raises $1.7 million over the next 10 days, he will be unable to remain in the race. He’s not alone in being in danger of running out of cash."
"WASHINGTON — Oddly, it has been business as usual on the campaign trail this week. Senator  Elizabeth Warren  explained her policy plans to voters in New Hampshire on Wednesday, Senator  Bernie Sanders  walked a picket line with striking auto workers in Detroit and former Vice President  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  courted donors in Bel Air, Calif., and went on Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night TV show. But behind the scenes, many of the  2020 Democratic candidates  have been grappling with a new reality: For the first time, a presidential primary will unfold with a sitting president seeking re-election while also facing an impeachment inquiry. There is no political playbook for this. No pollster or strategist to speak from experience. What is clear, from interviews with advisers and allies with the various campaigns, is that the top candidates like Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren believe they are sufficiently established in the race that they can continue to command attention for their candidacies and messages. Second-tier and third-tier candidates, however, are at much greater risk of falling off the radar screen for an electorate that may soon be at a standstill, distracted by an impeachment circus in Washington. “This is a nuclear bomb dropped in the middle of the race and it’s going to change the dynamics for everyone,” said Jared Leopold, an aide to Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who dropped out of the race several weeks ago. “You can’t go on pretending it was like it was a week ago.” “It scrambles the playing field,” he added. The political intensity surrounding impeachment was on vivid display at a private Biden fund-raiser on Thursday afternoon in California, where Mr. Biden said that Mr. Trump had tried to “hijack the election” by asking the president of Ukraine to help undertake a corruption investigation against the former vice president and his son, Hunter Biden.    “He’d like to get foreign help to win elections,” Mr. Biden said. The stark new reality for the Democratic haves and have-nots is rooted in the bifurcated political landscape of the  2020 campaign . For months, it has played out on cable television, where some candidates have been able to convert appearances into polling bumps and  greater fund-raising . It has also played out on the campaign trail, where candidates have tried to catch fire with voters by talking about rising prescription drug bills, child care costs and student debt burdens. For weeks ahead, if not months, cable shows will be so crowded with news and analysis of impeachment that only the top Democrats may have a guaranteed shot at getting on the airwaves. And in places like Iowa and New Hampshire, it may become harder for lower-polling candidates to get attention and break through there, too, amid the ongoing focus on Washington. “These hearings are going to be taking place while the primary contests are unfolding,” Matt Barreto, a co-founder of the polling firm Latino Decisions, said. “There’s going to be wall-to-wall coverage of impeachment, how do they find space to talk about Medicare for all, immigration reform or criminal justice reform?” On Wednesday, as new revelations about Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine unfolded on cable news, strategists, aides and allies on lower-polling campaigns cracked dark jokes about their futures, privately worrying that an expected nonstop news media focus on impeachment could be fatal for their campaigns. More than a dozen candidates have staked their presidential bids on a breakout moment that has not yet happened, one they argue could come if Mr. Biden falters. With Mr. Biden and his son at the center of the impeachment drama, Ms. Warren ascendant and the nation’s attention focused on what happens with Mr. Trump, the path for everyone else vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination just got a lot harder. The new normal may be campaign stunts like the almost-all-access bus tour Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., took reporters on this week in Iowa, dubbed the “ Live Tweet Express ” by Politico for the real-time chronicling reporters did of its exploits. Making matters worse for candidates who have seen their fund-raising pace slow dramatically since the end of June, the House’s turn toward impeachment comes in the last week of the quarter, just days before a Sept. 30 deadline that, for several candidates, will serve as the latest marker of their financial viability. In the last 48 hours, there have been signs that candidates other than Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren are beginning to recalibrate their strategies to keep their campaigns relevant.  Mr. Sanders, who for decades has refused to allow current events to alter his campaign strategy, held a rare news conference Tuesday in Davenport, Iowa, hours before the formal impeachment inquiry was announced. He provided a revealing glimpse into the two sides of impeachment for the candidates, castigating Mr. Trump for committing what he believed were “impeachable offenses” while also pulling back and acknowledging that impeachment proceedings posed political risks for both sides. “This is a complicated issue from a political point of view,” he said. Senator  Cory Booker  of New Jersey, who on Saturday launched a fund-raising drive that his campaign manager said was critical to his staying in the race, appeared Tuesday night on the same MSNBC program with Senator  Kamala Harris  of California — a demotion for two candidates who typically headline their own shows. The next morning Mr. Booker appeared on “Fox and Friends” for the first time as a presidential candidate, talking about impeachment on the president’s favorite morning news show — an apparent attempt to draw himself into Mr. Trump’s Twitter-based news cycles. Overwhelming numbers of Democrats nationwide support impeachment, with nearly three-quarters backing the House moving forward,  according to a Quinnipiac University poll  released Wednesday morning. Yet, the topic has not gained primary candidates much traction on the campaign trail. In part, that is because impeachment is not a distinguishing issue; all the leading candidates support moving forward with an impeachment investigation. “There’s an underlying stipulation that Trump should be impeached and the Democratic candidates all agree on that point,” said Geoff Garin, a pollster working for Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC. “So questions about that don’t help voters sort out one candidate from the other.” Democratic officials and strategists say primary voters are more eager to hear about the issues that directly impact their lives, like health care, immigration and the economy. “When we knock on doors the thing we hear about most is health care costs,” Ben Wikler, chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, said. “There’s a sense that Washington and the Trump administration are spinning out of control but what’s agonizing about that to voters is they have actual problems in their lives.” The only exception may be Mr. Biden, who finds his family at the center of Mr. Trump’s attacks, which continued in a Wednesday news conference carried by all the major broadcast and cable networks — though  MSNBC cut away early . Some of Mr. Biden’s advisers and allies are aware that Mr. Trump’s focus on Mr. Biden’s son Hunter and his business dealings in Ukraine carries  potential risk for him.  Yet they also believe that Mr. Biden is at his strongest when he is challenging Mr. Trump over American values and the direction of the nation, rather than relitigating his past, and his verbal gaffes, with his Democratic rivals. The new impeachment focus offers the former vice president an opportunity to draw direct contrasts with Mr. Trump at a time when many Democrats are inclined to be protective of Mr. Biden, aides and allies say. They also argue that Mr. Trump’s focus on Mr. Biden suggests the president is worried about Mr. Biden’s candidacy, a message the Biden campaign has reinforced through fund-raising appeals. “It reminds him of when he was young and had a stuttering problem and dealt with bullies then,” said Representative Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana Democrat who is a national co-chairman of Mr. Biden’s campaign. “And he’s dealing with bullies now.” But it may be Ms. Warren who most benefits from the timing of the impeachment inquiry. It comes just as she was beginning to receive increased scrutiny from her rivals and the press over her opaque answers on health care policy. Impeachment swings the news pendulum back to one of Ms. Warren’s strengths — in April she was the first top-tier candidate to call for impeaching Mr. Trump, a move that helped infuse her  then-listing campaign with momentum that has yet to slow down. Impeachment may also serve to shield Ms. Warren from fresh attacks from her Democratic rivals seeking to take aim at someone who has overtaken Mr. Biden atop some early-state polling. With the news media focused on impeachment, attacking Ms. Warren over an issue like health care may be like shouting into a void, aides to rival candidates said. “Impeachment is good news for Elizabeth Warren,” Jeff Link, a longtime Democratic strategist, said. “If everything gets frozen, she’s either at the top or near the top.” The impeachment drama does not appear likely to force any dramatic recalibration of Ms. Warren’s campaign. Unlike most of her rivals, she is not starving for attention. “It is time for impeachment now,” Ms. Warren told a crowd Wednesday night in Keene, N.H. “I’m glad to see that the House has stepped up, and I hope we do this,   and I hope we do it quickly.” She then went back to her  stump speech.

"New Jersey Democrat Sen. Cory Booker says Speaker Nancy Pelosi's formal impeachment inquiry is not about politics, it's about patriotism. BEDFORD, NH –  Democratic presidential candidate  Sen. Cory Booker  slammed President Trump on Thursday, calling President Trump’s urging the Ukraine leader to investigate the Biden family “despicable behavior.” The  Democrat from New Jersey  also termed “the revelations” from the whistleblower in  the Ukraine controversy  “explosive.” BOOKER DODGES QUESTIONS ABOUT BIDEN'S UKRAINE TIES But Booker emphasized that even though “we are in a constitutionally challenging moment” with an impeachment inquiry in Congress underway, he didn’t believe the White House race would become all about the Trump presidency. Booker spoke with reporters following a campaign event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire soon after an unclassified version of the complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower was released by the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday morning. The unidentified whistleblower claimed that White House officials who listened to the call in July between the president and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky were ""deeply disturbed"" by Trump's requests that Zelensky investigate unsubstantiated allegations against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Biden’s son, Hunter, served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company owned by one of the country’s oligarchs while Biden served in then-President Obama’s administration. The then-vice president pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at that company. The prosecutor – who also had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE UKRAINE CONTROVERSY The president on Thursday called the whistleblower report “another fake news story” and “another witch hunt” by the Democrats. Booker claimed that the president was using “the highest office in the land.. for his own personal political agenda” and emphasized that “we are seeing evidence of that in this whistleblower report.” And he spotlighted that “clearly there's more work to be done. There needs to be a thorough investigation.” An optimistic Booker predicted that the Republican-controlled Senate “will investigate as well…there’s already been shown some good bipartisan efforts to get to the truth.” Slamming congressional Democrats, Trump on Thursday charged “they’re going to tie up our country. We can’t talk about gun regulation. We can’t talk about anything. Frankly they’re so tied up. They so screwed up. Nothing gets done.”

       But Booker – while acknowledging that “there’s gonna be a lot of wind sucked off the sails” – added, “do not underestimate the ability for us to get things done in Washington when…we start to build relationships to get things done.” Booker, emphasizing that the presidential election needed to be more than just about Trump, told Fox News “Americans are far more sophisticated… the United States is in peril, because of corruption. But we can also deal with other issues.” Fox News' Peter Doocy contributed to this report Tara Prindiville contributed to this report."
"The video included a  compilation of news clips  from Romney's 2012 general election loss to Barack Obama paired with clips of Trump's own 2016 presidential election win over Hillary Clinton.  Earlier Monday, Romney told reporters he believes a transcript of the President's conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, should be released. ""Understanding exactly what he said would be very helpful I think to determine whether the allegations, which are quite serious, are allegations that will have consequence,"" he said.  On Friday, CNN reported Trump pressed Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.  Trump on Sunday acknowledged that he discussed Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper, including  that he threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine  unless the country's leaders did his bidding and investigated the Bidens. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Romney also signaled interest in the administration making public the initial whistleblower complaint, saying, ""I think it'd be very helpful to get to the bottom of the facts to follow the law to get us there. That would include the whistleblower as well as the transcript of the conversation."" White House  officials are now considering releasing a transcript of the call , multiple sources have told CNN, amid mounting scrutiny over the interaction. Still, some senior administration officials, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, are against the idea because of the precedent releasing it could set with future foreign leaders. Trump has suggested he hoped to release a transcript of his conversation. Romney's comments Monday come after he tweeted Sunday that it ""would be troubling in the extreme"" if Trump did pressure Ukraine's president to investigate Biden, the President's potential 2020 Democratic opponent. ""If the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,"" he wrote. Before joining the Senate, Romney penned an op-ed in  The Washington Post  assailing Trump for not rising to ""the mantle of the office"" and distinguishing himself as a GOP lawmaker willing to criticize the President.   ""A president should demonstrate the essential qualities of honesty and integrity, and elevate the national discourse with comity and mutual respect,"" Romney wrote at the time. ""And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring."""
"President Trump and others put increased pressure on Democratic presidential rivals; Kristin Fisher reports from Washington. An article in the  Washington Post  this week was widely mocked for comparing Democratic  2020 presidential  hopeful  Sen. Elizabeth Warren  to historical icon Frederick Douglass -- over the way they posed for photos. WaPo reporter Hannah Natanson began her piece by pointing out that 19th century abolitionist Douglass (1818-1895) ""appears alone in almost every photograph, staring down the camera in isolated, thoughtful splendor,"" while Warren ""features today in countless iPhone photos and Instagram feeds, her arm around voter after voter, always bearing the same wide grin."" ""The two are separated by race, gender and more than 100 years of history that forged an America that would probably be unrecognizable to Douglass,"" Nathanson wrote. ""Still, experts say, their use of photography collapses the distance: Douglass sat for scores of pictures to normalize the idea of black excellence and equality, and Warren’s thousands of selfies with supporters could do the same for a female president."" WARREN GETS STUMPED BY COLBERT WHEN PRESSED ON MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES TO FUND MEDICARE-FOR-ALL The piece goes on to cite professors who support the comparison presented by Natanson that both Warren and Douglass were ""smashing stereotypes."" “She’s presenting a public image of herself as somebody who is presidential,” Columbia University professor Alexander Alberro said. “What Douglass tried to do was to create a public persona in the face of the negative type of image of African Americans at the time … so I think the comparison is really good.” Louisiana State University professor Nichole Bauer suggested that even if Warren goes on to defeat in 2020, her ""million selfies are just a little bit more of a crack in that glass ceiling.” Still, the comparison raised many eyebrows on social media. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Journalist Jordan Chariton went even further, accusing The Washington Post of ""propping up"" Warren and ""defeating"" her progressive opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. ""Just when you think @washingtonpost can't get anymore absurd in their campaign to prop up @ewarren (and defeat @BernieSanders), they are now comparing Warren taking selfies with people to......Frederick Douglass,"" Chariton tweeted."
"""Look, my position remains the same. I think impeachment would be terribly divisive for our already very divided country,"" Gabbard said in an interview with CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""I think Congress needs to exercise oversight over the information that's been leaked. I think it's important this transcript is released to Congress so that Congress can do its job."" The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, in the past, has  cautioned against  impeaching Trump. Her comments on Tuesday came shortly before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  announced a formal impeachment inquiry  into the President. ""The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said in doing so. Trump faces outrage over reports that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son, Hunter. Trump on Sunday said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Zelensky -- at a time when the country was awaiting the aid package from the United States -- but he denied doing anything improper. The call is also the subject of a whistleblower complaint. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. House Democrats'  calls for impeachment have grown louder  amid the growing controversy, and seven freshman Democrats wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post calling for an impeachment inquiry. When asked why she thought those lawmakers were wrong, Gabbard said she thinks it's important that the transcript of the conversations are released and Congress makes a ""decision based on the facts."" ""It's important Donald Trump is voted out of office by the American people,"" she told Baldwin. Gabbard, who  qualified  for the October Democratic debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times, is the first and only 2020 Democratic presidential candidate to clearly say she does not support moving to impeach Trump. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Kamala Harris of California have all said they support impeachment. And bestselling author and activist Marianne Williamson said in a statement Tuesday that though she has been ""cautious on the topic of impeachment,"" she now believes an impeachment inquiry into Trump is the ""right thing to do."" Pelosi's historic Tuesday announcement marks the most direct step taken by the House Democratic leader to embrace impeachment proceedings and is a significant escalation in the fight between House Democrats and the President."

"During Friday's taping of “The View”, the co-hosts were previewing next week's Democratic debates. When the topic turned to some of the candidates outside of the frontrunners tier, Megan McCain took some digs at the longshots. ""The View""  co-host  Meghan McCain  clashed not only with her co-hosts but with the audience as well during Tuesday's show. The hosts were discussing the latest controversy fueling  Democratic calls  for impeachment, something McCain suggested was an unwise move that she was sick of hearing about. ""Quite frankly, I’m sick of hearing everybody b---h about it. Just do it,"" she said. She noted that in doing so, Democrats would be flouting political concerns from  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , and ignoring the history surrounding former President Bill Clinton's impeachment. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CLAIMS UKRAINE AID WAS STALLED OVER CORRUPTION CONCERNS, DECRIES MEDIA 'FRENZY' After noting that co-host Sunny Hostin had long supported impeachment, Hostin cheered the word. When the audience applauded in response, McCain told them to let her finish her comments. ""Let me finish, thank you,"" she said. Co-host Joy Behar argued that Democrats would ""get it together"" before the election — ""Don't worry about the Democrats,"" she said. McCain appeared to mock that by saying she wanted the show to display a clip of Behar's comments on election night. Someone in the audience apparently booed, prompting McCain to respond: ""Oh, come on."" Their comments came as Pelosi faced heightened pressure to impeach the president following a report that he told the Ukrainian president to look into corruption allegations surrounding the Biden family. Co-host Abby Huntsman, who previously cautioned against jumping to conclusions on the issue, said on Tuesday that the issue concerned her a lot. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""In my opinion, this is extortion,"" she said, referring to speculation that Trump tacitly withheld aid to pressure Ukraine into investigating  former Vice President Joe Biden.  Trump has denied any quid pro quo and claimed that he resisted giving aid to Ukraine because he wanted other countries to contribute."
"Trump, who was in the middle of a broad review of foreign aid programs when he singled out Ukraine specifically this summer, was primarily concerned with ""corruption"" in Ukraine and Europe shouldering more of the financial burden for supporting Ukraine's defense, according to one of the officials. News of Trump's order to withhold aid to the Ukraine ahead of his July 25 call may trigger questions -- and speculation -- about the President's motive in doing so.  Trump had ordered a hold on nearly $400 million of military and security aid to Ukraine at least a week before the call in question, US officials familiar with the matter tell CNN.  The Washington Post  first reported the figure. The administration was looking at harnessing multiple foreign packages, several aides believed, when Trump took a special interest in Ukraine, at times railing about how the country wasted money in his eyes. This surprised several staffers because, as CNN has reported, Trump had not been interested in engaging with Ukraine in the past, believing Ukraine was a corrupt country that wasn't committed to reform.  But his attentiveness to the country had ramped up in recent weeks as his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani pushed muddled corruption accusations against Biden, who was leading in national polls against Trump, and his son Hunter.  There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. On Friday, CNN  reported  Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. On the day of Trump's call with Zelensky, word began to spread that Trump was reviewing a plan to cut foreign assistance to Ukraine. That call was part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. Trump on Sunday  said  that he did indeed discuss Biden with Ukraine's president -- at a time when the country was awaiting the aid package from the United States -- but he denied doing anything improper. Neither Trump nor his aides have given another reason why his administration singularly stalled the Ukrainian aid package for several weeks.  Citing three senior administration officials with knowledge of the internal deliberations, the Post said officials at the Office of Management and Budget passed along Trump's request to the Pentagon and the State Department at an interagency meeting in mid-July.  According to the paper, administration officials were told to tell lawmakers that the delay in aid was the result of an ""interagency process"" without giving more information.  The growing controversy has brought House Democrats near a ""tipping point"" on impeachment as the party weighs how to respond to the incident. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who sharpened her rhetoric over the weekend, is still not committing to moving forward with impeachment proceedings -- though she is keeping the door open. This story has been updated with CNN reporting from two senior administration officials."
"Judge Napolitano's Chambers: Judge Andrew Napolitano explains how President Trump asking a foreign government or any foreign national to get dirt on a political rival is an impeachable offense. Last week, media outlets reported the existence of a whistleblower complaint filed with the inspector general of the intelligence community against President Donald Trump. The IC encompasses all civilian and military employees and contractors who work for the federal government gathering domestic and foreign intelligence. The inspector general -- a position appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate -- exists in all parts of the executive branch of the government, except for the White House, to examine and determine if officials are following the law. A whistleblower refers to a person who works for the government and who believes that her or his colleagues and bosses are engaged in unconstitutional or unlawful or dangerous behavior. A federal statute expressly provides procedures for federal employees to follow in order to make known to an inspector general the potentially unlawful or dangerous behavior. INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES REVIEWING UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT IN CLOSED SESSION In the case of the IC, since the subject of a whistleblower complaint can be so serious -- often involving classified materials that affect national security -- the rules provide for an immediate review of the complaint. The complaint against Trump alleged that he offered a ""promise"" to a foreign head of state that was unlawful or threatening to national security. The IC inspector general -- a Trump appointee -- evaluated the complaint, interviewed the whistleblower, examined documents that the whistleblower provided and concluded that the complaint was ""urgent and credible."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Biden The complaint related that Trump held up the sale of $250 million worth of military equipment and the delivery of $140 million in congressionally mandated foreign aid until the government of Ukraine opened a criminal investigation against the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading Democratic contender to oppose Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Can the president of the United States legally ask a foreign government to provide assistance to his reelection? In a word: No. Here is the backstory. After special counsel Robert Mueller delivered his report of the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russian agents to the Department of Justice, and then testified about what he discovered, Trump claimed exoneration. Mueller's report found some evidence of a conspiracy -- 127 telephone calls and numerous meetings -- between Trump's campaign and Russian agents, but not enough to charge the crime of conspiracy to solicit foreign assistance in a domestic political campaign. Mueller also found 10 instances in which Trump had committed the criminal offense of obstruction of justice by his personal efforts to derail the Mueller investigation. Mueller did not seek an indictment of Trump for behavior that would have gotten any other person in America indicted because Mueller knew that his boss, Attorney General William Barr, who needed to sign off on such an indictment, would not do so. Trump felt exonerated and emboldened. At the same time that the country was debating publicly what the Mueller report revealed about his behavior, the president instructed the Treasury Department to hold off on the licenses it had provisionally granted to American arms manufacturers to sell a quarter of a billion dollars in arms to Ukraine. He also instructed the State Department to hold off on the delivery of $140 million in direct aid to Ukraine that Congress told him to deliver. Also at the same time, he began his conversations with his Ukrainian counterpart, during which he urged a criminal investigation of the younger Biden, even though Biden's commercial activities in Ukraine while his father was vice president have produced no credible evidence of criminal behavior. Yet, as if to flaunt the Mueller findings, Trump apparently personally and directly committed the crime for which he claimed Mueller exonerated him. What was that crime? It was the attempt to solicit foreign assistance for his campaign. It was the manipulation of American foreign and military policy for a corrupt purpose. A corrupt purpose puts the president personally above the needs of the nation. In short, the whistleblower alleges that Trump offered a bribe to his Ukrainian counterpart: Go after my likely opponent's son and you will get the $390 million in goods and cash that we are holding up. If demonstrable, this behavior is far worse than anything alleged or uncovered by Mueller. The acts of obstruction that Mueller found arguably constitute impeachable offenses. That's because the constitutional language of ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" as one of the three bases for impeachment has been found by the House of Representatives, in three different generations, to include obstruction. Yet there is still wiggle room as to how much personal presidential obstruction and underlying criminality is needed to constitute an impeachable offense. There is no such wiggle room for bribery. The Constitution is quite clear that ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors"" shall constitute a basis for impeachment. Was Trump offering to bribe the Ukrainian president? The circumstantial evidence is: Yes. The transcript of Trump's critical conversation with the Ukrainian president shows he asked his counterpart to coordinate with American authorities to prosecute the son of his likely political opponent in 2020. That is the solicitation of something of value from a foreign government -- a felony. Within a week of that conversation, Trump put his hold on the $390 million in aid. That's when the Ukrainian president got the message. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Where does this leave us? We are at the precipice of a constitutional crisis. We have a president whose apparent corruption is palpable. We have a Constitution that prescribes a remedy. We have an attorney general who acts as if he were the president's personal lawyer. We have Republicans in Congress who see and hear no evil from this president. And we have congressional Democrats hesitant to do their constitutional duty. We have a mess.

"Rep. Kevin McCarthy defends Trump against whistleblower report.

McCarthy said on "" Special Report with Bret Baier ."" ""Let this president govern this nation. He’s proved he can do it economically,"" McCarthy said before adding ""This world is safer because of President Trump."" The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Former FBI Director  James Comey  has seemingly had a change of heart on impeachment as more details have surfaced surrounding  President Trump's  phone call with  Ukraine's  leader. During an interview Tuesday with  KCRA-TV , Comey suggested that  impeaching Trump would be the wrong decision and that Democrats might stoke conspiracy theories by pursuing it . ""I think the American people would be let off the hook if Donald Trump were impeached and removed from office and a lot of his supporters would think some sort of coup had taken place,"" he said. But on Wednesday, Comey tweeted that impeachment might be necessary for Congress to maintain its oath to uphold the Constitution. COMEY SAYS HE HOPES CONGRESS DOESN'T IMPEACH TRUMP: IT LETS AMERICAN PEOPLE 'OFF THE HOOK' ""Some media are quoting me from last week about my hope that America will remove Donald Trump by an election, not Impeachment,"" he wrote. ""But we may now be at the point where members of the House and Senate can’t uphold their own oaths to support and defend the Constitution without acting."" Comey, a vociferous critic of Trump, has dismissed concerns about a ""deep state"" opposed to the president while challenging the idea that he and others plotted against then-candidate Trump in 2016. ""There was no corruption. There was no treason. There was no attempted coup. Those are lies, and dumb lies at that.

"National security attorney Bradley Moss and attorney Harmeet Dhillon weigh in on the whistleblower complaint. President Trump  said in a tweet that he will release on Wednesday a transcript of his July phone call to Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky , in which they reportedly discussed an investigation involving Joe Biden. ""I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,"" Trump wrote. ""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!"" Trump added: ""The Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it, including legislation on gun safety, lowering of prescription drug prices, infrastructure, etc. So bad for our Country!"" Department of Justice lawyers, as well as lawyers at the White House, have been advising White House officials to release the transcript since last week, a source familiar with the conversations told Fox News. The dramatic ""flip-the-script"" moment could blunt Democrats' newly energized  push to begin a formal impeachment inquiry , based on a whistleblower's allegation that the president pressed the new Ukrainian leader during the phone call to investigate the former vice president and his son Hunter. But Democrats were sure to continue their push for the whistleblower's full complaint and testimony, which could provide additional details. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Tuesday afternoon that testimony from the whistleblower might be imminent. ""We have been informed by the whistleblower’s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI [Director of National Intelligence] as to how to do so,"" Schiff said in a tweet. ""We‘re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week."" It was unclear if Acting DNI Joseph Maguire would provide that guidance. Maguire is expected to testify himself before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday -- but Maguire has refused to share some information, including the complaint. A source familiar with the matter  told Fox News this week  that the whistleblower did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president. And Yahoo News  reported  that the GOP-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee had  written to the whistleblower's attorney, requesting a bipartisan closed-door interview . At the same time, the matter  threatened to shine a harsh spotlight  on the Bidens' activities in Ukraine, and top Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., warned the situation could ""backfire"" on Democrats. ""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who believe Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy. Joe Biden  has acknowledged  that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm  Burisma Holdings  — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

       Top Trump surrogates, including his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, have long said that Ukraine should investigate that matter fully. And Trump has long said he wants European countries to pay more for their own defense. An administration official  told the Wall Street Journal  that Trump's actions on the call with Zelensky in July ""reflected the president’s concerns about how the U.S. is spending aid money and whether U.S. allies are adequately contributing."" In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine  a ""disgrace,""  and added: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?” Still, there were other indications that releasing the transcript would not fully satisfy the  growing chorus  of Democrats calling for an impeachment inquiry. In a statement on Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., strongly suggested that impeachment might be on the table if the whistleblower's full complaint was not provided to Congress. ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi said. She was expected to get behind an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday. Several commentators also cast skepticism on Trump's announcement within minutes. ""Nixon released his own transcripts of the Oval Office tapes — which turned out to be wildly misleading,"" said historian  Kevin Cruse. Added Politico correspondent Natasha Bertrand: ""Full transcript ≠ full whistleblower complaint.""

Biden, who has been the 2020 Democratic frontrunner, attracted scrutiny for pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating a natural gas firm where his son, Hunter, served on the board of directors. Republicans have used the opportunity to turn the tables on Biden, claiming that the Ukraine controversy highlighted how Biden abused his power while in office. Warren also seemed to benefit from  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's  decision to impeach Trump, something Pelosi, D-Calif., announced on Tuesday despite previous calls from Warren and others. Pelosi resisted calls for impeachment surrounding the Russia investigation but seemed to face a tipping point after news surfaced about Trump's call with Zelensky. The speaker decried Trump's conduct while also accusing his administration of breaking the law by trying to suppress a whistleblower report on the president's comments. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Warren, on Saturday, was just one of many to pressure Pelosi after the initial news surfaced and before the speaker announced impeachment proceedings. ""Congress failed to act and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system,” Warren said, apparently knocking Pelosi's previous reluctance on the issue."
"""Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion,"" Biden said Friday. ""Not one single one, and so I have no comment except the President should start to be president."" Biden said no more about the issue as he and his staff loaded into a van to depart the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, after hosting a town hall on Friday afternoon.  His remarks came as a communication between Trump and a foreign leader prompted  a whistleblower complaint that is now at the center of a dispute  between the director of national intelligence and Congress. The whistleblower's complaint deals at least in part with Ukraine, The New York Times and Washington Post reported Thursday night, prompting speculation that it could be tied to reports that the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, had asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.  Trump pressed Ukraine's President to investigate Hunter Biden during a call earlier this summer, a person familiar with the situation said Friday. In 2014, while Biden was vice president under President Barack Obama, Hunter Biden joined the board of a natural gas company called Burisma owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. In 2016, while Burisma was being investigated, Western governments, including the Obama administration, called for the removal of Ukraine's top prosecutor due to concerns about corruption in his office. Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor wasn't let go. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  On Thursday, Giuliani denied asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden but moments later said he had done just that. Giuliani's comments came in a heated exchange on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" as Chris Cuomo pressed the former New York mayor over conversations he'd had with a Ukrainian official about Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of the prosecutor -- who had investigated Burisma. Earlier Friday,  Trump continued to blast news of the whistleblower complaint  in the Oval Office, calling it ""a ridiculous story."" ""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" he said, adding, ""It's just another political hack job.""  Trump said he doesn't know the identity of the person who made the complaint. Later Friday, Biden released a statement about the whistleblower complaint, saying: ""If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump's willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. ... At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress."" UPDATE: This story has been updated with additional context about the lack of evidence to support the allegations against the Bidens. "
"Now the future of those benefits is at the heart of an emerging split among  2020 Democratic candidates  over how to remake American health care. Former Vice President Joe Biden says union members shouldn't have to give up their employer plans if they like them, while Sen. Bernie Sanders is arguing that union workers would still come out ahead under ""Medicare for All,"" which would shift all Americans into a government-run plan. The fight puts Sanders, a declared democratic socialist, at odds with some in the labor movement, where many union workers already have insurance with pretty good benefits. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is also seeking the nomination, is in a similar situation because of her support for both Medicare for All and organized labor. Already, there's a growing divide among unions as to whether to back Sanders' universal coverage proposal. National Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses, are very vocal supporters of Medicare for All. But the International Association of Fire Fighters opposes  eliminating employer-based coverage . Still other unions, such as the Service Employees International Union, say they support all efforts to expand coverage to more people. Roughly 10.5% of workers -- or 14.7 million people -- were union members in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about half the share that were unionized 35 years earlier. Some 95% of union workers had access to employer medical benefits in 2019, compared to 68% of non-union workers, according to the bureau's data. And they were more likely to participate in the plans, with 84% of union staffers signing up, compared to 54% of their non-union counterparts.  ""Bargaining for health benefits is a distinguishing characteristic that labor unions hold out as an important variable as to why you would want to be a union member,"" said David Brenner, national director of multi-employer consulting at Segal Consulting, a leader in the field.  The quality of their health plans varies widely, experts said. Unions that cover a lot of lower-wage employees, such as custodians or nurse's aides, may have more basic benefits and have to pay more for them. But other unions, including those in the construction,  auto industry and some hotel trades, have more generous policies -- with low premiums, deductibles and co-pays. A few have even set up their own health clinics for members to get care. Many health packages are so comprehensive that unions feared getting hit with the Affordable Care Act's Cadillac tax, which would have slapped a levy on the value of employer-provided coverage above a certain threshold. Companies and unions quickly banded together to fight it, fearing they'd have to curtail workers' health benefits. The implementation date has been delayed twice, and the House recently voted to  repeal the provision . The United Auto Workers, who are currently striking against General Motors, are among the unions with high-quality plans. Members pay only about 3% of the total cost of their health care, while salaried staffers have to cover about one-third, according to GM. Until recently, the automaker had been seeking to shift more of the bill to the UAW workforce. But GM has dropped its request for major changes in the health care plan. Talks are now hung up on other issues, including pay, the use of temporary workers and a union demand to shift work from Mexico to facilities slated to close in the US. However, GM has also  stopped paying for health insurance  for the striking workers, who will have to sign up for COBRA. The UAW's strike fund is picking up the cost. Sanders took the opportunity earlier this week to note that  union members wouldn't have to fear  losing their benefits during strikes under Medicare for All. Medical benefits is a central component of most contract negotiations. Health care is a major expense for most companies, and they have been pushing more of the cost onto non-union employees for years. They want organized labor to contribute more too. But union workers are willing to make sacrifices to shield their health care coverage, including curtailing raises or other benefits. ""In an awful lot of cases, workers are forgoing any increase in wages in order to keep their deductibles from going even higher,"" said Tom Leibfried, legislative representative for the AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 national and international labor unions that represent 12.5 million people. There's also a growing trend of contract talks breaking down in part over health benefits, said Alex Colvin, dean of Cornell University's ILR School, formerly known as the School of Industrial and Labor Relations. Health coverage was among the issues in United Steelworkers' strike against National Grid in Massachusetts and the teachers' strike in West Virginia last year. ""There's a lot more labor unrest and the cost of health care is one of the drivers of that,"" Brenner said. Health care is important to union workers for several reasons, said Shaun Richman, program director at the SUNY Empire State College's School of Labor Studies who also was a deputy director of organizing for the American Federation of Teachers. ""You can take a higher raise to the bank, but when your kid gets sick, the peace of mind of good health insurance is important,"" Richman said. Also, ""it's a badge of honor of maintaining the health insurance and not taking concessions on it.""  Recognizing that he needs unions' support, Sanders issued a  Workplace Democracy plan  last month that would require companies to pass along savings resulting from Medicare for All to workers in the form of raises or other benefits. Unions would be allowed to maintain their clinics and provide supplemental coverage, as long as it doesn't duplicate the benefits available under Medicare for All. A Warren aide told CNN recently that the campaign is talking with labor leaders about how unions with negotiated health care plans will be guaranteed a chance to rework their agreements during a Medicare for All transition. That may not be enough for some unions, though. ""There has to be a role for the hard-fought, high-quality plans that we've negotiated,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told Fox News earlier this month. ""If there isn't some way for us to have our plans integrated into the system, then we would have a hard time supporting it."""
"Democrats for now don't plan to make the findings of  special counsel Robert Mueller's report  into potential obstruction of justice central to their impeachment push, which has been under review by the House Judiciary Committee, though Pelosi has told Democrats that the probe into those and other matters will continue. The focus, however, will be squarely on the whistleblower allegations of wrongdoing by the President, as Democrats push to rapidly move forward on formal articles of impeachment as soon as this fall.  The decision to make the House Intelligence Committee initially take the lead provides more clarity over how Pelosi characterized the strategy earlier this week when she said the probe would be done by six committees under the ""umbrella"" of an impeachment inquiry. The initial description led to some confusion among members about how the investigation would take shape. But Democratic leadership aides say that the other committees will continue their investigations -- and the focus could shift back to other elements of Trump's potential wrongdoing once the Ukraine probe plays out.  Yet broadening out the probe could also lose the support of some moderate Democrats who want the focus to stay trained on the Ukraine matter. They argue that raising concerns about Trump potentially weakening the country's security is a clearer message for voters back home.  In a news conference Thursday, Pelosi said that  the whistleblower complaint  is within the purview of the House Intelligence Committee and the timeline for the House's impeachment inquiry will be determined by that panel's investigation. ""The focus now is on this allegation,"" Pelosi said. ""This is a coverup."" Pelosi added, ""When the committee finishes its work, and we have the work that has already been done by other chairs, there will be some determinations about how we proceed. But, I'm not going to go into that today.""  Democrats have zeroed  in on a July 25 phone call , in which Trump pushed for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter. Trump has said that the call was appropriate. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. A whistleblower's complaint released Thursday states that several White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by the Trump-Zelensky phone call and tried to ""lock down"" all records of it, especially the word-for-word transcript produced by the White House.  Democrats have spent months on the President's potential obstruction of justice from Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. But the allegations raised in the past week have motivated Pelosi to support an impeachment inquiry, removing  the strongest impediment  to Democrats in the House writing articles of impeachment. The process is now expected to play out like this: The House Intelligence Committee will continue with its probe but the House Judiciary Committee will vote on the articles of impeachment before the full House takes up the matter. Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, told reporters on Thursday that his panel is ""going to move as expeditiously as possible."" The whistleblower complaint, he said, would provide a ""roadmap"" for the committee's push to interview witnesses and seek document requests over the matter. Rep. Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, told CNN he would hope the panel hear from ""anybody"" who was involved in moving the record of the phone call to a different electronic system used to store classified information. House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, declined to comment when asked whether his panel would write articles of impeachment charging the President with abuse of power. But some Democrats on the Judiciary Committee told CNN they expected they would be based at least in part on a reconstruction of the call released by the White House and the whistleblower's complaint. ""I believe the Ukraine issue will be part of an article of impeachment that shows abuse of power, abuse of office, the unpatriotic behavior of this President putting his own political gain above his oath — above our country,"" said Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania. ""This will definitely be an important article of impeachment."" ""I think abuse of power is going to be a central part of the articles of impeachment,"" added Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch of Florida. ""And that's on full display in the Intelligence Committee hearing this morning."" The intelligence community inspector general deemed the whistleblower's complaint to be ""credible and urgent,"" a conclusion that set in motion acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire's  appearance before Congress on Thursday. Republicans pointed out that the whistleblower acknowledges in the complaint that he or she was not a ""was not a direct witness to most of the events described.""  ""I think today was a circus that shouldn't have taken place,"" said Rep. John Ratcliffe, a Texas Republican. ""I think the transcript speaks for itself. It's the best evidence of what happened, not a third-hand account from a whistleblower who wasn't there.""  ""Nowhere in there did I see the words 'have to,' 'must,' 'will,' — anything that exerted the kind of undue influence that the Democrats promised was going to be in there,"" Ratcliffe added. Democrats noted that the whistleblower cited ""more than half a dozen US officials"" in the complaint and was deemed ""credible"" by the intelligence community inspector general. ""At the end of the day, what is alleged in this whistleblower complaint goes to the very heart of the President's oath of office,"" Schiff said. On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that the House would launch an ""official impeachment inquiry."" Pelosi mentioned that six committees — Intelligence, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Oversight, Financial Services and Ways and Means — would investigate under the ""umbrella"" of that inquiry. But there has been some confusion among House Democrats about how the inquiry will move forward. When asked about Pelosi's announcement Tuesday setting up the ""umbrella"" of an impeachment inquiry, one Democratic congressman granted anonymity told CNN, ""I don't know what that means exactly."" That lack of clarity could lead to some infighting among the committees. Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who serves on the Oversight panel, said that his committee has jurisdiction over ""all"" federal inspectors general. ""That's an angle we can assert in terms of jurisdiction,"" said Connolly. But when asked if it would, Connolly said, ""We've got to work out who does what."" In a private meeting with House Democrats on Thursday, Pelosi made clear that the Intelligence Committee would be the point panel on the Ukraine investigation, given its jurisdiction and the narrow focus of its probe. Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut asked Pelosi if the five other committees should pause their work, according to a source. Pelosi said that the other panels should continue, but made it clear the Intelligence Committee was in charge — a move that could quicken the pace of the impeachment inquiry. Some Democrats hope for a vote as soon as October. ""I think we are being thorough, but I think we are moving as expeditiously as possible as well,"" said Democratic Rep. Val Demings of Florida. ""We are not wasting any time in terms of following the facts where they lead us."" On their July call, Trump pressed the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden's son Hunter, who sat on the board of an energy company, Burisma Holdings, whose owner was investigated by Ukrainian general prosecutor Viktor Shokin.  ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,"" said Trump on the call, according to a reconstructed transcript released by the White House. ""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me."" Trump also said he wanted his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani,  and Attorney General Bill Barr  to call Zelensky.  ""We will get to the bottom of it,"" Trump said. ""I'm sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything. Your economy is going to get better and better I predict."" While Biden -- when he was vice president -- and other Western leaders  pushed for the dismissal of Shokin  over lackluster anti-corruption efforts in 2016, Trump and Giuliani have claimed without evidence that Biden demanded Shokin's firing on behalf of his son. They cite Biden's threat to withhold $1 billion in aid to Ukraine if the country's leaders did not dismiss the prosecutor. On August 12, a whistleblower expressed concerns to the intelligence community's inspector general Michael Atkinson about Trump's call with Zelensky. Atkinson deemed them credible and urgent and sent the complaint to Maguire. Trump has denied that his call with Zelensky was improper. On Thursday, Trump called Schiff ""Liddle'"" and attacked other Democrats for starting ""another witch hunt"" in a tweet. ""A whistleblower with second hand information,"" asked Trump on Twitter. ""Another Fake News Story! See what was said on the very nice, no pressure, call. Another Witch Hunt!"""
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying House Speaker Pelosi's efforts to 'restrain her far-left conference have finally crumbled'; reaction from Hank Sheinkopf, former Democratic consultant for Bill Clinton's campaign, and Kevin McCullough, radio host with Salem Media. Select members of the  congressional intelligence committees on Wednesday afternoon received the whistleblower complaint  and related documents that has sparked an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, reviewing the materials in closed session. The chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Richard Burr, R-N.C., told Fox News he and several other members of the congressional intelligence panels were still in the process of reading the complaint, which raised red flags about a July 25 phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian leader. The complaint alleged that Trump tried to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe potential 2020 rival Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter for possible corruption in exchange for U.S. aid. HOUSE DEMOCRAT WHO ENDORSED BIDEN SAYS IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO 'CLEAR UP' QUESTIONS ON SON'S UKRAINE DEALINGS House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.,  thanked the whistleblower for coming forward after reviewing the complaint and said that he would ""do everything possible to protect you."" ""I think that what this courageous individual has done has exposed serious wrongdoing,"" Schiff told Fox News as he left the SCIF -- sensitive compartmentalized information facility -- on Wednesday.""I think the travesty is that this complaint was withheld as long as it was because it was an urgent matter. It is an urgent matter. And there was simply no basis to keep this from the committee."" Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif.  told Fox News that the complaint ""doesn't change anything about the urgency and the credibility of the issue, and we will press the DNI [director of national intelligence] tomorrow to, you know, produce the full report."" Neither Schiff nor Swalwell would confirm the specifics of the complaint and related documents that they reviewed. On a related note, the House also voted on a resolution Wednesday to have the complaint by an unnamed member of the intelligence community be released to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees before hearings on Thursday with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire are scheduled to take place. Senate Intel Vice Chair Mark Warner said he's ""still processing"" the complaint he read but added, ""it's going to make the testimony received tomorrow all that more important to get some questions cleared up."" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he's ""even more worried about what happened than I was when I read the memorandum of the conversation. There are so many fact to be examined.""

"McAleenan called white supremacist extremism is one of the most ""potent ideologies"" driving acts violence in the US.  ""In our modern age, the continued menace of racially based violent extremism, particularly white supremacist extremism, is an abhorrent affront to the nation, the struggle and unity of its diverse population,"" he said in a speech at the Brookings Institution. He pointed to the attacks in  Poway ,  El Paso ,  Pittsburgh  and  Charleston , saying they were motivated by various extremist ideologies, including ""very concerningly and increasingly, white supremacist violent extremism."" According to McAleenan, ISIS and al Qaeda remain the ""two most pressing radical Islamist terrorist threats"" to the US with potential to direct plots and also to inspire homegrown violent extremism in their name.  The strategic announcement  comes just days after a judge ruled  that the American Airlines mechanic accused of trying to sabotage a commercial airliner before takeoff will be held in custody until trial. The judge said during a bond hearing that Ahmed Alani, who allegedly tried to damage or disable an aircraft's air data module system, ""may be very sympathetic to terrorists.""  Alani has been charged with ""willfully damaging, destroying, disabling, or wrecking an aircraft, and attempting to do so,"" according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court earlier this month. No terror-related charges have been filed. President Donald Trump has been criticized for not condemning white supremacy strongly enough, with some accusing him of exacerbating the problem.  Earlier this month, former Vice President Joe Biden connected Trump's rhetoric with the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, saying in a speech that the President has ""fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation."" In August,  CNN reported that White House officials rebuffed efforts  by their colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a year to make combating domestic terror threats, such as those from white supremacists, a greater priority as specifically spelled out in the National Counterterrorism Strategy, sources told CNN. Last October, the  White House unveiled its national counterterrorism strategy , which offered a broad strokes blueprint for how the Trump administration will and already has approached the threat of terrorism, from targeting terrorists at their source to beefing up efforts domestically to tackle the threat of homegrown terrorism.  Recently-ousted national security adviser John Bolton described the new strategy at the time as a sharp departure from President Barack Obama's approach to confronting terrorism, emphasizing the Trump administration's recognition of the threat as one rooted in radical Islamist ideology. ""Radical Islamist terrorist groups still represent the preeminent threat to the United States,"" Bolton said. ""We recognize that there is a terrorist ideology that we're confronting. And I think it's long been the President's view that without recognizing that we're in an ideological struggle, that we can't properly address the terrorist threat."""
"Sen. John Kennedy dismisses Dem impeachment push, says they just have 'hurt feelings' Many of the Democrats supporting  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's  impeachment inquiry cannot accept, three years later, that  President Trump  won in 2016, according to  Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. There are likely to be two parallel investigations into the situation that spurred Pelosi to officially announce an impeachment inquiry, Kennedy said Tuesday on "" The Story ."" He said that, while Democrats commence a formal impeachment inquiry relating to the context of a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that reportedly mentioned the Biden family's dealings in the country, another probe surrounding  allegations of unsubstantiated wrongdoing  by former Vice President Joe Biden and son Hunter Biden will likely be started by one group or another. ""I think some of my Democratic friends are acting in good faith -- I don't have enough facts to agree with them,"" he said regarding the fresh impeachment inquiry. PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP ""My Democratic friends just can't accept the fact that the American people chose Donald Trump to be president -- it's called democracy. My advice to them, and I say this gently: Fill out a 'Hurt Feelings Report' and let's move on. We've got a lot of issues that are at least as important as who-said-what-to-whom."" Of the potential for twin investigations, Kennedy said the second will be commenced, ""if not by the Republicans, by Vice President Biden's fellow candidates -- of Mister Hunter Biden."" ""I think there are going to be two investigations here."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He also warned against Democrats getting excited about the prospect of formal impeachment proceedings, pointing to remarks made to host Martha MacCallum by House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. earlier in the hour. ""Wait to see what the transcript shows,"" the Louisiana Republican said of the Trump-Zelensky conversation."
"Webster's dictionary  defines  it, in part, as: ""the externalization of blame, guilt, or responsibility as a defense against anxiety.""  Here's one recent, relevant example: ""The one who's got the problem is Biden, because if you look at what Biden did, Biden did what they would like to have me do except there's one problem: I didn't do it."" That, of course, was President Donald Trump, trying to deflect accusations about the covered-up whistleblower's complaint. It reportedly raised concerns about his call with the Ukrainian President, during which, Trump has essentially admitted, he asked for dirt on a political rival's family. Projection is a regular part of the Trump playbook. He's taken the impulse and elevated it to an effective political tactic. For example, during the 2016 campaign, his favorite attack on his final GOP rival for the nomination was to call him ""Lyin' Ted."" Of course, this comes from a person who lied throughout the campaign and has lied more than 12,000 times as president, according to The Washington Post. Cruz was pretty quick to  diagnose  the problem: ""This man is a pathological liar. He doesn't know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth. And he had a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook. His response is to accuse everybody else of lying.""  This impulse to deflect and project continued in the general election against Hillary Clinton. So, when Trump was accused of being the "" most corrupt candidate ever ,"" she became ""Crooked Hillary."" When Trump came under fire for racist appeals, he  called  Clinton a ""bigot.""  When Clinton raised questions about Trump's erratic and impulsive behavior, he  called her unstable , unhinged, lacking the ""judgment, temperament and moral character to lead this country."" And who can forget his, ""No puppet ... You're the puppet,"" response when she accused him in a debate of being a puppet for Vladimir Putin.  To be sure, that one was more of an impulsive bleat than evidence of strategy, but of course the pattern of projection has continued in the White House:   For example, during the Mueller investigation, when he kept  asserting  without evidence that ""there was no Collusion except bye Crooked Hillary and the Democrats."" And in  saying that Russia really wanted Clinton to win  -- despite Putin saying the exact opposite. These projections may be absurd, but they serve a serious political purpose. They muddy the water between fact and fiction and make people think that everyone is guilty of what Trump's been credibly accused of. This increases apathy and cynicism in our democracy by aiming to obliterate citizens' ability to recognize reality.  Because tone comes from the top, you see the President's surrogates and even Cabinet officials echo it. But sometimes they go too far and give away the game. Case in point,  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  on ""Face The Nation"":  ""If there was election interference that took place by the Vice President, I think the American people deserve to know.""  I'm sorry, what's that now? Because literally no one is suggesting that Joe Biden was involved in election interference. But, of course, that's exactly what President Trump is being accused of, and if you can't defend the President's alleged actions, you just deflect and project. Here's the thing: Projection is actually a sign of deep insecurity. Which makes you wonder about the President's favorite insults, which he deploys over and over again on Twitter. An analysis by The Washington Post's Philip Bump found that  his top five insults  were ""fake,"" ""failed,"" ""dishonest,"" ""weak"" and ""liar."" It's enough to make you think President Trump doesn't actually think of himself as a ""very stable genius"" after all."
"The Wall Street Journal reports that in a July phone call, President Trump repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son. President Trump  faced fresh calls for impeachment on Friday after a new report claimed Trump asked the president of Ukraine numerous times in a single phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. Biden said on Friday that the claim has no credibility. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary  Julian Castro , a  2020 candidate , responded to the report by calling Trump a ""criminal"" who need to be impeached ""immediately.""

As I've said before, it's time for impeachment proceedings,"" he tweeted. Fellow 2020 contender  Beto O'Rouke  had already called for impeachment in reaction to statements made by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's attorney, on Thursday night.

""Everything Nixon did during Watergate pales in comparison to Trump using the power of the Presidency to pressure a foreign leader who needs U.S. Aid to investigate a political opponent,"" Pfeiffer said. The whistleblower controversy seemed to raise even more concerns among the 2020 field, many of whom already called for the president's impeachment. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , called on Friday for the whistleblower to come forward, offering protection as he defied the administration. She also suggested that Trump was trying to interfere in the 2020 election like, according to her, he did in 2016. ""He has openly invited interference and now we have information that suggests that again, he is engaged in that kind of behavior,"" she said at a campaign stop. ""What he fails to understand is that he is the President of the United States and that office ... is the people's office -- not his office,"" she added. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., didn't directly address the report on Twitter but did dispute Trump's attorneys' claims that he couldn't be criminally prosecuted.

The  former secretary of state  tweeted that her words were ""not a political statement — it’s a harsh reality, and we must act."" READ THE TRANSCRIPT OF TRUMP'S CONTROVERSIAL UKRAINE CALL ""He is a clear and present danger to the things that keep us strong and free,"" she wrote. ""I  support impeachment "" House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., on Tuesday  announced a formal impeachment inquiry  into Trump in the wake of the controversial call Trump had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on the morning of July 25. THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: HOW DOES REMOVING A PRESIDENT WORK? The rough  transcript of the call  based on notes, released Wednesday morning, shows Trump pushing for Ukraine to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and  U.S. Attorney General   William Barr  to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.” That refers to Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where his son Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump, in the run-up to the transcript's release, was accused by  Democrats  of essentially pressuring a foreign power to investigate a political opponent, given that Biden is now a top contender for the  2020 Democratic presidential nomination . On Monday, it was reported that Trump had even ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before the phone call with Zelensky — a detail that fueled calls for impeachment proceedings. But the transcript does not include any mention of the aid, as a bargaining chip or otherwise. Fox News' Alex Pappas contributed to this report."
"The comments,  first reported  by The New York Times, were made to an audience of career foreign service officers who work at the United Nations, two sources who were in the room and one person who knew someone in the room said. One source said the remarks were ""shocking"" and ""eerie."" Other top US government officials were in the room as well, including the new US Ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft.  Not everyone in the room opposed Trump's comments. US Mission to the United Nations employees could invite their friends or family to the event and most of the people who accepted such an invite were Trump supporters who were not startled by Trump's threatening tone, another source said.   Earlier Thursday, a stunning whistleblower complaint alleged Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and the White House took steps to cover it up. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire also  testified before the House Intelligence Committee  about the whistleblower complaint. The identity of the whistleblower remains publicly unknown, but his or her safety was raised at Maguire's testimony. ""And of course, you will do anything you can to protect the whistleblower from any attempts to retaliate against him or her, correct?"" Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois asked. ""I will not permit the whistleblower to be subject to any retaliation or adverse consequences for going to the IG. I am absolutely committed to that,"" Maguire replied. Former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who is now a CNN contributor, told CNN's Brianna Keilar following the Times' report that Trump's implicit threat is ""exactly what government officials are not supposed to do."" ""He's clearly targeting the person who's filed this complaint that affects him seriously and is kind of laying the marker down that he wants this person's identity and he wants to be able to follow-up on this. So absolutely a total contravention of all the protections for whistleblowers,"" said McCabe, who added that Trump's comments in front of US government employees suggests a message to others who might come forward with damaging information in the future. ""So you have to ask, was this some sort of a message to all of those folks and indeed a message to all people serving in the government that if they step forward with complaints, they can expect the President to come after them?"" Whistleblower's bombshell allegation Several White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and tried to ""lock down"" all records of the phone call, especially the  word-for-word transcript  produced by the White House, the complaint states. The complaint has been at the center of a controversy that has spurred Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. The White House on Wednesday also released a rough transcript of the call that shows Trump repeatedly pressed Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Caving to Democratic demands, the Trump administration let Congress release a declassified version of the complaint, one day after releasing a rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call. The developments triggered a  flood of Democratic lawmakers  to publicly support  impeachment . Trump has maintained that he  didn't do anything wrong , while simultaneously promoting unfounded conspiracy theories about the Bidens, Ukraine, and Russian meddling in 2016. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. CORRECTION: This story's headline has been updated to correctly identify to whom President Donald Trump was referring."

"It's come up this week in connection to  President Donald Trump's  July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to a White House transcript of the call, Trump asked for a ""favor"" -- help from Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 contender.  ""The quid pro quo is in the President's words,"" Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California argued on CNN's ""New Day"" Friday, telling John Berman that Trump's phone call with Zelensky ""makes it very clear."" CNN has confirmed  that Trump ordered a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before the call with Zelensky, which was  first reported  by The Washington Post. Trump  claimed  he withheld the aid because he was waiting for European nations to contribute their fair share and that the delay wasn't related to the investigation request. ""That together with withholding the funds, which preceded the phone call. All of these things are there. And that's not circumstantial,"" Garamendi said. CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin argued on CNN Wednesday that there's ""very strong evidence that there was a quid pro quo here"" in Trump's phone call. Toobin pointed to the section of the White House transcript in which Zelensky mentioned that Ukraine was ready to buy more Javelin missiles from the US. Trump replied, ""I would like you to do us a favor."" ""He raises that at the precise moment after Zelensky raises the issue of we need money for our defense,"" Toobin said. ""Money, favor. Quid pro quo."" Trump on early Wednesday, after the rough transcript was released, denied any wrongdoing, saying there was  ""no pressure whatsoever""  in his phone call with Zelensky. At a separate afternoon news conference in New York, the President added: ""I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo."" The rough transcript, a senior White House official said, was developed with assistance from voice recognition software along with note takers and experts listening. Lawmakers spar over issue of quid pro quo A majority of Republicans fell in line with the White House's argument that the call summary did not provide proof of an explicit quid pro quo. ""There is no quid pro quo, no this for that. Nowhere does the President say that he will withhold military aid unless the Ukraine investigation continues. It's simply not there,"" Republican Rep. Ross Spano of Florida, a former lawyer, argued on the House floor Wednesday.  But Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-New York, also a former lawyer who spoke after Spano, said, ""You don't need to state an explicit quid pro quo when you have conducted the quid pro quo, when you have withheld the military aid."" House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said at a news conference Wednesday that the President's call amounted to a ""classic Mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader."" ""The President of Ukraine brought up his country's need for military assistance and immediately thereafter the President of the United States said, I have a favor I want to ask of you,' and would not let the subject go. There was only one message that that president of Ukraine got from that call,"" Schiff said.  Did Trump violate law? Federal election campaign law makes it a crime for a foreign national -- directly or indirectly -- ""to make a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value"" and for ""a person to solicit, accept, or receive a contribution or donation...from a foreign national."" The phone call between Trump and Zelensky was part of a  whistleblower complaint  to the intelligence community inspector general, and eventually was alerted to the Justice Department.  The Justice Department determined last week that there was no reason for a full-blown finance criminal investigation. What the President asked of Zelensky doesn't amount to a quantifiable ""thing of value"" under campaign finance law,  top administration officials determined . The  whistleblower complaint publicly released  Thursday alleges that Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and the White House took steps to cover it up. White House lawyers were in discussion about ""how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials' retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain,"" the complaint says. ""Looking at the document as a whole, that certainly could be implied,"" George Washington law professor John Banzhaf told CNN on Thursday. ""Whether or not it could be implied and the proof is strong enough to meet a criminal standard ... the answer is probably no. But if in a civil context where the standard is much lower ... I think the answer would be clearly yes."" Banzhaf told CNN on Thursday that it doesn't make any difference whether there is a quid pro quo or not. ""It still arguably would violate the federal election law, and therefore would be a crime,"" Banzhaf said. He added: ""When Trump asked for this information, that by itself probably violates the statute, even if there's no quid pro quo."" Banzhaf also noted that ""thing of value"" has been interpreted ""very, very broadly.""  ""It is not just money, or a flight on an airplane, or even a data set. It's anything which may be of a value to somebody else and might persuade them to do something,"" Banzhaf said, adding later, ""Pretty certainly, information which would be damaging to a possible political opponent, which would be Biden, would meet the criteria of a 'thing of value.'"" On Wednesday, Toobin had also argued that quid pro quo isn't necessary for the call to be ""wildly inappropriate and potentially impeachable.""  ""The very notion of asking a foreign leader for dirt on a political opponent, independent of the issue of quid pro quo, is troubling to many, many people,"" Toobin said on CNN.  This story has been updated with additional developments Friday."
"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff makes remarks after White House releases unredacted text of President Trump's phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Top congressional Democrats made clear Wednesday they will stay the course on impeachment after the release of a rough transcript of President Trump’s controversial  July call  with Ukraine’s president, though the document did not demonstrate an explicit quid pro quo as some reports originally had suggested. “This is a classic Mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said. The memo, which does not reflect a  “verbatim transcript”  but is based on “notes and recollections” of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on his victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, seeking an investigation of some kind. UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER, BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID While the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to ""look into"" the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid -- which had been frozen days earlier, a detail that fueled impeachment calls earlier this week and helped prompt Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday. But Schiff downplayed the absence of any explicit quid pro quo, saying Wednesday it is clear what the president was after. Schiff noted that during the call, Trump lamented that the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine was not always ""reciprocal,"" a comment he made after noting how ""very very good"" the U.S. had been to Ukraine. Zelensky went on to discuss military assistance -- after which, Trump started making certain requests. Trump first asked Zelensky to do a ""favor"" and “find out what happened” with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks. Then, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens. “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.” This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention. On Wednesday, Schiff said all these details “are far more damning than I and others had imagined.” “This is the Ukrainian president who is desperate for military support…[Trump] tells him he has a favor to ask,” he said. Schiff added: “[Trump] communicates that the U.S. has done a lot for Ukraine, but there is not much reciprocity. This is how a mafia boss talks. 'What have you done for us? I have a favor I want to ask you.'” “Of course, the favor is to investigate his political rival. To investigate the Bidens,” Schiff said, adding that another “layer” of misconduct was Trump’s attempt to use Attorney General Bill Barr and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani as “emissaries” who would be “part and parcel in this.” UKRAINE CALL WHISTLEBLOWER SHOWED 'POLITICAL BIAS,' FAVORED TRUMP'S 'RIVAL' CANDIDATE: MEMO “The fact that the president would invoke the attorney general sends a further message to Ukraine—this is not just me asking, this is not just Giuliani asking, but this is the United States government,” Schiff said. The transcript shows Trump saying he wanted the Ukrainian president to speak with both Barr and Giuliani. “There is no quid pro quo necessary to betray your country or your oath of office,” Schiff continued. “Ukraine understood what this president wanted. He had his emissaries making it clear, and Ukraine knew what it needed to do if it wanted to get military assistance.” Schiff and other top committee chairs later released a statement saying: ""Let’s be clear: no quid pro quo is required to betray our country. Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections—that is betrayal enough."" The chairmen added that they will subpoena the White House and State Department for a related whistleblower complaint and other information, should they miss a Thursday deadline to turn it over. This stance suggests Democrats will charge ahead on their impeachment inquiry, ""quid pro quo"" or not. Schiff is likely to be a key figure in the process, as Pelosi's Tuesday decision takes all Trump-focused investigations from six prominent House committees and puts them all “under one umbrella,” according to a Democratic source. Pelosi, on Wednesday, also stood by the need for impeachment. “The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry,” she said in a statement. “Clearly, the Congress must act.” Biden himself also said in a statement that the document “makes clear that days after the President ordered the delay of Congressionally-appropriated military assistance to Ukraine, he implored the President of Ukraine to work with his personal attorney to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent.” But the White House and Trump allies adamantly denied wrongdoing and described the transcript as exculpatory. White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News on Wednesday that “there’s no quid pro quo and there’s no pressure.” House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., also said there was no quid pro quo, and said the Democrats “leapt to conclusions before looking at the facts.” “The real danger here is that Democrats keep using baseless accusations in hopes of crippling a successful presidency,” Collins said in a statement Wednesday. While the transcript does show Trump asking Zelensky to probe Biden, it does not show Trump explicitly linking U.S. aid to Ukraine. Administration officials told Fox News on Tuesday that, at the time, U.S. aid to Ukraine was frozen, but claimed that it was over corruption concerns and other countries not paying their fair share. Meanwhile, Democrats are moving on other fronts as well. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has called for Barr to step aside from any review of the matter. “The President dragged the Attorney General into this mess,” Nadler tweeted. “At a minimum, AG Barr must recuse himself until we get to the bottom of this matter.” The Justice Department, though, has denied involvement in any potential investigations into Biden or anything else. “The president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. “The president has not asked the attorney general to contact Ukraine—on this or any other matter. The attorney general has not communicated with Ukraine—on this or any other subject. Nor has the attorney general discussed this matter, or anything related to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.” Meanwhile, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., questioned why Giuliani was involved in the first place. “What role does Rudolph Giuliani have in this government?” he asked during a House Democratic press conference Wednesday. “Is he in the Department of Justice? Is he the secretary of state? Is he an ambassador to Ukraine or to the European Union?” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  “Rudolph Giuliani is the president’s political hit man,” he continued. “And in an official conversation with the president of Ukraine, he directed the Ukrainian president to have a follow up conversation with Giuliani as part of the effort to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.” The Washington Post on Wednesday reported that Giuliani has been involved in pursuing a ""shadow agenda"" with Ukraine—an allegation the former New York City mayor has denied, calling it “complete nonsense.”  He tweeted Wednesday: ""The transcript really shows how dishonest news media is. Unlike Joe Biden, no military aid was withheld, no threats, and absolutely no pressure. Zelensky introduces me into the conversation, not POTUS Trump.""

Napolitano responded, ""yes,"" and claimed it was the same crime former  Special Counsel Robert Mueller  investigated as part of the long-running  Russia investigation . Napolitano's comments came amid renewed calls for impeachment and just before  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , announced the formalization of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump on Tuesday.

He has also denied any wrongdoing, and Shokin was widely criticized for allegedly being too soft on corruption. In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said.

Giuliani previously said that he directed Ukraine to investigate Biden but not as part of an effort to help Trump win reelection. The reality is, the distinction is this: What they’re saying is, I went there for, on a political mission, to kind of get Joe Biden in trouble.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Saturday dismissed news reports that he  urged the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son  as little more than a “witch hunt” and said his dealings were “perfectly fine” and routine. “Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He said that any effort to investigate him would fail, comparing it to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into his ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign. The news reports he was referring to have revealed the existence of a secret whistle-blower complaint that is believed to have been filed, at least partly, in response to Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The New York Times  reported  Friday that Mr. Trump, in a July call, pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Biden’s son, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Mr. Trump, intensifying a line of attack he and his allies have stoked for months, said the real problem was Mr. Biden, who according to most polls is the leading candidate in a crowded Democratic field and has framed himself as the most likely to defeat Mr. Trump in the general election. “The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,” Mr. Trump wrote, “so they fabricate a story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine.” No evidence  has surfaced to bolster Mr. Trump’s claim that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor general’s dismissal. Another tweet from Mr. Trump , which featured his campaign’s phone number, included a series of video clips featuring journalists, including some from The New York Times, discussing Mr. Biden and Ukraine on television news programs. Citing the reports by journalists seemed ironic given the president’s claim that the media had not reported on Mr. Biden. But the tweets signaled that Mr. Trump and his campaign organization would be doing as much as possible to sow doubt about Mr. Biden. Friday’s reports on the president drew strong reactions from top Democrats and, for some, brought a new urgency to calls for Mr. Trump’s impeachment. “There is no bottom. Impeach him,” Beto O’Rourke said on Friday evening. And Joe Walsh, a former congressman from Illinois who has launched a long-shot challenge to Mr. Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, urged others in his party who were alarmed by the president’s behavior to come forward. “He doesn’t believe in the rule of law,” Mr. Walsh wrote on Twitter on Saturday morning. “He abuses his power whenever he wants. He lies at will. He doesn’t know the meaning of checks & balances. And he sees nothing wrong with telling a foreign government to dig up dirt on his opponents. Come on Republicans. Be better than this.” Although Mr. Mueller wrote in his report that he found “insufficient evidence” to accuse the president or his advisers of a criminal conspiracy with the Russians, his investigators said his campaign welcomed Moscow’s intereference and expected to benefit from it. Democrats are using Mr. Mueller’s findings as part of the basis for their impeachment inquiry. Mr. Biden, for his part, has dismissed the president’s attacks. “If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country,” he said in a statement released after The Times and other new organizations, including The Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, reported Mr. Trump’s conversations with Mr. Zelensky. “This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes.” For years,  the Bidens have faced questions  about the association of Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, with one of Ukraine’s largest natural gas companies, and whether or not there was any connection to Mr. Biden’s efforts as vice president to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor whose office had authority over investigations of the oligarch whose company paid his son. Mr. Biden’s son earned as much as $50,000 per month in some months for his work for the company, Burisma Holdings. This year, the current Ukrainian prosecutor general reopened an investigation into Burisma just as Mr. Biden began  his 2020 presidential campaign ."
"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff makes remarks after White House releases unredacted text of President Trump's phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Top House Democrats  demanded the administration turn over a whistleblower's report on  President Trump's  dealings with  Ukraine , indicating that a recently released transcript was ""damning"" for the president but insufficient for continuing their investigation. ""Congress needs the full and unredacted whistleblower complaint,"" a statement from multiple committee chairmen read on Wednesday. ""We need to speak with the whistleblower. We need records of the communications. Thursday is the deadline for the information to be turned over. ""We need to speak with those knowledgeable about efforts by the president, the attorney general and the president’s personal attorney to secure political help from Ukraine, the decision to freeze security assistance, and the attempt to cover it up. “We also need the records that our committees requested from the State Department and the White House -- by tomorrow’s deadline -- or we will subpoena them."" DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE, DESCRIBE CALL AS MAFIA-STYLE 'SHAKEDOWN' The committee chairs -- Reps. Elijah Cummings, D-Md.,  Adam Schiff, D-Calif. ,  Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.,  and Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. -- helped turn up the pressure on the White House as  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,   started pursuing  official impeachment proceedings. During her Tuesday announcement, Pelosi specifically accused the administration of breaking the law by suppressing a whistleblower from reporting on Trump's comments to Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky . The committees' subpoena threat came just after the White House released a transcript of the president's July call with Zelensky in an apparent attempt to assuage concerns he engaged in some kind of quid pro quo. The transcript contained no explicit quid pro quo for foreign aid but stoked Democrats' concerns as it showed Trump requesting an investigation into  former Vice President Joe Biden  at a sensitive time in U.S.-Ukrainian relations. Democrats suspected that Trump tried to interfere in the  2020 election  by pressuring Zelensky into pursuing allegations that Biden, seen as the frontrunner among Democrats seeking to unseat Trump, improperly influenced the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in order to protect his son Hunter. Shokin had been investigating a natural gas firm that Hunter Biden led as a member of the board of directors. 'SQUAD' MEMBERS CALL FOR IMPEACHMENT AFTER TRUMP RELEASES UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT: 'WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT' ""Let’s be clear: no quid pro quo is required to betray our country. Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections -- that is betrayal enough. The corruption exists whether or not Trump threatened -- explicitly or implicitly -- that a lack of cooperation could result in withholding military aid,"" the statement by chairs of the House Oversight, Judiciary, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs committees read. “Ukraine depends on the U.S. for economic, military, and diplomatic support -- especially in its attempts to push back against Russian aggression -- and is particularly vulnerable to pressure from any U.S. president. For a country so reliant on the United States, nothing more was needed. ""The call reportedly was preceded by a decision by Trump to withhold vital security assistance, and it was followed in quick succession by his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, meeting with a top aide to the new Ukrainian president at Trump’s direction. According to reports, the Ukrainians eventually became aware that the aid was being withheld and expressed concern to U.S. officials."" Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has admitted to telling Ukraine to investigate Biden but maintained it was not a part of any broader attempt to influence the 2020 presidential election. Fox News' Mike Emanuel contributed to this report."
"President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani on his conversation with Ukraine officials. Just hours after Rep.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y., said her party's failure so far to impeach President Trump  amounted to a major ""national scandal,""  House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi  appeared to relent on Sunday -- and warn that a ""whole new stage of investigation"" could be approaching. Pelosi, who has  long resisted calls to impeach Trump  because the move would  imperil the electability of moderate Democrats  in the House, outlined her new stance in a statement Sunday. Pelosi specifically said that a whistleblower who reportedly alleged that  Trump acted improperly  during a July 25 phone call with  Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy must be allowed to speak to Congress, and the full whistleblower complaint must be provided. Her aggressive push came as top Republicans, including California Rep. Devin Nunes, predicted that the gambit  would backfire for Democrats . Later in the evening, Trump sounded a similar note, saying the ""real story"" was that ""Sleepy Joe Biden"" had ""forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by the threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine."" The whistleblower drama escalated after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump repeatedly had asked Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son who had a key role in a natural gas firm that a Ukrainian prosecutor had been investigating as part of a corruption probe. At a conference two years after he left office, Joe Biden  openly bragged  about successfully pressuring Ukraine to  fire that prosecutor  when he was vice president. CNN  later reported the whistleblower had no direct knowledge of the call, and a top  Ukrainian  official on Saturday  defended Trump's  actions. Unverified reports  circulated on left-leaning media outlets  claiming that Trump could have promised something improper in exchange for Ukraine's compliance, although the Journal reported there was no ""quid-pro-quo"" involved. But if Democrats' demands were not met, Pelosi said, the Trump administration's ""grave new chapter of lawlessness"" would necessitate drastic action. ""We must be sure that the President and his Administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President’s personal or political interest,"" Pelosi said. FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED Speaking to CNN's ""State of the Union,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also said impeachment was on the table. Schiff previously has claimed to have  hard evidence  that the Trump team improperly colluded with Russia. “Why doesn’t the president just say, ‘Release the whistleblower complaint.’ Clearly he’s afraid for the public to see,” Schiff said. “This would be the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions.” “We may have crossed the Rubicon here,” he added, referring to the river that Julius Caesar fatefully traversed in 49 BC. “I have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment. ... but that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that that conduct represents.” The top Democrats' rhetoric came soon after Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday night kickstarted a  dormant, but long-simmering and occasionally explosive feud  with top House Democrats in the form of a fiery  tweet:  ""At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it."" Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a closed-door meeting in July, in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. That meeting came shortly before the departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti. Trump  acknowledged Sunday  that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned ""the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."" The president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call. GIULIANI CLARIFIES CONFUSING CNN COMMENTS ON UKRAINE Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, has long said publicly he  wanted Ukraine to look into the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine , and  admitted this week  that he's asked Ukraine to do so in the past -- but denied any impropriety or illegal conduct again on Sunday. ""This violation is about our national security,"" Pelosi said. ""The Inspector General determined that the matter is 'urgent' and therefore we face an emergency that must be addressed immediately."" Inspector General Michael Atkinson of the office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) wrote in a Sep. 9 letter to the House Intelligence Committee that the whistleblower complaint ""appeared credible"" and related to an ""urgent"" matter. But, the DNI general counsel said days later that, after consulting with the DOJ, the matter did not meet the legal definition of an ""urgent concern,"" and was not subject to mandatory disclosure to Congress. Trump's conversation came as the White House was holding up $250 million in military aid for Ukraine, money that the White House later released. The president has said he wanted European countries to pay more for their own defense, and  denied delaying any military aid funding. HOUSE INTEL RANKING REPUBLICAN: THIS IS THE END OF THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN ""Furthermore, because the complaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community, the DNI lacks unilateral authority to transmit such materials to the intelligence committees,"" Jason Klitenic, the DNI general counsel, wrote. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday. In her statement, Pelosi said Democrats would be watching closely. ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi said. ""Thank you for your patriotism."" Even some Republicans cautioned that the situation could be serious. Utah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney, a onetime Trump presidential rival,  tweeted  that ""If the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival,"" that ""would be troubling in the extreme."" At the same time, California  Rep. Devin Nunes  predicted on Fox News'  ""Sunday Morning Futures""  that  Biden's  campaign is likely coming to an end -- all because of the newly resurfaced reports about his  possible misconduct in Ukraine  that ""first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race."" The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee made the claim as  The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll  showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren  surging ahead of Biden  as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. Biden held a 9-point lead over Warren in the poll as recently as June. Indeed, the whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he  privately threatened then-President Petro Poroshenko  that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS THERE WAS NO PRESSURE ""I said, 'You're not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'"" ""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And, they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. And earlier this year, The Hill  reported  that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros. WATCH: POMPEO DEFENDS TRUMP AMID WHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGATION Then, in April, Ukrainian law enforcement officials said they had a  slew of evidence of collusion and wrongdoing by Democrats , and that they'd been trying to share this information with U.S. officials in the Justice Department. A  2017 investigation by Politico  found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory. Trump  told Fox News  that the allegations of possible Clinton-Ukraine collusion were ""big"" and vowed the DOJ would review them. ""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better."" ""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who claimed Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy. Meanwhile, Biden on Saturday denied he has ever spoken to Hunter about his business in Ukraine and called Trump's actions an ""overwhelming abuse of power."" WATCH: LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS NO ONE HAS REALLY LOOKED INTO BIDENS AND THEIR DEALINGS IN UKRAINE ""Trump’s doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum, and he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" Biden  told reporters in Iowa . Trump, on Sunday, pointed out that Biden's claim was seemingly inaccurate. Hunter Biden told the  New Yorker  previously that he and his father had spoken ""just once"" about it. ""And now, he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,"" Trump said. ""Of course you spoke to your son!"" Trump added: ""No quid pro quo, there was nothing. It was a perfect conversation. ... The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine, and Ukraine has got a lot of problems. The new president is saying that he's going to be able to rid the country of corruption and I said that would be a great thing, we had a great conversation."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump went on to say the latest allegations are ""just as ridiculous as the others,"" branding it ""the Ukraine Witch Hunt"" — a nod to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. ""Will fail again!"" Trump tweeted. Fox News' Ronn Blitzer, Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"The deals in question took place while Joe Biden was vice president and conducting official government business in those countries; Doug McKelway reports from Washington. WASHINGTON -- In June, two months after  Joe Biden  launched his  2020 campaign for president , The New Yorker published what many saw as a pre-emptive inoculation against his son's many troubles that might damage Biden’s campaign. In the piece , the recovering Hunter Biden acknowledged a longtime addiction to cocaine and alcohol. He also acknowledged frequenting prostitutes, and having other marital difficulties. The New Yorker also detailed Hunter's two questionable business deals, including a $1.5 billion donation from a Chinese businessman to a private equity firm, BHR Partners, on whose board Hunter sat. UKRAINE CONTROVERSY TURNS INTO DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR BIDEN ""Hunter became an unpaid member of BHR’s board but did not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after his father left the White House,"" The New Yorker said. The president's attorney,  Rudy Giuliani , maintained in a  fiery accusation on Fox News  Sunday that the money was donated days after the younger Biden flew with his father to China aboard Air Force Two. ""When he comes back ... eight days later, the kid gets a billion dollars in his ridiculous private equity fund run by a recovering drug addict,"" he said. President Trump has faced a whirlwind of criticism following accusations that he tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family dealings, using military aid as leverage. But the controversy has also renewed scrutiny on the Biden family's questionable business dealings. A second private equity firm founded by Biden received $3.4 million from a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings. Burisma Holdings also paid Hunter up to $50,000 a month to sit on its board. GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN Giuliani said when Ukrainian prosecutors  investigated Burisma Holdings for corruption, then-Vice President Joe Biden pressured the government to fire its head prosecutor. ""When Biden got the prosecutor fired, the new prosecutor who Biden approved -- you don’t get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country unless something fishy is going on -- the new prosecutor dropped the case,"" Giuliani said. The Biden camp maintains Giuliani is wrong -- that Biden, as well as other Western leaders and the International Monetary Fund, wanted the prosecutor fired because he wasn't aggressive enough in investigating the pro-Russian head of Ukraine's natural resources ministry, Mykola Zlochevsky, who also secretly headed Burisma Holdings through shell companies. It was only after the Ukraine government changed hands in a popular anti-Russian uprising that Hunter Biden was appointed to the board. There wasn't a hint ""of scandal at all when we were there and I impose the same strict rules,"" Joe Biden said last August. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Separately, Joe Biden's brother, James Biden, is also  being sued for conspiracy  to defraud a business partner. ""James Biden repeatedly would try to leverage his brother Joe Biden's connections ... connections to the court systems, connections to labor unions, connections to the Department of Veterans Affairs with the hopes that ... he could get my clients lucrative contracts. But none of these promises were fulfilled,"" the plaintiff’s attorney Robert Peal, told Fox News. An attorney representing James Biden did not respond to Fox News' request for a response. Joe Biden and his family have denied any impropriety. ""I have never discussed with my son or my brother or anyone else anything having to do with our businesses. Period,"" Joe Biden said in August. The New Yorker reported in its June piece that Hunter Biden declined a second term on Burisma Holdings' board, and that his decision to serve on the board during a first term was a mistake. ""It certainly wasn’t worth the grief,” he said. ""I would never have been able to predict that Donald Trump would have picked me out as the tip of the spear against the one person they believe can beat them.”"
"This kind of stunning evidence of the President abusing his power is the reason that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi finally took the major step of  throwing her full support  behind the impeachment inquiry. The six committees currently investigating President Trump are now operating under one umbrella with the official mandate of determining whether to vote for articles of impeachment. Should they end up taking this vote, Trump would join a small list that includes only three other presidents who have faced impeachment since the establishment of the country (Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and William J. Clinton).  The President has struck back in predictable fashion. ""A total Witch Hunt!"" and ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"" were some of the first words to come in over the  Twitter transom . A number of Republicans have already joined him.  At the heart of the counterattack is the claim that impeachment is a radical action. The entire process, Republicans will likely continue to say, is being driven by a Democratic party motivated by its left-wing base. Trump will try to defeat Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats as  President Clinton  prevailed over Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republicans  in 1998 .  If Democrats want to retain the support of their moderate wing who have joined this cause and desire to stand any chance of winning over Republican support in the House or Senate, they will need to respond to these charges of harassment. Fortunately for Speaker Pelosi, in the case of Trump, supporters of impeachment have a series of cogent arguments to make to convince GOP members of Congress.    While much of the discussion has centered around the Democrats, the spotlight should be on the GOP. They are the party being tested. And there are four reasons why there is a clear conservative case for the impeachment of President Trump.  1. Restraining the power of presidents  Restraining presidential power should be a top priority for conservatives. Few recent presidents have exercised their power with the same level of reckless abandon as the current commander in chief. If Republicans mean what they say about championing limited government, then there really is no justification for the party's decisions since the time of Richard Nixon to continue granting power to the executive branch when their party was in power. Simply put, further empowering the President means growing the role of government. The fact that the President has so much authority, from the ability to send troops into combat without a Congressional declaration of war to using executive measures to achieve policy goals like building a wall, does not square with their agenda.  Unlikely as it may seem, supporting impeachment is an unprecedented opportunity to reverse course on their hypocrisy and re-embody their own ideals. Trump has exposed, more than almost any of his recent predecessors, just how much a president can do if they are willing to ignore basic norms and if they are not scared about the potential response from Congress or the courts. Supporting the impeachment process, and possibly a decision to impeach and convict, could allow Republicans to go on record showing that they still do believe in small government. 2. Protecting national security Protecting national security has also been a central goal of the conservative movement. During the 1980s, for instance, President Ronald Reagan railed against Democrats for being weak on defense as he pushed for higher defense spending and insisted on taking a tough stand with the Soviets. George W. Bush pushed for a proactive militaristic response to terrorist networks as well as states that he claimed threatened American interests. Yet President Trump has not done much to uphold this tradition. His coziness with Vladmir Putin has frustrated intelligence and military officials who understand that Russia has been conducting ongoing efforts to interfere in our electoral system.  The President has handled relations with North Korea in topsy-turvy fashion, doing little to produce an actual nuclear weapons agreement or halt North Korea's weapons production. His efforts to  persuade Ukraine , possibly withholding military aid as an incentive to investigate Trump's 2020 rival Joe Biden, have inspired similar fears. All of this prompted seven moderate Democrats who are veterans of the military to publish their  Washington Post  piece endorsing the impeachment inquiry.  3. Standing up for the rule of law Republicans have also loved to imagine that they are the party of law and order. Ever since Richard Nixon's time in office, they have tried to assure voters that they are the party that can be best trusted to follow the rule of law and to give law enforcement institutions all the support they need. Under the Trump administration, they have so far been sitting passively as a President ran roughshod over all the institutions they have claimed to champion. Throughout his presidency, Trump has peddled mendacity and offered disinformation contradicting solid intelligence data that has been collected on matters like Russia. He has repeatedly acted with disregard for the law, he's been accused of flagrantly obstructing justice while under investigation by Mueller and refused to cooperate fully with congressional oversight.  The current scandal was triggered by the fact that the administration did not share the whistleblower complaint with Congress, as is required by law. The accumulation of evidence that the President  does not abide by the rule of law  is overwhelming. Republicans can only show Americans they still care about this crucial aspect of our democracy if they cooperate with this investigation.    4. Mike Pence In addition to these three core conservative elements behind the impeachment investigation, Democrats looking to forge bipartisan accord can reiterate that if President Trump were impeached and convicted, he would be replaced by an extraordinarily conservative Republican -- Vice President Mike Pence -- who is arguably even more rightward than the President. So if this really is a left-wing effort to mount a coup, it is poorly conceived. Success would not change the balance of partisan power nor would it in any way moderate the agenda of the White House.    Based on the voluminous evidence that we already have of Trump's wrongdoing, there is a compelling argument that impeaching him could be the only way to demonstrate the GOP's genuine commitment to conservative principles. In some ways, the most damaging step the Republicans could take is to continue stifling the investigation and blindly defending the President even as most can see before their very eyes the way that he is running roughshod over everything they have claimed to stand for.

"""What I can tell you is that it is deeply troubling. It is quite disturbing. It lays out several elements of things that any member of Congress and, quite frankly, any American should be concerned about,"" Rep. Val Demings, a Florida Democrat, told CNN's John Berman on ""New Day.""  The whistleblower complaint filed to the intelligence community inspector general containing the allegations about Trump's conduct is still a mostly unknown document, even after it was sent to Congress on Wednesday afternoon. Demings, who along with other lawmakers reviewed the complaint on Wednesday, said she could not discuss details of the classified complaint. The complaint has been declassifed and could be released as soon as Thursday morning, three sources told CNN.  Demings did note that ""we all have to be suspicious of any deviation from norms for regular procedures and processes as it pertains to the storage of documents or official records."" On Wednesday,  The New York Times  reported that the complaint includes concerns about how the White House handled the records of a July conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  In her CNN interview, Demings said the complaint ""has multiple witnesses,"" adding that ""there is clearly a trail of evidence and witnesses that we can talk to and documents and other things that we can review"" based on the document.

"Dr. Marc Siegel weighs in on 2020 Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders' health care plan. It may be a winning ticket in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, but two new polls indicate "" Medicare-for-all "" is far from the right prescription in the general election race for the White House. Nearly two-thirds of Democratic primary voters questioned in a  new NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll  say they support a government-run single-payer Medicare-for-all style system that would replace existing private insurance. That plan is championed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the two progressive standard-bearers in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls. WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SAYS ABOUT MEDICARE BUY-INS AND MEDICARE FOR ALL But among all voters, support for such a plan plunges to just 41 percent. About 56 percent of registered voters oppose a ""Medicare-for-all"" plan that replaces private insurance. The poll, released Sunday, indicates that what two-thirds of all voters do like is allowing  a Medicare buy-in  for those under 65 years old. That’s in line with the public option being pitched by former Vice President Joe Biden. Currently, the taxpayer-funded program covers Americans 65 and older. The latest Fox News national poll  also points to the popularity of the Medicare buy-in plan, with 83 percent of Democratic primary voters saying they favor the plan, which would allow individuals to buy into the government-run system. Even 51 percent of Republicans agree.  Among all voters, 68 percent support a buy-in system. But support for a ""Medicare-for-all"" plan that replaces private insurance nosedives to 46 percent among all voters in the Fox News poll, which was released last week. Sen. Kamala Harris of California also supports Medicare-for-all, albeit with a role for private insurers. Health care has been a leading concern among Democratic primary voters, with the issue topping the past two primary debates.

"The hypocrisy is standard, says radio talk show host Tony Katz. Following a hearing held by the  Democrat-led  House Intelligence Committee to investigate possible impeachment charges against  President Trump  on Thursday, CNN's chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the proceeding lacked ""juice"" and may not have contained enough bite to move the needle. ""There was sort of an air of unreality about it because the complaint and the transcript, the partial transcript, have now been turned over,"" he said. ""So the fight didn’t really have that much juice to it. But that was really what the issue was about."" Toobin also defended acting Director of Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who told the committee he may have been given bad advice from the  Department of Justice  or the  White House  as to how to handle the whistleblower complaint levied against the president. ""The issue that the Democrats, in particular, were focusing on is why when the law says when there is a credible and urgent inspector general’s report — when the law says it shall be turned over to the Congress, why wasn’t it turned over right away?"" Toobin asked.

""So the question was, did he get really good and fair advice?"" Democrats moved forward with an impeachment investigation after Trump spoke with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky about initiating a probe into  Joe Biden  and his son Hunter.

"'Special Report' host Bret Baier weighs in on the push for impeachment, whistleblower complaint. A CNN news anchor went after President Trump on Wednesday, accusing the commander-in-chief of making ""baseless"" and ""100 percent wrong"" claims about former Vice President Joe Biden. Brooke Baldwin took issue with Trump after the president's bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following the release of a transcript of their conversation, during which he slammed Hunter Biden's alleged financial ties to Ukraine and China and repeated his call for an investigation. “When Biden’s son walks away with millions of dollars from Ukraine, he knows nothing, and they’re paying him millions of dollars, that’s corruption,” Trump said. “When Biden’s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund, and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China, and he’s there for one quick meeting, and he flies in on Air Force Two, I think that’s a horrible thing.” The president also knocked  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , claiming she is ""no longer the speaker"" as far as he's concerned after she formally launched an impeachment inquiry, which was demanded among the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. CNN GUEST BATTLES DON LEMON, RIPS NETWORK'S UKRAINE COVERAGE Baldwin immediately took exception to the swipe against Pelosi. ""OK, the last time I've checked, Nancy Pelosi is the speaker of the House, so I don't know what he's talking about there,""  Baldwi n said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The ""CNN Newsroom"" anchor then pivoted to the president's remarks about Biden. “Everything he said about the Bidens is 100 percent wrong,” Baldwin continued. “The accusations against the Bidens are baseless. There is no evidence of wrongdoing, including by Ukrainian prosecutors. Joe Biden is indeed on tape talking about withholding aid because the U.S. and Western nations wanted a corrupt prosecutor out. In fact, the goal of Western nations at the time was to get prosecutors who would investigate corruption. So, first and foremost, those are the facts.”"
"President Trump says his conversation with the Ukraine was perfect; he says Joe Biden made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son about his overseas business dealings. President Trump  answered questions Sunday morning regarding reports that a whistleblower complaint may have accused him of wrongdoing related to a July phone call with  Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and insisted that there was “absolutely nothing wrong” with the substance of the discussion. Trump reportedly has been accused of asking Ukraine’s leader multiple times to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, and using military aid as leverage. Trump denied making any improper requests. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE' “I said absolutely nothing wrong; it was perfect,” Trump said outside the White House before departing for Houston. “There was no quid pro quo, there was nothing,” he later added. Trump did point fingers at Biden, however. The Democratic presidential hopeful’s son Hunter Biden had been investigated related to business interests. Biden has said in the past that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden’s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. Trump accused Biden of being dishonest in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling the  New Yorker  that they spoke “just once” about it. “And now he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,” Trump said Sunday. “Of course you spoke to your son!” When asked about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump said it had nothing to do with the Biden family. ""Because I want Germany, and I want France, and I want the European Union to put up money,"" Trump said. ""And I didn't delay anything. We paid the military aid to the best of my knowledge."" BIDEN FACES SCRUTINY FOR DEMANDING OUSTER OF UKRAINE OFFICIAL PROBING FIRM THAT EMPLOYED HIS SON Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., doubted that Trump's conversation with Zelenskiy was innocent. ""Well if that’s the case, then why doesn’t the president simply release the transcript of that call?” Schiff said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Schiff also challenged Trump to allow the release of the whistleblower complaint, accusing Trump of not wanting to see either one. The Democratic congressman has long been a vocal critic of the president but has not been among those calling for his impeachment. Schiff said that may change in light of the reports of Trump's conversation with Ukraine. ""If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit … then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents.” Giuliani has acknowledged that he was involved in investigating Hunter Biden, but claimed that his original goal was to investigate ties between Ukraine and Democrats related to the 2016 election. He denied that he was specifically out to get Biden. “What they’re trying to say is I went there on a political mission to get Joe Biden in trouble,” Giuliani told “Fox News Sunday,” calling such a claim “ridiculous.” Giuliani said that the suspicion of Biden’s wrongdoing related to his son’s case was “inextricably linked” to what he had already been investigating related to the Democratic Party. “This is going to get bigger and bigger, and everything I say I can prove,” Giuliani said. Trump said he would be amenable to Giuliani discussing the matter before Congress. “I would have no problem,” the president said. “Rudy’s a straight shooter, and Rudy wants to see the same thing as a lot of other people when it comes to Ukraine.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also fielded questions about Ukraine on “Fox News Sunday,” but declined to get into specifics, only stating that Trump’s discussions with world leaders “have always been 100 percent appropriate, 100 percent lawful.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"
"New revelations, and now a previously-unseen interview, raising questions over former Vice President Joe  Biden's  account of his handling of Anita  Hill's  1991 sexual harassment allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence  Thomas . Biden chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation hearing of Thomas and the committee heard testimony from Thomas and Hill.  Biden has repeatedly  claimed  that he believed Hill from the very beginning and that he did everything in his power to keep Thomas from being confirmed. 'SPECIAL INTERESTS' WANTS TO TARNISH KAVANAUGH, AS THEY DID THOMAS: CLARENCE THOMAS ADVISER However, Biden's account is challenged in the Fox Nation documentary  'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching '  and now Fox Nation is releasing previously-unseen interviews elaborating on these claims. In  'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching ',  former Senator Orrin Hatch R-Utah, who sat on the 1991 Judiciary committee with Biden, told Fox Nation that Biden told him during the hearings that he 'didn’t believe [Hill].'"" Longtime Thomas adviser and radio host, Armstrong Williams told Fox Nation that ""Biden assured [Thomas], repeatedly on the phone and in person, 'Clarence, you will be confirmed.'"" Now, in new interview material, Williams said ""Joe Biden wanted to vote for Thomas – remember.  Joe Biden is getting grief right now because [of the way] they say he treated Anita Hill...by and large, the Southern Senators and Biden liked Thomas."" Thomas' nomination was eventually confirmed by a narrow majority of 52 to 48.  Biden voted against sending Thomas to the Supreme Court. “Biden was always confidentially talking to Thomas saying ‘I’m with you. I’m with you.’  That’s something that people don’t know.  Biden was very much encouraging him, behind the scenes. Telling him to hang in there...Behind the scenes, no one could have been more gracious than Biden,"" Williams continued. WOULD IT GO VIRAL TODAY? EXPLOSIVE TESTIMONY IN THOMAS/HILL SAGA: NEW DOC Biden's handling of the hearings has long been a point of contention for his critics, who fault Biden for not allowing more witnesses, supportive of Hill, to testify. In March, Biden  lamented  his apparent inability to provide a different forum for Hill to air her allegations. ""To this day I regret I couldn't come up with a way to give her the kind of hearing she deserved,"" Biden said at a New York City event honoring young people who helped combat sexual assault on college campuses. ""I wish I could have done something."" According to Williams, Biden pro-actively prevented witnesses from making allegations that Biden deemed unfounded. ""Well, there were people that wanted to testify, who had no credibility, that the other side was pushing for -- Biden never allowed them on the docket."" FLASHBACK: KAVANAUGH'S WIFE RESPONDS TO SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HER HUSBAND “I have a lot of respect for Biden.

I know conservatives are not going to like it, but as far as I'm concerned Biden was always decent,"" said Williams. Williams also acknowledged that his account may not be politically-advantageous to Biden. “I had no issue with Biden during that process.  Biden did all he could – this may not help him on-camera – Biden did all he could to be fair to Judge Thomas at the time.  He could not have been more gracious and more communicative with the Justice at the time, and he apologized profusely.  He felt so bad [about] what was happening to him and these allegations.” 'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching'  is available exclusively on  Fox Nation.

"The whistleblower complaint calls into question the validity of the Trump-Ukraine call transcript. Two sections of the publicly released report have been redacted; Catherine Herridge reports. The whistleblower  complaint  that touched off a political tempest in Washington was released to the public Thursday, alleging  President Trump  used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election -- and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call. The rough transcript of the July call, between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, was already released a day earlier by the White House. It confirmed that Trump sought an investigation from Ukraine into the Biden family, though did not show the president explicitly leveraging U.S. aid as had initially been suggested in some media reports. But the whistleblower complaint, released by the Democrat-led House Intelligence Committee ahead of testimony from Acting  Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire , goes further, though it is not a first-hand account of the call. The whistleblower, who remains anonymous, says in the complaint that White House officials who heard the call were ""deeply disturbed"" by it, and that White House lawyers discussed how to handle the call ""because of the likelihood, in the officials' retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain."" READ THE COMPLAINT    The document is sure to fuel the impeachment inquiry formally launched by House Democrats earlier this week. Trump, though, has maintained he did nothing wrong. ""THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!"" Trump tweeted Thursday. White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement that, ""Nothing has changed with the release of this complaint."" She described it as ""nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings—all of which shows nothing improper,"" adding Trump ""has nothing to hide.""  The complaint cites “multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call"" and accuses Trump of attempting “to pressure the Ukranian leader to take actions to help the President’s 2020 reelection bid.” Going beyond the details revealed in the transcript, the complaint then presents allegations that the White House tried to ""restrict access"" to records of the call. ""In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced--as is customary--by the White House Situation Room,"" the complaint says. The complaint goes on to allege that White House officials said they were ""directed"" by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept. Instead, the transcript was allegedly kept on a different system normally used for classified information. The whistleblower says that, according to White House officials, it was ""not the first time"" a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national security-sensitive information. TRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALLEGES BIDEN CORRUPTION, SAYS DEMS THREATENED UKRAINE AID MULTIPLE TIMES The White House released a record of the call Wednesday, confirming a request from Trump for Ukraine to assist Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani in investigating Joe Biden's efforts to have Ukraine's former top prosecutor fired. It also shows, as the complaint alleges, that Trump intended for Attorney General Bill Barr to be involved in this investigation as well. Republicans maintain that the questions about Biden's intervention are legitimate. Biden  has acknowledged   on camera  that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire that prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm  Burisma Holdings  — where Hunter Biden had a  highly lucrative role  on the board paying him tens of thousands of dollars per month, despite limited relevant expertise. Shokin himself had been widely accused of corruption, though. Still,  critics charged  that Hunter Biden might have been essentially selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. The complaint cites articles from The Hill, in which Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko alleged that Biden pushed for Shokin's termination to put an end to the Burisma investigation, that other Ukrainian officials had ""interfered"" in the 2016 presidential election by working with the Democratic National Committee, and that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev kept Ukrainian prosecutors from going to the U.S with evidence related to the election. The complaint notes that Lutsenko had expressed a desire to discuss these allegations with Barr. Trump made the request on the July call for Ukraine to look into the Bidens after Zelensky first mentioned Ukraine's corruption issues, and after Trump separately requested as a ""favor"" that Ukraine  help investigate foreign interference in the 2016 elections , including the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server involving the data security company CrowdStrike. WHISTLEBLOWER LAWYERS WORK WITH NONPROFIT TO LAUNCH GOFUNDME PAGE SEEKING $100G AHEAD OF POSSIBLE TESTIMONY The complaint goes on to say that the day after the call, U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker went to Kiev and met with Zelensky and other Ukrainian figures. The whistleblower says that ""[b]ased on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me by various U.S. officials,"" Volker and U.S. European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland gave Zelensky advice ""about how to 'navigate' the demands that the President had made of [Zelensky]."" The complaint drew criticism from Republicans after it was reported that that whistleblower did not have first-hand knowledge of the call. The Intelligence Community Inspector General’s office also found that the whistleblower showed “some indicia of an arguable political bias” favoring “a rival political candidate.” The IG’s office did, however, determine that the allegation in the complaint “appears credible.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Another incident described in the complaint is an Aug. 2 meeting in Madrid between Giuliani and a Zelensky adviser, which U.S. officials said was a ""direct follow-up"" to Trump's phone call. The Justice Department has since examined the call and determined that Trump's requests from Ukraine did not rise to the level of an in-kind contribution to his presidential campaign that warranted further investigation. Fox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report."
"After House Democrats took the extraordinary step this week of initiating a formal  impeachment inquiry , numerous questions have arisen about the  complicated process , and how it could play out for President Trump.  We  asked  readers what they wanted to know about the inquiry and received nearly 1,500 questions. Our reporters in Washington have answered a selection. Which Laws Were Broken? Could someone explain which specific law, or laws, Trump’s request to the Ukrainian president regarding investigating Biden’s son would violate? Are there different laws implicated if it is proven that Trump withheld funds in order to encourage the investigation? What about if the attorney general was involved? — Janine Marie Connell, High Falls, N.Y. A  version of a legal determination  released by the Justice Department points to an allegation that Mr. Trump may have violated a law that prohibits the solicitation of an illegal foreign campaign contribution, which doesn’t necessarily mean money, it  can also mean a “thing of value.” But it’s also worth noting that when it comes to impeachment, the president need not have committed a violation of an ordinary criminal statute to have committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.” That term came out of the British common law tradition and essentially means an abuse of power by a high-level public official. Arguing for the ratification of the Constitution in 1788,  Alexander Hamilton described  impeachable crimes as “those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.” —  Charlie Savage The Democrats’ Goals Given everything we know about the Senate, how likely is it that Trump will be removed from office? Is pursuing an impeachment inquiry to remove Trump from power more of an effort to effectively remove him from office or is it more useful in promoting a negative view of the president in the eyes of the public? — Daniel Vance, Washington Considering the Republican majority in the Senate, it seems very unlikely that Mr. Trump would be convicted in that chamber if ultimately impeached by the House because it would require 67 votes to remove him. That means a minimum of 20 Republicans would have to break to join all 47 Democrats to oust the president. Senate Republicans have been mainly steadfast in their support of the president thus far.  House Democrats say they are motivated more by what they see as their constitutional obligation to hold Mr. Trump accountable for misconduct rather than force him from office given Republican control of the Senate.  — Carl Hulse The Republicans’ Response Are there any Republicans in the House who support impeachment, or launching an impeachment investigation? As I recall in 1974, there were Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee who voted for impeaching Nixon. It would be interesting to compare the Republicans of 1974 with those of 2019. — Jeff Wood, River Forest, Ill. So far, no House Republican has stepped forward to support the impeachment inquiry, and it is doubtful any will. Representative Justin Amash of Michigan earlier said that impeachment should be considered after the release of the special counsel’s report. He was essentially driven out of the party and is now an independent.  It is correct that in 1974, some high-ranking Republicans confronted President Richard M. Nixon over Watergate and advised him to step aside. In other scandals, it has been pressure from the president’s own party that has shifted the tide. No evidence of Republicans abandoning Mr. Trump is visible at this point.  — Carl Hulse The Impeachment Process If the House votes to impeach but the Senate does not vote to remove Trump from office, what then happens? Does he remain in office even though he was officially impeached? — Pearl Sullivan, Atlanta Yes. Think of impeachment as somewhat akin to a criminal indictment. After impeachment, the Senate holds a trial to determine guilt and decide whether to remove the president from office. Take Bill Clinton. He was impeached in 1998 but was ultimately acquitted by the Senate and completed his term in office. Ditto Andrew Johnson in 1868. Mr. Nixon resigned in 1974 to avoid being impeached. — Sharon LaFraniere During an impeachment inquiry, are there any limits placed on the president? — Dawn Standera, Minnesota No. The government goes on as usual, although it is hard to imagine the president working with Democratic members of Congress to pass any significant legislation while impeachment looms over him. — Sharon LaFraniere Why is it “not O.K.” to indict a sitting president but O.K. to impeach? — Wendy Griswold, Jupiter, Fla. According to the prevailing opinion by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, a sitting president cannot be indicted. But the Constitution permits Congress to remove a president before a term is up if enough lawmakers decide that “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors” were committed. — Sharon LaFraniere Ukraine and the Bidens Has anyone interviewed the Ukrainian president regarding this matter, and if not, why not? — Kay Juricek, Denver President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is not granting interviews at this time, but he did answer some questions at an appearance on Wednesday at the United Nations. With Mr. Trump by his side,  Mr. Zelensky said  the call was “normal,” and that “nobody pushed me.” He added, “I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved in the democratic elections of U.S.A.” Mr. Zelensky finds himself in a very delicate and tricky position. He badly needs the support of the Trump administration to combat Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. At the same time, he wants to present his government, only months old, as independent and not under anyone’s thumb. — Sharon LaFraniere Do we know what Joe Biden did for his son Hunter? What has Giuliani been reaching for? — High Chapparal, Albuquerque Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, and other Trump allies claim that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. used his position in 2015 to demand that Ukraine oust its top prosecutor in order to protect his son Hunter Biden. At the time, Hunter Biden was on the board of an energy company led by an oligarch, Mykola Zlochevsky, who had been under investigation. But no evidence has emerged that Mr. Biden acted to shield his son. Many Western institutions and governments, including the United States, were demanding that Ukraine oust the prosecutor because he was corrupt. And the Obama administration supported criminal investigations of the oligarch. — Sharon LaFraniere The Role of the Senate If the House approves articles of impeachment, is Mitch McConnell required to hold an impeachment trial? What is the timing on when he would have to do so? — Mark Schmidt, Rochester, N.Y. The Constitution clearly envisions that the Senate will hold a trial if the House votes for impeachment. But if Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, simply refuses to do that, there is no obvious enforcement mechanism to make him. — Sharon LaFraniere If the House votes to impeach President Trump, will the Senate have the right to question President Trump under oath or will the Republican majority (Senate) be able to block that? Would it be open testimony or behind closed doors testimony? — Bruce Monteith, Calabasas, Calif. As my colleague Charlie Savage  has written , there are no set rules. The Senate has to pass a resolution that lays out the procedures for a trial. Bob Barr, a former Republican congressman from Georgia, who served as a kind of prosecutor during the Senate trial of Mr. Clinton, put it this way: “Impeachment is a creature unto itself.” — Sharon LaFraniere The So-Called Transcript How can we verify that this is an accurate transcript of the phone call between Mr. Trump and the president of Ukraine? — Nancy Story Somers, Cogan Station, Pa. The document released Wednesday, known officially as a “memorandum of telephone conversation,” includes a cautionary note that it is “not a verbatim transcript” and is based off the notes and recollections of people who listened to the call. As such, it is not 100 percent clear that the words in the document were the ones used.  But Trump administration officials also said that voice recognition software was used in reconstructing the dialogue between the two leaders. That provides more assurance that the conversation is accurate. — Michael D. Shear Is there a verbatim version of the transcript? — William Bagnai, San Diego As far as we know, there is no verbatim transcript, and it is not clear whether an audio recording exists of the telephone call. — Michael D. Shear The Role of Rudy Giuliani How important is it that Giuliani is the president’s personal lawyer, not an official of the government? Should a private citizen be involved in carrying out foreign relations? — Mary Jo Moss, Corydon, Ind. It is quite important and very messy. Although Mr. Giuliani is not a federal official, foreign officials are very likely to see him as speaking for the president, just as if he were part of the administration. This blurring of roles is actually more typical of countries like Russia than the United States. An obscure federal law  known as the Logan Act , which dates to 1799, prohibits private citizens from interfering with the conduct American foreign policy without the government’s approval. But no one has ever been convicted of violating the act. And in any case, because Mr. Giuliani was acting on the president’s behalf, he presumably had the required governmental blessing. Although Mr. Trump has praised Mr. Giuliani’s efforts, criticism has nonetheless been widespread and intense. Here’s just one example: “It is certainly highly inappropriate for a private citizen to get involved in these international affairs and to in effect aid and abet the president in getting a foreign government interfere in our elections,” said Evelyn Farkas, a senior fellow with the German Marshall Fund. — Sharon LaFraniere The Whistle-Blower Is it the normal process for the Justice Department and White House to weigh in and hold back a whistle-blower complaint? Does it normally go directly to Congress? — Patricia Hall, South Carolina While administration officials may consult with the Justice Department on matters like how to handle an intelligence community whistle-blower complaint, such complaints generally go directly to Congress. Bradley P. Moss, a lawyer who specializes in whistle-blower issues, called the Ukraine matter “unprecedented.” — Katie Benner A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the  Reader Center  does not count toward your monthly free article limit.

"But one thing got lost in all of the coverage of what Trump said on the call. And that missing piece was what Zelensky said. What was it? Over-the-top praise of Trump at every turn.  Of his recent victory, Zelensky told Trump: ""We worked a lot but I would like to confess to you that I had an opportunity to learn from you. We used quite a few of your skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example for our elections and yes it is true that these were unique elections."" Of Trump's claim that the US does more for Ukraine than other European allies, Zelensky said: ""Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100%, but actually 1000%."" Of Trump's questioning of the Ukraine ambassador to the US, Zelensky said of his new appointee: ""I would also like and hope to see him having your trust and your confidence and have personal relations with you so we can cooperate even more so."" And, he added this: ""It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%."" Then, apropos of nothing, Zelensky told Trump this: ""Actually last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower."" Why so much praise for Trump from Zelensky? Does he just really admire the US President? I mean, maybe? Or maybe Zelensky has figured out -- or been told by his aides -- that the way to Trump's heart is through lavish praise. ""The leaders of virtually every country that I met at the G-20 congratulated me on our great economy,""  Trump tweeted in June . And in February,  he said this : ""Whenever I greet a prime minister or a president, or any leaders of any countries, they always start off by saying, 'Congratulations on your economy. It's been incredible. Congratulations.'"" And so, in order to curry favor with Trump -- and hopefully advance Ukraine's interests vis a vis America -- Zelensky lays it on as thick as possible, knowing that there is no such thing as ""too much"" when it comes to praising Trump. The Point : If you think world leaders aren't aware of how they can get into Trump's good graces, you are drastically underestimating world leaders."

Former White House senior advisor Karl Rove criticized Democrats Tuesday for pursuing  impeachment , saying it'll only hurt them.

Rove not only argued that impeachment would put Biden's Ukraine roll into question but also bring other issues to the surface, ""Remember it's not only Hunter Biden who gets hired, Devon Archer, a longtime family friend of then-Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts also gets put on the board of Burisma,"" Rove said.

"""Because of your campaign, I feel like I can be myself,"" the 16-year-old, who has autism,  told Buttigieg after his remarks. ""I can go to school and talk about what I believe in, and I don't have to be ashamed of who I am."" Since that meeting, Buttigieg has shared that story on the trail on stops in New Hampshire and South Carolina. But his stop here in Clinton on Tuesday, as part of his bus tour through the state, was the first time Buttigieg reunited with the young supporter. ""This is a very special appearance because I'm being reunited with somebody whose story I've been sharing lately,"" Buttigieg told the audience. ""And I'm proud to know that a campaign can help her feel like she can stand up tall and be who she is. Because that means that, long before the first vote is even cast, we are creating that kind of culture of belonging that every one of our supporters can spread, that everyone who is here can go out and spread to others, to let everybody know where you fit."" Bissell said Buttigieg sharing their meeting on the trail has changed her life, too. ""Seeing someone just important, talk about it and all of that, it really makes me feel validated,"" Bissell told CNN Tuesday. ""And I really hope that it helps validate other people with autism and other disabilities and things like that to be themselves too."" Bissell's mother, Suzanne, has found herself moved by Buttigieg's campaign too. ""For him to have seen the light that we always have seen in Bridget is pretty amazing,"" Suzanne Bissell told CNN. ""To not only hear her and listen to her, but then to remember it. I mean, he sees thousands of people."" Bissell, who homeschools her daughter, says she's proud of her daughter's courage. ""We used to practice with looking people in the eye and she now has the confidence to talk to Pete, to a presidential candidate, and to admit her scariest secret ever, that she has autism. She had never told anybody publicly until that day that she had it. And so, it's huge."" Buttigieg invited the Bissells on board his campaign bus after his Clinton town hall for a tour. There, he chatted with his young supporter, and they bonded over their shared love of music, including the clarinet, which Buttigieg played in high school and Bridgette Bissell enjoys. ""It obviously means a lot to know that the things that she's going through in life are easier,"" Buttigieg told reporters after his campaign stop in Clinton. ""That it's better because of what we're doing. And I think in many ways it reminds us why we're doing it."" ""It was really, really touching to talk to obviously see Bridgette, but also to talk to her mom about what this means. And it's also a reminder about how much more is at stake in the presidency than just policy. I mean, policy is a huge dimension of what government is about. But it's not the only thing the presidency is responsible for. Just by virtue of being the most visible person in the country, you can help or harm so many people in so many ways."" For her part, Bridgette Bissell is excited to have shaped a presidential campaign with her own story. ""That makes me feel so proud, and love, and validated, because I struggle a lot with doubts, with doubts about myself,"" she told CNN. ""The reason why I support him is that he shows everybody's voice is important. It doesn't matter who you love, what your gender is, anything, how, what your ability level is. It doesn't matter. You have a voice and it matters."" As for what's next for the Bissells? They're all in for Buttigieg now, Suzanne Bissell says. She hails from El Paso, Texas, the hometown of another 2020 Democratic candidate, Beto O'Rourke, but after meeting Buttigieg, ""there was no other candidate"" for her. ""I've never been political ever, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to help him,"" she told CNN. ""Like we're going to have a party at our house for him and invite friends. That's not something I usually do. I'm kind of a private, I don't like to talk about politics with friends, but I'm willing to do it for him."""
"Good morning and welcome to  Fox News First .  Here's what you need to know as you start your day ... Flurry of House Dems back Trump impeachment inquiry as reports say Trump froze Ukraine aid 
Just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching President Trump,  a slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry . The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came as the New York Times, the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine ""in the days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate the Democrats’ leading presidential candidate,"" Joe Biden. Fox News has not confirmed that report, which was attributed to two senior administration officials. An official told the Wall Street Journal that the Trump administration internally maintained at the time that Ukraine's corruption problems were a consideration in the aid decision. Trump's decision to freeze Ukraine funding reportedly came more than a week before his call with Zelensky. Leaders of the House Democrats, meanwhile, scheduled a meeting for Tuesday afternoon on how to handle the explosive whistleblower complaint concerning the president's phone call with the Ukrainian president this past July.

The escalating controversy over President Trump’s phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  has ignited a battle on Capitol Hill  over Democrats’ demands for a copy of the whistleblower complaint against Trump, as some liberal lawmakers threatened subpoenas while Republicans called for restraint while they gather facts. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, but Democrats have been moving full steam ahead, calling for the whistleblower complaint to be released to lawmakers. Republicans say Democrats are playing politics, seizing on allegations that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate dealings involving Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, to revive the push for impeachment. Meanwhile, a source told Fox News that the  whistleblower who sparked a mounting controversy did not have “firsthand knowledge”  of the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president.  In an exclusive interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity , Vice President Mike Pence blasted the media over its coverage of the Ukrainian controversy. The media, Pence said, have been relentless in their condemnation Trump while ignoring the allegations of ""quid-pro-quo"" against Joe Biden.

As the Ukrainian whistleblower controversy brews, President Trump is preparing to call for a multi-national response to Iran's escalating aggression when he goes before the U.N. General Assembly in New York City on Tuesday. While Trump wants allies to join the U.S. in further isolating Iran, he also seems to be holding to his go-it-alone strategy of using economic sanctions to pressure Tehran to give up its nuclear program and stop attacks that are rattling the Middle East. On Monday, the president praised British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's call for a new deal to replace the 2015 Iran nuclear pact from which Trump walked away. Trump was expected to use his speech to blame Iran for recent strikes against oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. Iran has denied orchestrating the attack, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has deemed ""an act of war."" Britain, France and Germany joined the United States on Monday in blaming Iran for the attacks. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, for his part, pointed to claims of responsibility by Yemeni rebels.  - Reported by the Associated Press

       DNC raises qualifying thresholds for November debate The Democratic National Committee is raising the bar for presidential candidates  to qualify for November’s fifth-round primary debate. The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates. But, the upping of polling and donor thresholds – more modest than the doubling of the criteria from July’s second round to this month’s third round – may not significantly winnow the field of White House contenders still standing after October’s debate.

"The 30-second spot -- titled ""Your Choice"" -- heralds Buttigieg's ""Medicare for All Who Want It"" plan that would not force people onto government health coverage but instead would offer a public option for people who choose to enroll, a key distinction with the sweeping overhaul that would be instituted under a fully Medicare for All program. ""Providing every single American with quality health insurance isn't just my plan, it's our cause,"" Buttigieg  says straight to the camera . ""Now, I go about it in a very different way than my competitors."" The South Bend, Indiana, mayor goes on to tout how his plan ""gives everybody access to Medicare. Everybody. But, if you're happy with the private insurance you've got my plan would let you stick with it -- if you want."" ""Now, others say it's Medicare for All, or nothing,"" Buttigieg says, a not-so-subtle nod to Sanders, Warren and other pro-Medicare for All Democrats. ""I approve this message to say, the choice should be yours."" Buttigieg  released his own health care plan  earlier this month that allows people to opt into a government-backed health insurance option but lets them keep their private insurance plans if they like them. Buttigieg has long used health care as a way to draw distinctions with other Democrats. He used the third Democratic debate to question Sanders directly about his plan, turning to the senator and asking, ""I trust the American people to make the right choice for them. Why don't you?"" And during his recent four-day trip through Iowa, Buttigieg told audiences that his opponents want Medicare for All ""whether you want it or not, and I think we can improve on that."" But the television ad, part of Buttigieg's third ad buy in the state, is the clearest sign that the mayor plans to make his diverging health care plan central to his critique of his Democratic opponents. Buttigieg, in a nod to the popularity among Democratic activists around Medicare for All, has said a single-payer system is a good long-term goal, but that Americans should not be forced to lose their private health insurance in the process. This is not the first time Buttigieg has put money behind a health care spot. The mayor has also been sponsoring a post on Facebook that says, ""Medicare for All Who Want It will create a public alternative, but unlike the Sanders-Elizabeth Warren vision it doesn't dictate it to the American people and risk further polarizing them."" Another ad simply states, ""I trust the American people to make their health care decisions for themselves."" Buttigieg finds himself in fourth place in Iowa, according to a  recent CNN/Des Moines Register poll of Iowa . The mayor is at 9% with likely Democratic caucusgoers, compared to 22% for Warren, 20% for Biden and 11% for Sanders. Buttigieg's team received good news in  a recent Monmouth survey , where 56% of New Hampshire Democrats and unaffiliated voters likely to participate in the Democratic primary said their preferred approach to health care reform is a public option in addition to private insurance, while 23% said they wanted to replace private insurance with a single public plan like ""Medicare for All."" CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that Buttigieg's ad will air in Iowa on Wednesday."

"Fox Nation hosts Diamond &amp; Silk come to President Trump's defense on 'Fox &amp; Friends.' Fox Nation's   Diamond & Silk  weighed in on former NBA player  Charles Barkley  slamming  Democrats'  for their lack of action in the black community and accusing them of taking the black vote for granted. ""Let me just tell you this here, when it comes to Democrats listening, they promise on everything and they deliver on nothing,"" said Diamond on  ""Fox & Friends."" TRUMP TOUTS HISTORICALLY LOW LEVEL OF AFRICAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT Diamond also blasted some Democrats for pushing for reparations for African-Americans, which has recently become a talking point amongst 2020 Democrats. ""Look at how they're promising reparations, black people don't need reparations, they need liberation from the Democrat party,"" Diamond said. The duo agreed largely with Barkley, who went after Democrats for allegedly only paying attention to black voters around election time. CHARLES BARKLEY JOKES ABOUT JUSSIE SMOLLETT, LIAM NEESON CONTROVERSIES DURING TNT'S NBA HALFTIME SHOW ""They’ve been taking black people’s votes – and they only talk to black people every four years. All of these politicians only talk to black people every four years because they want their vote,"" Barkley  said  in an interview aired Wednesday. He added that he thought Republicans didn't talk to black voters and that Democrats did ""nothing in the four years in between."" ""Fox & Friends"" host Brian Kilmeade agreed with Barkley, and called on Republicans to further their efforts in the black community, but Diamond and Silk pointed to President Trump's actions in response. ""When it comes to the Republican party, we have a Republican president. He's not all talk, he takes action,"" Diamond said, referencing the  historically low black unemployment rate  and Trump's commitment to the  First Step Act. ""So...Republicans don't have to pander, because they deliver...our Republican president...is delivering,"" she continued. Silk said she hoped black people would have a ""come to Jesus moment"" and that they would ""realize that the Democrat party mean black people no good."" Reiterating Diamond's support for Trump, Silk said the president is helping the black community by ""leading by example."" ""The president is doing what he needs to do when it comes down to black people by showing people this is what you need for the black community."" ""You need jobs so you can take care of your family,"" Silk continued, ""instead of talking about it, he's 'being about it,'  and that's why black people are waking up to it.""

"Georgia Republican Rep. Doug Collins weighs in on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. He says instead of governing, Democrats are abusing the rules of the House to make a political statement. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., said on Wednesday that there is not yet a formal  impeachment inquiry  against President Trump over events surrounding a  phone call  involving the president of Ukraine. “What’s really happening here is nothing except the perpetration of fiction among the voters of America,” Collins told  “Fox & Friends,”  challenging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to move forward officially. “If she wants to do it, she needs to bring it to the floor,"" he said. A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that the whistleblower had no firsthand knowledge of Trump's July call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump, who has been accused of trying to pressure Zelensky to investigate the family of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of the call by Wednesday. WH TO RELEASE DOCUMENT SHOWING INTEL COMMUNITY WATCHDOG FOUND WHISTLEBLOWER HAD 'POLITICAL BIAS,' OFFICIAL SAYS “What they want them to believe is they’re up here doing something that they are not, simply because they hate this president. They cannot stand the fact that he’s leading, that he’s actually doing stuff for our country and that they can’t defeat that,” Collins said. He said when it comes to impeachment, Pelosi ""is not a leader,"" but is following liberals in her caucus like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. A senior administration official  told Fox News  there are a “few words” in the transcript that will raise eyebrows, but it is nowhere near as inflammatory as Democrats have suggested. BIDEN'S UKRAINE DEALINGS - 7 ESSENTIAL FACTS  “I know for the Democrats if it says ‘the,' 'and,' or a pronoun, they’re going to say it raises eyebrows because all they’ve wanted to actually do is impeach this president,” Collins said. The contents of the call, as well as the whistleblower complaint, could throw cold water on Democrats' explosive suggestions that the president improperly threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine unless it investigated Biden and his son, Hunter. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Republicans had predicted over the weekend that such an impeachment inquiry could backfire on Pelosi, and administration officials have said Trump was concerned only with broader corruption in Ukraine. Fox News’ Gregg Re, John Roberts, Ed Henry contributed to this report."
"""As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid. But my complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they're not doing it,"" Trump said Tuesday as he arrived at the United Nations ahead of his speech to the General Assembly. Trump  remained defiant Tuesday that he's done nothing wrong  and has no regrets about his behavior when it comes to Ukraine and seeking an investigation into Biden's son's dealings. On Monday,  The Washington Post first reported  that the  President had directed his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney  to freeze nearly $400 million of US military and security aid to Ukraine in the days before he spoke with Zelensky. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Later Tuesday, when pressed again on why he blocked aid to Ukraine ahead of the call, Trump emphasized that other countries should contribute and noted that the aid was ultimately paid.  ""Nobody has given, I believe, more to Ukraine ... We think it is very important. And by the way, I don't know if you know it or not but that payment was made,"" Trump said during a bilateral meeting with embattled British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""But I wanted to get other countries -- other countries should also pay because, frankly, it affects them more,"" the President added. Trump said he took these concerns to acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.  Other countries should contribute, Trump said, which he claimed led to the delay in Ukraine aid. ""So I said hold it up. Let's get other people to pay. And then everybody called me, 'Oh please, can we pay?' And there was never any quid pro quo,"" he said.  Asked his reaction to the growing momentum toward impeachment, Trump again borrowed a phrase from his characterization of the Mueller investigation: ""Witch hunt."" ""I think it's ridiculous, it's a witch hunt. I'm leading in the polls. They have no idea how they stop me, the only way they can try is through impeachment. This has never happened to a president before,"" Trump claimed. He was again unclear on whether a transcript of the call would be released -- and when. ""It's nonsense and when you see the call, when you see the readout of the call, which I assume you'll see at some point, you'll understand. That call was perfect, it couldn't have been nicer,"" Trump said. A readout was released shortly after the call took place. He also again went after Biden without offering specifics or evidence. ""Even the Ukrainian government put out a statement that that was a perfect call, there was no pressure put on them whatsoever. But there was pressure put on with respect to Joe Biden. What Joe Biden did for his son, that's something they should be looking at,"" Trump said."
"""I believe that the whistleblower and the inspector general have acted in good faith throughout. I have every reason to believe that they have done everything by the book and followed the law,"" said acting Director of National Intelligence  Joseph Maguire , testifying before a key House committee. But Maguire declined to say whether he spoke to the President about the whistleblower complaint that alleged that Trump  solicited the help of Ukraine  to interfere in the 2020 election and that White House officials tried to hide his conduct, in the latest twist of a fast-escalating drama that has turned into the most serious crisis of Trump's presidency. ""I am not partisan and I am not political,"" said Maguire, a former Navy SEAL commander who served eight presidents in uniform and was not a well-known public figure until he was thrust into the glare of the scandal. Democrats used the high profile forum to accuse the President of abusing his power and endangering national security. Republicans tried to pick holes in the complaint, noting that the unidentified whistleblower admitted not having first-hand knowledge of events including Trump's call with Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky . Under intense pressure from Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, Maguire also acknowledged that his office consulted with the White House counsel's office after receiving a  complaint detailing allegations about Trump's communications with Ukraine , because calls with foreign leaders usually fall under executive privilege. Maguire had been accused before the hearing of caving into White House pressure not to follow the law and turn over a complaint that the intelligence community's inspector general deemed ""urgent and credible."" The acting DNI repeatedly defended his handling of the complaint, telling lawmakers he followed the law in an ""unprecedented"" situation, despite claims to the contrary by Democrats that he infringed on their right to review the allegations. His appearance before the committee and a closed door briefing before the Senate panel, came a day after lawmakers had their first chance to see the classified account that spurred Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. The account was declassified and  released Thursday morning.  Allegations of a 'coverup' The complaint states that several White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by Trump's July 25 phone call with  Zelensky  and tried to ""lock down"" all records of the phone call, especially the word-for-word transcript produced by the White House. Maguire said during his testimony he did not have the authority to waive the executive privilege that covered the conversation with Ukraine's President and would not say whether he discussed the complaint with Trump.  ""My conversations with the President, because I'm the director of national intelligence, are privileged, and it would be inappropriate for me, because it would destroy my relationship with the President in intelligence matters, to divulge any of my conversations with the President of the United States,"" Maguire said responding to a question from Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat.  But in a tense exchange with Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, Maguire conceded that ""there is an allegation of a coverup."" ""But right now, all we have is an allegation — an allegation with second hand information from a whistleblower. I have no knowledge on whether or not that is true and accurate statement,"" he said. When asked later in the hearing if Trump asked him to disclose the identity of the whistleblower, Maguire told lawmakers,"" I can tell you emphatically, no."" He also said no one else within the White House or DOJ asked him to identify the whistleblower. White House consulted after complaint  Initially, Maguire seemed to waver about the chronology of events related to  his handling of the complaint  but ultimately told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee that his office did seek guidance from the White House before raising the issue with the Office of Legal Counsel and Department of Justice, which advised he was not legally bound to provide it to the committee.  ""Such calls are typically subject to executive privilege, as a result we consulted with the White House counsel's office and were advised that much of the information of the complaint was in fact subject to executive privilege,"" Maguire said. ""A privilege that I do not have the authority to waive. Because of that we were unable to immediately share the details of the complaint with this committee."" The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has provided a redacted version to Congress that members can bring to an open hearing, a spokesperson said. The anticipation ahead of Maguire's testimony was also amplified by the White House's decision to  release a transcript of Trump's July 25 phone call  with the leader of Ukraine that shows the President repeatedly pressed his counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. The conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is included in the whistleblower complaint, a source familiar with the situation said last week, a revelation that only raised more questions in the ongoing controversy. On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the President had betrayed his oath of office and announced  she is opening a formal impeachment inquiry , a move that has raised the stakes of this week's events. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, started the hearing by accusing Trump of betraying his oath of office and compromising US national security for Trump's ""personal, political benefit,"" referring to the conduct outlined in the call transcript released Wednesday.   ""It forces us to confront the remedy the founders provided for such a flagrant abuse of office: impeachment. Now this matter would not have come to the attention of our committee or the nation's attention without the courage of a single person- the whistleblower,"" he said.  GOP members question whistleblower's claim Republicans, however, keyed in to the fact that the whistleblower acknowledged they did not have firsthand knowledge of most of the events described in the complaint.  ""I was not a direct witness to most of the events described,"" the whistleblower wrote, noting that they were aware of details in the complaint pertaining to Trump's July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian President because of ""White House officials with direct knowledge of the call."" But the public now has a way to test the accuracy of at least part of the whistleblower's complaint by comparing the details related to that call to the transcript released by the White House Wednesday. By all appearances, the information is consistent. In his testimony Thursday, Maguire continued to defend his handling of the  whistleblower complaint , saying he was told by the Department of Justice it did ""not meet the statutory requirement of 'urgent concern,'"" required to transmit to Congress and insisted that decision was ""binding.""  ""After reviewing the complaint, and the inspector general's transmittal letter, the office of legal counsel determined that the complaint's allegations do not meet the statutory requirement definition (of) legal, urgent concern, and found that I was not legally required to transmit the material to our oversight committee,"" he added. Last week, Maguire refused to comply with a deadline to hand over a whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee that had been deemed by the intelligence community inspector general to be ""credible and urgent,"" a conclusion that drove his push to provide Congress with the details and refer the matter to the Justice Department for consideration of criminality. Maguire suggested during his testimony that he understood the importance of the complaint itself.  ""I realized ... full and well the importance of the allegation,"" Maguire said, adding later, ""when I saw that, I anticipated having to sit in front of some committee some time to discuss it."" This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday."

Sign up  here . ** On the roster: Biden hits the skids in new Q Poll - Trump leaned on Ukrainian leader for Biden dirt - Audible: Excuses, excuses! - Happy hump day 
BIDEN HITS THE SKIDS IN NEW Q POLL Politico:  “A new national survey shows  Elizabeth Warren  now sitting atop the 2020 Democratic field… Twenty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents polled by Quinnipiac University said they favor Warren, according to a poll released Wednesday morning. Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President  Joe Biden . Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support. The latest survey reinforces other public polling showing Warren and Biden separating from their fellow contenders in the Democratic presidential race. Vermont Sen.  Bernie Sanders  ranked third in Tuesday’s poll, achieving 16 percent support, followed by Mayor  Pete Buttigieg  of South Bend, Ind., with 7 percent, and California Sen.  Kamala Harris  at 3 percent.” Trump attacks raise doubts about Biden for Dem voters -   NYT : “In public, for the last five days, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his campaign have been on a ferocious offensive, ripping into  President Trump  for allegedly abusing his powers in asking Ukraine’s leader to help hurt Mr. Biden politically, and castigating the news media for questioning his son  Hunter Biden ’s financial dealings there. … In private, though, this has been an enraging and uncertain time for the Biden campaign, and for Mr. Biden himself… He and his advisers have long feared that Hunter Biden would become a target for political opponent…And as Mr. Trump’s onslaught has pushed the House of Representatives to start an impeachment inquiry, Mr. Biden now faces a crucial political test where his standing may hinge on how he handles a wildly unpredictable confrontation with Mr. Trump.” Warren ready for air war with $10 million buy -  Politico:  “ Elizabeth Warren ’s presidential campaign on Tuesday announced an early-state ad campaign of at least $10 million, suggesting that the Massachusetts senator is continuing to raise big money from grass-roots donors after an anemic start. The campaign told POLITICO that a digital ad campaign would begin immediately and that they are currently reserving television time, with the entire buy ramping up over the next few months. The campaign declined to say when its spending on digital and TV ads would reach eight figures. ‘Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,’ campaign manager  Roger Lau  wrote in a memo emailed to supporters Tuesday morning. The campaign ‘will be more digital than old-school broadcast television.’ The campaign also released three ads Tuesday — 15-second, 30-second, and 1-minute spots — which highlight Warren’s policy plans and her intention to crack down on corruption in government.” Buttigieg hitches a ride on McCain’s media strategy -  CBS News:  “The South Bend, Indiana mayor rolled across Iowa on a four-day bus tour and allowed everything uttered on the bus to be on the record, drawing ready comparisons to the late Senator  John McCain 's ‘Straight Talk Express,’ the bus he toured the country in when he ran for president in 2000. The coach, which has also been around the country in the service of former President  Barack Obama ,  Justin Timberlake  and  Tom Hanks , is now styled with Buttigieg signs, marble floors and plays news channels or football in the background. … He and his campaign have ramped up spending in Iowa in the past month, releasing a new TV ad on Monday, hiring more staff on the ground and opening offices. He added that the strategy is not to ‘go around Iowa.’” Sanders touts dozen of union member endorsements -  The Hill:  “White House hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled the endorsements of 85 union members in Iowa as he works to shore up support for his progressive bona fides against a surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The endorsements were announced on the ‘Bernie beats Trump’ tour in Iowa during which Sanders is visiting counties that voted for former President Obama in 2008 and 2012 and for President Trump in 2016 to help ensure skeptical voters that he can beat Trump in a general election. … The endorsements come from members of several unions, including the autoworkers of America and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.” THE RULEBOOK: OYEZ, OYEZ 
“The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution.” –  Alexander Hamilton ,  Federalist No. 78 TIME OUT: WELL PACKAGED PEANUTS   New Yorker:  “Timing is the life force of comics. Without a sensitivity to the rhythms and the music—a.k.a. the reality—of life, a comic strip will arrive D.O.A., nothing more than a bunch of dumb pictures. … The reader doesn’t just look at  Charlie Brown ,  Linus ,  Lucy , and  Snoopy  but reads them as musical notes in a silently heard composition of hilarity, cruelty, and occasional melancholy. In 1950, the comics page was a more or less settled territory into which very few new features could be shoehorned, and, from the get-go, ‘Peanuts’ was marketed as a space-saver.

TRUMP LEANED ON UKRAINIAN LEADER FOR BIDEN DIRT WSJ : “ President Trump  asked his Ukrainian counterpart,  Volodymyr Zelensky , to ‘look into’ former Vice President  Joe Biden ’s son and said he would direct his personal lawyer and attorney general to reach out to Mr. Zelensky to ‘get to the bottom of it,’ according to a document released by the White House designed to memorialize a July phone call between the leaders. The document also revealed that Mr. Trump, before asking Ukraine to examine actions by Mr. Biden’s son, reminded Mr. Zelensky that the U.S. sends security aid to Ukraine. ‘I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,’ he said. ‘We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.’ He contrasted the U.S. aid with what European countries do to help Ukraine. According to the document released by the White House on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump didn’t make an explicit link on the call between the U.S. aid—which he had ordered a hold on a week earlier—and an investigation into Mr. Biden’s son.” Trump lawyer: State Department directed involvement -   WashEx : “President Trump's personal lawyer  Rudy Giuliani  said he began dealing with Ukrainian officials at the behest of the State Department. During an interview Tuesday evening on Fox News, Giuliani was prompted to respond to a Washington Post report in which White House insiders complained about how he was improperly ‘injecting himself’ into U.S.-Ukraine relations. ‘Man, I really did,’ Giuliani said sarcastically. ‘And you know who I did at the request of? The State Department. I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it.’ Holding up his mobile phone, Giuliani said he reported every conversation he had to the Trump administration and that evidence of this communications with the State Department were all on the device.” Pelosi heats up impeachment rhetoric, but not her go-slow approach -  Roll Call : “Speaker  Nancy Pelosi ’s announcement Tuesday that the House is in an ‘official impeachment inquiry’ gave no hints of how or whether it would accelerate any Democratic effort to remove President Donald Trump from office. Pelosi said she directed the six House committees conducting oversight of the Trump administration to move forward ‘under that umbrella’ of an impeachment inquiry — but gave no details about how the day-to-day approach would differ. In that way, Pelosi appeared to stay on a measured Democratic approach that for months has fallen short of raising public support for impeachment — particularly with the Trump administration’s unyielding rejection of congressional subpoena power — and put off potentially stronger moves toward impeachment.” Poll shows reason for her caution -  WaPo:  “Amid a groundswell of support for impeachment proceedings among House Democrats, a new poll finds a majority of Americans do not favor ousting President Trump from office. Thirty-seven percent of voters say that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 57 percent say he should not be impeached, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning. … The poll shows a stark partisan divide on the question of impeachment. Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.” Silver: Will Dems learn lessons of Russia probe? -    FiveThirtyEight : “Despite Trump being quite unpopular, and despite the public largely buying Democrats’ interpretation of the fact pattern on Russia — most polls find that a majority of the public thinks that Trump sought to obstruct the investigation into Russia, for instance — impeachment was a soundly unpopular proposition. … The politics of impeachment on Ukraine may be different than on Russia. But Democrats should take public opinion seriously. That doesn’t mean you always have to do the poll-driven thing. But don’t wish the numbers away because you don’t like them, or presume that they’ll change in your favor, or assume there won’t be consequences for taking an unpopular action. More specifically for Democrats, their failure to persuade the public that Russia warranted impeachment offers several potential lessons if they are to proceed on Ukraine.” PLAY-BY-PLAY Trump reelection campaign, RNC using impeachment for fundraising haul  -  Politico AUDIBLE: EXCUSES, EXCUSES!

“I just have a political science question regarding the 2020 Senate race in Kansas.  Kris Kobach  lost the governor’s race in 2018 and is now running for the GOP nomination for Senate (yinz know this already). I was wondering do voters’ think differently when selecting a governor rather than a Senator? Kobach was too right-wing for the Topeka state House as an executive, but as a legislator in Washington? Does it make a difference that electing a Democratic Governor is vastly different than a Democratic Senator with vastly different consequences politically? Hopefully my question makes sense.” –  James Belany , Pittsburgh 
[ Ed. note: The first thing to remember, Mr. Belany, is that there’s precious little science in politics. Like many of the humanities, political theory and the study of campaigns and elections, got squeezed into a faux “science” during the middle of the last century. To that I say: Phooey! The science at play in your question could be social psychology, though. Would the voters of Kansas feel differently about a radical senator than they would a radical governor? Maybe there’s something to that. But maybe there’s another discipline to consider: Mathematics. There were three candidates for governor in 2018, but maybe only two for Senate in 2020. Could Kobach slide by in a binary election especially when Republican voters are storming the polls in a presidential year? Maybe. But that doesn’t change the fact that the GOP would much rather not have to deal with Kobach. Not only does he increase the degree of difficulty in Kansas, but Democrats running in other states can use his comments and record against his fellow Republicans. ]

"Despite major holes in The New York Times story, members of 'The Squad' are calling for Brett Kavanaugh's impeachment and other top Democrats are attacking the FBI's investigation into the allegations; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' The latest smear on Supreme Court Justice  Brett Kavanaugh  is a disaster for Democrats, and everyone seems to know it except the party's presidential candidates. No sooner had The New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, then most of the candidates demanded Kavanaugh's  impeachment . ""These newest revelations are disturbing,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter, adding ""Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."" RUSH LIMBAUGH: TREATMENT OF TRUMP BY DEMOCRATS, MEDIA HAS AMERICANS 'QUIETLY SEETHING' Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Kavanaugh's ""place on the court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached."" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Obama housing secretary Julián Castro and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke joined in with impeachment calls of their own. Even former Vice President Joe Biden demanded Congress open an investigation and ""follow the evidence to wherever it leads."" That was considered the restrained response in the Democratic field. Never mind that the supposed victim has told friends she has no recollection of the alleged incident; facts have never stood in the Democrats' way when it comes to Kavanaugh before. If the Democratic presidential contenders want to see  Kavanaugh  impeached, I say go for it. Open the investigation Biden has demanded. Start impeachment hearings. And broadcast it for all of America to see. Let's remind voters of the disgraceful confirmation process Kavanaugh faced. Let's relive how Democrats accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, exposing himself to a college classmate and participating in gang rapes at high school parties -- all without a shred of corroborating evidence. Let's rehash Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, but this time with the knowledge that the principal witness Ford named to her alleged assault, Leland Keyser, is now on record saying she does not believe Ford. Let's remind Americans how Senate Democrats denied Kavanaugh the presumption of innocence and insisted that the burden was on him to prove he was not a sexual predator. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER That sure worked out well for Democrats last time around. In 2018, the Kavanaugh debacle may have cost Democrats control of the Senate. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D.-Mo., lost their seats thanks to voters disgusted by their party's campaign of character assassination against Kavanaugh, while Democrats blew a chance to pick up GOP seats in Tennessee and Texas. As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at the time, the Kavanaugh hearings were ""like an adrenaline shot"" for the Republican base. Now, Democrats want to bring out the hypodermic needle for the 2020 elections. Sounds good to me. On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders know this a path to disaster. In a stunning rebuke of the party's presidential contenders, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told those calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment to ""get real."" ""We've got to get beyond this 'impeachment is the answer to every problem,'"" Durbin said. ""It's become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you're unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. ... If that's how we are identified ... we run the risk that people will feel we're ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was even more succinct. Asked if the House was going to investigate the new allegation, she said ""no."" Durbin and Pelosi understand that the threats to impeach Kavanaugh are a godsend for Trump. And they come in the wake of Senate Democrats issuing an unprecedented threat to the other Supreme Court justices. In a brief, they warned that if the high court does not rule as Democrats wish in a gun case, they could ""restructure"" the court when they take power in the 2020 elections -- packing it with liberal justices, flipping a 5-to-4 conservative majority to a liberal majority. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats do not seem to realize that when they make threats like these, they are not hurting Kavanaugh or Trump, they are hurting themselves. In 2016, 26 percent of Trump voters said Supreme Court nominees were the most important issue to them, while only 18 percent of Hillary Clinton's voters mirrored the sentiment. As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose. In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Kavanaugh or liberal court-packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should. So, let the impeachment proceedings begin. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MARC THIESSEN"
"Yes, Warren tops the field in the  CNN-DMR poll  with 22% support, followed by former Vice President Joe Biden at 20% (the poll has a four-point margin of error, putting the two essentially in a tie). Warren and Biden are followed distantly by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 11%.  But that doesn't tell the whole story: The topline numbers are actually the least good thing for Warren in the poll.  Consider this: * Warren gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now. * Her favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is behind her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders. * Warren is the first or second choice of 42% of those polled. That's well in front of Biden (30% first/second combined), Sanders (21%), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (18%) and California Sen. Kamala Harris (16%). Any one of those three data points would suggest that this poll may have only caught the start of Warren's rise in Iowa. All three together suggest she is well positioned to take off like a rocket ship in the state. Not only does she already have a broad-base of support in the state (as evidence by the topline numbers) but she also has significant passion among those who are for her and remains well-liked -- and a possible voting option -- for those who say she is their second choice at the moment. That's not even taking into account Warren's grassroots operation, which is widely regarded as the best -- by a lot -- of any campaign in Iowa.  Wrote the Des Moines Register on  Sunday: ""Elizabeth Warren's slow but steady rise in the first-in-the-nation caucus state is as much a result of her robust organizational presence here as it is a response to the Massachusetts senator's many plans and policies, Iowa experts say ... the (poll) results were not surprising, said several Iowa Democrats who have watched Warren build out a team that is widely credited with having the most sophisticated organizational presence in the state."" Add it all up and you get this: With 133 days left before the February 3 caucuses, Warren is the clear Iowa front-runner. There's simply no one else who can make anywhere near as strong a case -- either by polling or staff or both -- as Warren in the state. Now, OF COURSE, 133 days is a long time in politics. Things can change. If past is prologue, there will be a handful of up and downs within the top tier between now and February 3. But it's very clear from the polling trends that Iowa is now Warren's to lose.  If she does win it, then Warren would be in a great position heading into  New Hampshire, where she is running just behind both Biden and Sanders  at the moment. And if Warren wins both of the first two voting states, the field of remaining challengers is going to shrink. Rapidly."
"Former Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign chief strategist Mark Penn reacts to the latest numbers. Former Vice President  Joe Biden’s  many gaffes don’t mean he’s mentally unfit to be president, but if they raise enough questions with voters they might prevent him from getting the Democratic presidential nomination, or from getting elected if he becomes the nominee. Biden, his two leading competitors in the Democratic presidential primaries and  President Trump  are all in their 70s. The oldest is Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 78, followed by Biden at 76, Trump at 73, and Sen. Elizabeth of Warren of Massachusetts at 70. Are all four too old for what is probably one of the most intellectually challenging jobs in the world, with enormous power over our lives and the future of the planet? FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN AT NEW LOW IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE Biden, Sanders, Warren and Trump all keep demanding and high-pressure schedules, traveling frequently, often getting little sleep, and speaking on an almost daily basis in front of TV cameras to answer questions from reporters and to address audiences large and small. That takes stamina and a quick mind. But because they speak in public so often and most of what they say is recorded, each of them sometimes generates news stories when saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. Biden, however, seems to exceed the average for the number of these gaffes. And because the former vice president’s frequent gaffes have now become an issue raising questions about his fitness to serve as president, they are getting outsized attention in the media and from his opponents. Still, at this early stage in the 2020 presidential race Biden remains the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. A  Fox News poll  that came out this week shows Biden has the support of 29 percent of likely Democratic primary voters, compared with 18 percent for Sanders and 16 percent for Warren. However, Biden’s solid lead was down by two points since August and six points since May. Biden has almost universal name recognition among voters from his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president and 36 years in the Senate before that. A centrist who doesn’t embrace the more far-left policies of Sanders and Warren, Biden has strong appeal for many voters because of his more moderate positions and because they believe he can make Trump a one-term president. But what about all the Biden gaffes? His critics are raising questions about his mental fitness and whether he could be suffering from the early stages of dementia that could grow markedly worse at the end of a potential two terms in the White House. So far the Democratic presidential candidate going after Trump most directly on the mental fitness issue is former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, who aggressively attacked Biden in the last presidential debate, accusing Biden of forgetting a comment he had made just minutes earlier. But it turns out that Castro was the one who forgot what Biden said. Does the fact that Castro got mixed up mean he is suffering from dementia? Look, dementia isn’t diagnosed by watching someone on a podium at a televised debate, where candidates are required to instantly respond to questions and sum up complex issues in a minute or less. And once in office, presidents have advisers and briefings and time to learn and think about issues. No one is ever going to say to a president: Sir (or someday Madam), tell me in 60 seconds how to end terrorism, or end poverty, or improve our educational system, or balance the federal budget. And when we look at Biden’s gaffes and question if he is possibly “losing it” or if he’s fit for office, we shouldn’t forget that President Trump certainly has made quite a few gaffes of his own. More importantly, according to The Washington Post’s  Fact Checker database , as of Aug. 5 Trump “had made 12,019 false or misleading claims.” “President Trump’s proclivity for spouting exaggerated numbers, unwarranted boasts and outright falsehoods has continued at a remarkable pace,” a Post article reported. Of course, the president and his supporters strongly dispute the Post tally, and the president regularly denounces the newspaper as biased against him and as purveying “fake news.” But if voters are concerned about instances where Biden gets a bit confused at times and inadvertently says the wrong thing, they should be even more concerned about Trump’s “false and misleading claims.” We all accidentally say the wrong thing sometimes and forget things or remember past events incorrectly. Those are innocent mistakes. And we all age differently. Some people are past their peak mental performance in their 60s and some even have dementia at that age. Others are just fine mentally in their 80s and even beyond. Space doesn’t permit a listing of all Biden’s gaffes, simply because there are so many. But importantly, he’s been making these gaffes for decades, going back to when he was a young man and in middle age. That hasn’t prevented him from devoting a lifetime to public service and accomplishing a great deal for the American people. But let’s look at just a few of Biden’s gaffes. Recently Biden has urged parents to keep “record players” on to improve the vocabulary of their children. He said he was in Vermont when he was really in New Hampshire. Biden said in August that he was still vice president at the time of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb.14, 2018 – when he had been out of office for more than a year.  An official with Biden’s campaign later said Biden had meant to refer to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, which occurred in December 2012. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER And one of Biden’s gaffes, which was a favorite for many and quite funny, came during CNN’s July 31 presidential debate, when he asked voters to “go to Joe 30330.” He said later he meant to say “text.” “I was so focused on making the case for Joe, I said ‘Joe’ and I gave the number,” he said. According to the Alzheimer’s Association: “There is no one test to determine if someone has dementia.  Doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia based on a careful medical history, a physical examination, laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day function and behavior associated with each type.” I’m not a doctor and I certainly can’t diagnose Biden’s mental abilities. But you would think if he really was slipping mentally his own doctors, his wife, other family members and the people who work with him every day would notice something was seriously wrong. And you would think Biden himself would notice and conclude for his own health and for the good of the country he deeply loves that he should withdraw from the presidential race – or resign from the presidency, should he become president and be stricken with dementia. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The bottom line is that opponents attack each other in campaigns. This has begun happening in the 2020 presidential race and is going to get a lot worse. As the Democratic front-runner, Biden is a magnet for attacks – as always happens with front-runners. My best advice to Biden is to focus on trying to reduce the number of gaffes he makes, working with his top advisers. He has an outstanding record in government and shouldn’t be pushed out of the race for slips of the tongue, as long as they don’t indicate he has more serious problems that make him unfit to be our next president.

"President Trump speaks at press conference at the Intercontinental Hotel in New York City. A defiant  President Trump  said during a press conference in New York Wednesday that he wants ""full transparency"" not only over the ""so-called whistleblower""  allegations  leveled against him, but also ""from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China."" Trump additionally demanded ""transparency from Democrats who went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new president ... to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat. They threatened him if he didn't do things -- now that's what they're accusing me of, but I didn't do it."" The aggressive move signaled that the White House would seek to turn the tables against Democrats who have initiated an  impeachment inquiry , following the  whistleblower's complaint  that Trump had improperly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden. Zelensky, speaking across from Trump just an hour earlier, told reporters  he did not feel ""pushed""  at all in his conversations with the president. WATCH: UKRAINE PRESIDENT BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS HE WASN'T PRESSURED Earlier in the day, the White House  released a transcript  of Trump's July call with Zelensky, showing Trump sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country. But the transcript also did not demonstrate that Trump leveraged military aid to Ukraine to obtain a ""promise"" on a Biden investigation, as a widely cited  report in The Washington Post  had claimed. At the press conference, Trump specifically called attention to a little-discussed CNN  report  from May, which described how Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez, Dick Durbin, and Patrick Leahy pushed Ukraine’s top prosecutor not to close four investigations perceived as critical to then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe -- and, by Democrats' current logic, seemingly implied that their support for U.S. aid to Ukraine was at stake. ""The Democrats have done what they're accusing me of doing,"" Trump said. The Democratic senators wrote  in a  letter  to Ukraine's leader at the time: ""In four short years, Ukraine has made significant progress in building [democratic] institutions despite ongoing military, economic, and political pressure from Moscow. We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump."" The senators called for the top prosecutor to “reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.” The Post's Marc Thiessen  initially flagged the letter  on Tuesday, calling it evidence of a ""double standard"" among Democrats. READ IT: THIESSEN CALLS OUT DEMS' DOUBLE STANDARD ""Senator Chris Murphy literally threatened the president of Ukraine that if he doesn't do things right, they won't have Democrat support in Congress,"" Trump added. That was a reference to the  Connecticut Democrat's comments  at a bipartisan meeting in Kiev earlier this month, when Murphy called U.S. aid the “most important asset” of Ukraine -- then issued a warning. ""I told Zelensky that he should not insert himself or his government into American politics,"" Murphy said, according to The Hill. ""I cautioned him that complying with the demands of the President's campaign representatives to investigate a political rival of the President would gravely damage the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. There are few things that Republicans and Democrats agree on in Washington these days, and support for Ukraine is one of them."" READ THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE TRUMP PHONE CALL Responding to Trump's statements, Murphy said that ""in the meeting Republican Senator Ron Johnson and I had with President Zelensky three weeks ago, I made it clear to him that Ukraine should not become involved in the 2020 election and that his government should communicate with the State Department, not the president's campaign. I still believe this to be true."" But in colorful language, Trump told reporters that the evidence clearly showed Democrats were disingenuously attacking him for political gain. ""We have the greatest economy we've ever had,"" The president said. ""When you see little [House Intelligence Committee Chair] Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mic, smart guy by the way. ... Then he goes into a room with [House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry] Nadler, and they must laugh their asses off."" ""They must laugh their asses off."" Not all Democrats in the House have been on board with impeachment. 2020 presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, said Wednesday that the Ukraine transcript  did not present a ""compelling"" reason  to impeach the president. Taking the fight to the Democrats over the scores of Democrats who do support an impeachment inquiry could pay dividends for Republicans ahead of next year's elections. The National Republican Congressional Committee indicated Wednesday that its fundraising was up 608 percent after Democrats' impeachment push. And the Trump reelection campaign and GOP announced they had raised a combined $5 million in just 24 hours. Trump, accompanied by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, also slammed the media for focusing so heavily on a whistleblower's allegation that he improperly pressured Zelensky for political reasons. WATCH: PELOSI ADMITS SHE HASN'T READ THE UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT ""We've made some fantastic deals, like with Japan, for farmers -- and that doesn't get covered, because you waste your time on nonsense,"" Trump said. ""It's very sad what Democrats are doing to this country -- they're dividing, they're demeaning."" Pompeo and Mnuchin each discussed progress on trade, including the ongoing trade war with China, as well as Iran policy. Trump's comments came shortly after he wrapped up a  joint media  appearance with Zelensky -- who flatly  told reporters  that he did not feel ""pushed"" to investigate Joe Biden. “We had a great phone call,” Zelensky said earlier, as he sat across from Trump. “It was normal.” Zelensky's comments did little to quiet a growing call among Democrats to press ahead with the  impeachment inquiry  announced Tuesday by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Also on Wednesday, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire flatly contradicted  another report in the Post , and maintained he never considered resigning over the matter. ""The Amazon Washington Post put out a fake article that [Maguire] was going to quit, blaming the White House for something they wouldn't let him talk openly about -- and I was shocked,"" Trump said at the presser. The transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky, declassified by Trump a day earlier, indicates that the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25 from 9:03 a.m. to 9:33 a.m. The document begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory, before asking for a “favor” in the form of Ukraine providing information about the hacking of a Democratic National Committee (DNC) server in 2016 as part of apparent election interference efforts. UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT SHOWS NO EXPLICIT QUID PRO QUO Trump referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks. Separately, the transcript shows, the president then pushed for a closer look at Biden's own dealings in Ukraine. Joe Biden  has acknowledged   on camera  that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm  Burisma Holdings  — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption. Meanwhile, political scientist Ian Bremmer said the real scandal wasn't Biden's pressure to get rid of Shokin, but Hunter Biden's lucrative business work in Ukraine. Hunter Biden took a key position at Burisma shortly after Joe Biden visited Ukraine in 2014 and pushed officials there to greatly increase natural gas production. Hunter made tens of thousands of dollars a month but had no relevant credentials. ""Impossible to justify $50k/month for Hunter Biden serving on a Ukrainian energy board w zero expertise unless he promised to sell access,"" Bremmer wrote. ""That’s a problem for the Vice President, but completely unrelated to Biden urging Ukraine President to fire his Special Prosecutor,"" Bremmer continued. ""[The prosecutor] was corrupt, refused to investigate anyone, and who Dems and GOP agreed needed to go."" Trump said in the phone call with the Zelensky that he was focused primarily on the circumstances surrounding Shokin's termination. “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call with the Zelensky. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.” BIDEN UKRAINE DEALINGS: 7 ESSENTIAL FACTS At the presser, Trump broadened the scope of his concerns to the Biden's business dealings generally, and said that he was reluctant to release the transcript because he was concerned about setting the ""precedent"" of releasing private calls with foreign leaders to ""the fake news media."" Previous impeachment inquiries were triggered by actual felony violations or allegations of egregious abuse of power, says Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy, former assistant U.S. attorney. ""But you folks were saying such lies about a call that was so innocent and so nice,"" Trump said, that he felt compelled to act. On Wednesday, just prior to his press conference, Trump tweeted that he had told Republicans he supported a closer look into the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine. ""I have informed  @GOPLeader   Kevin McCarthy and all Republicans in the House that I fully support transparency on so-called whistleblower information but also insist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son Hunter, on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China,"" Trump wrote. ""Additionally, I demand transparency from Democrats that went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new President to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat,"" he added. Bipartisan efforts  are underway for the whistleblower to testify before Congress. The Justice Department – in a new letter from the Office of Legal Counsel obtained by Fox News –pushed back Wednesday on the claim that the whistleblower brought out something of “urgent concern” that would have to be turned over to Congress. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The letter also said the intelligence community inspector general found “some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,” but still said the allegations “appeared credible.” Fox News previously reported that, according to a source, the individual also did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the phone call. Sources, meanwhile, said the original allegations spoke to a possible campaign finance violation, but the DOJ concluded that Trump’s request for an investigation did not qualify as a “thing of value” for his campaign – and therefore did not constitute a criminal violation. Fox News’ Alex Pappas, Ed Henry, Jake Gibson, Catherine Herridge, Kevin Corke and Brooke Singman contributed to this report."

A whistleblower inside the intelligence community filed a complaint about communications between President Trump and a foreign leader. The whistleblower was alarmed by a ""promise"" Trump allegedly made to the foreign leader. The Democratically led House Intelligence Committee wants to see the complaint, but Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence, has blocked that. (He's set to testify before the committee next week.) The White House and Justice Department told the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  not to share the complaint  because they don't believe it's governed by laws covering intelligence whistleblowers, three sources told CNN. Then, yesterday the  Washington Post  and  New York Times  reported that the communications at the center of all this involved Ukraine. Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by phone in July. Some Trump supporters have  pushed for the Ukrainian government to open investigations  that the President could use to raise suspicions about his political rivals, including Joe Biden. Some observers wonder if there's a connection between the push for an investigation and Trump's call with Zelensky. But there's no public evidence that the whistleblower's complaint pertains to the Trump-Zelensky call. The potential ramifications of this story are starting to become more clear, CNN political analyst Stephen Collinson says, and the  risks facing the President, the intelligence community and Democrats  in Congress are climbing by the day.  Here are 5 key questions  about the whistleblower case. 2. Justin Trudeau Another day, another apology from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. After a  third incident emerged  of him  wearing brownface or blackface , he was forced to meet with reporters for the second day in a row to say he's sorry for wearing racist makeup. He also flat out said he doesn't remember how many times he's worn blackface. Trudeau, known for his uber-progressive views, insists he's still an ally in the fight for social justice. But this scandal  and other recent political hiccups  could mix to seriously threaten his chances at re-election next month. 3. Israel It's been three days since votes were cast in Israel's elections, and we  still don't know who will be leading the country . Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White party, declared victory because his party is projected to win a few more seats in Israel's legislature than Likud, the political party headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But Gantz won't have enough seats to govern. He'd probably have to form a coalition with Netanyahu to do that, and that's probably not going to happen. So, that brings up another possibility: Israel may have to have a third election to settle the political gridlock. 4. Weather The remnants of Tropical Storm Imelda are  pushing into northern Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana  today, dumping heavy rain along the way. The storm left quite the mess in southeast Texas, where some areas got more than 30 inches of rain. Flooding was so bad in Houston that  hundreds of cars were abandoned  after rising water made some roads impassable. Meanwhile, out in the Atlantic,  Hurricane Jerry has developed . It's a Category 1 storm right now and is expected to pass just north of the Leeward Islands today before moving north of Puerto Rico and the Bahamas over the weekend. 5. Climate strike If your co-worker or classmate isn't around today, it may not be because they're getting an early jump on the weekend. They could be on strike. Global climate strikes are taking place today all over the world, with people walking out of workplaces and classrooms  to demand action to address the climate crisis . It's expected to be the biggest day of climate demonstrations in history. More than  100,000 people gathered in Melbourne , Australia. Some  workers from Amazon  and Microsoft are walking off the job. Some  companies are actually supporting  their employees' participation in the strike.

"""Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a US election, it couldn't be clearer,"" Weld said in an interview on  MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""  ""And that's not just undermining democratic institutions, that is treason. It's treason pure and simple.""  ""The penalty for treason under the US code is death. That's the only penalty,"" Weld added. ""The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the President if he could work out a plea deal."" Weld's comments come amid mounting scrutiny of Trump after he  acknowledged  discussing Biden and his son, Hunter, in a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The call was part of a  whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. White House officials are  now considering  releasing a transcript of the call, multiple sources have told CNN. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Article Three of the Constitution defines treason as ""levying War against [the US] or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort."" The president, the Constitution says, ""shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" US code states individuals found guilty of treason ""shall suffer death"" or face imprisonment, a fine, and ""shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States."" Weld made the comments in a joint interview alongside two other Republicans challenging Trump for the GOP nomination, former congressmen Joe Walsh and Mark Sanford. ""Donald Trump needs to be impeached. Period,"" Walsh said. ""As Bill Weld just said, he told a foreign leader two months ago to interfere in our 2020 election. He needs to be impeached."" Sanford, who also served as governor of South Carolina, echoed Weld and Walsh's strong rhetoric. ""I think you know where the three of us are on this larger debate,"" he said. Earlier this month, all three GOP challengers penned an  op-ed in The Washington Post  lambasting state Republican leaders and Trump for opting to cancel their 2020 presidential primary elections in a show of support for the President. ""The primary nomination process is the only opportunity for Republicans to have a voice in deciding who will represent our party,"" they said. ""Let those voices be heard."" The canceled primaries underscore the difficulty the long-shot candidates will have in challenging Trump, who, according to a CNN/SSRS Poll this month, has an  88% approval rating among Republicans."
"President Trump to release complete transcript of phone call with Ukrainian president; Rep. Eric Swalwell reacts. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. , accused  President Trump  of ""betrayal"" Tuesday after  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  formally announced an  impeachment inquiry  over the commander-in-chief's interactions with Ukraine's president. ""When you ask a foreign government for help you owe them something which means one day you may have to put another country's interests ahead of America's interests, which to me is betrayal,"" Swalwell said on "" The Story with Martha MacCallum ."" Trump allegedly pushed  Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky  to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Biden has acknowledged that while he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption. TRUMP VOWS TO RELEASE TRANSCRIPT OF CALL WITH UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT Sources told Fox News that Trump personally ordered White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he allegedly discussed the potential investigation of the Bidens with Zelensky. When MacCallum asked Swalwell about the importance of the intelligence community whistleblower report, the congressman said it was not needed for an investigation and described it as ""color."" ""We already have the president's admission... he's copped to the crime. So we don't really need the whistleblower report,"" Swalwell said. ""I think it will add color to the investigation."" Swalwell also said Trump's alleged comments during the phone call was enough for impeachment. ""But again, if that had never happened -- if he had never worked with the Russians or embraced their help or obstructed justice or took money from foreign nationals, this act alone would be impeachable, ""Swalwell said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The congressman also believes direct ""quid pro quo"" statements are not needed, that the president's own words are enough to impeach. ""When you listen to the president's own words, by asking the Ukrainians to do this when you ask somebody to do something you owe them something in the future... that's enough,"" Swalwell said.

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV,  sign up for our Watching newsletter  and get recommendations straight to your inbox. ‘He Pays More Attention to Biden’s Kid’ On Sunday, President Trump acknowledged that he had spoken about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son Hunter  in a July phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine . News outlets have reported that this call was part of a whistle-blower’s complaint against Trump and that the president asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son before the 2020 election. Credit Credit Video by Late Night With Seth Meyers “He brought it up eight times on one phone call. Eight times makes it seem like a pretty obvious crime. It’s like if you went on trial for stabbing a guy and said, ‘It was an accident. He fell on the knife,’ and they said, ‘Eight times?’” —  SETH MEYERS “Yeah, Trump asked Ukraine for election help, or as he put it, ‘I was just trying to make Putin jealous.’” —  JIMMY FALLON “Right now Eric and Don Jr. are thinking, ‘Damn, he pays more attention to Biden’s kid.’” —  JIMMY FALLON “Today reporters asked Trump if he did anything wrong. He was like, ‘Yeah, I probably should have asked for dirt on Elizabeth Warren.’” —  JIMMY FALLON “We spent years talking about Russia; it might be Ukraine that takes down Trump. Who saw that coming? That’s like looking both ways before you cross the street then getting hit by a drone.”  — JIMMY FALLON “Maybe even crazier is the fact that Trump did this on July 25th, the day after the Mueller testimony. So a day after the conclusion of a major investigation into whether he got help in an election from a foreign leader, he gets on the phone and asks for help from another foreign leader. It’s like the only thing I can compare it to is when Mike Tyson bit Evander Holyfield’s ear and then bit Evander Holyfield’s other ear.” —  JIMMY KIMMEL “The bottom line is it would appear the president used his office to ask a foreign country to dig up dirt on his opponent, and Democrats in Congress are thinking very seriously about threatening to maybe consider almost doing something about it.” —  JIMMY KIMMEL “Today Nancy Pelosi said, ‘Another five or 600 violations and we might think about impeachment.’”  — JIMMY FALLON “While addressing the whistle-blower complaint about Ukraine, Nancy Pelosi accused President Trump of endangering national security. Yeah, Nancy, where you been? You’re like, my mom’s friend who is watching Season 4 of ‘Breaking Bad’ and says, ‘I think this guy might be dealing meth.’” —  SETH MEYERS “I know they say that history repeats itself, but usually it’s after a few generations, not, like, two years later with the exact same person.”  — JAMES CORDEN The Punchiest Punchlines (Emmys Edition) “Only seven million people watched the Emmys, and one million of those were ‘Game of Thrones’ cast members.” —  CONAN O’BRIEN “This was the lowest-rated Emmys ever by a lot. They’re saying if things get any worse they may have to add themselves to the in memoriam reel.” —  JIMMY KIMMEL “The Emmys in memoriam section — you know, where we say goodbye to people — accidentally broadcast a photo of a person who’s not dead yet. Yes. Yeah. Today, the producers apologized profusely to Bernie Sanders.” —  CONAN O’BRIEN “The streaming platforms did very well last night. Twenty-seven Emmys for Netflix, seven Emmys for Amazon and three Emmys for Zappos.”  — CONAN O’BRIEN “So many of the awards last night went to foreigners. There were so many British people onstage, I didn’t know if I was watching the Emmys or the ‘Downton Abbey’ movie.” —  JIMMY KIMMEL The Bits Worth Watching Kimmel sidekick Guillermo caught Sunday night’s Emmy winners as they came off the stage for another series of his Back to Back interviews.

"Trump says Democrats' impeachment inquiry is a continuation of the 'witch hunt.' Some Democrats grumbled in recent weeks at the reluctance of House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi,  D-Calif., to launch an impeachment investigation of President Trump. But Pelosi argued that she needed to protect the most vulnerable Democratic members of Congress – the ones who in 2018 won 40 Republican House seats, including many in districts where most voters solidly supported Trump in 2016 and likely still do. Pelosi finally came around Tuesday. She did so after the most recent evidence of Trump asking the Ukrainian president to “look into” former Vice President  Joe Biden  and his son Hunter regarding the younger Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine and Joe Biden’s role in the dismissal of a prosecutor who was investigating the Ukrainian company on whose board Hunter Biden served. Pelosi spoke not long after several potentially vulnerable freshmen Democratic representatives announced their support for an impeachment investigation. DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE, DESCRIBE CALL AS MAFIA-STYLE ‘SHAKEDOWN’ Pelosi has – not surprisingly – behaved very much as the daughter of a politician (her father was a congressman and later mayor of Baltimore) would be expected to. She has stayed close to her base and shown she knows how to count votes. These are the same political skills she used to regain the speakership, even after presiding over the loss of a Democratic majority in the House. But the impeachment target, President Trump, has historic political skills of his own. For all the talk of him being a first-time politician, he has skills honed from years of New York tabloid wars and reality television. That’s no “diss.” This is a man who knows how to create suspense and navigate a career doing summersaults on a trapeze without a net. Don’t underestimate a resume that reads: a hotshot real estate developer, a tabloid celebrity and casino operator who declared corporate bankruptcy and recovered; a reality TV star; a Democrat turned leading Republican; and now someone who rides in Air Force One and sits in the Oval Office. Many have enjoyed laughing at Donald Trump, but few have made money betting against him. Pelosi knows how to play the inside political game – but Trump remains a master at the public art of politics. To date, Trump has been effective at convincing enough Americans to oppose impeachment. A  Fox News poll  in July – just before now-former Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress – showed that 45 percent of registered voters believed Trump should not be impeached, while 42 percent believed he should be impeached and removed from office. Another 5 percent believed Trump should be impeached but not removed. Many have enjoyed laughing at Donald Trump, but few have made money betting against him. The recent revelation that Trump sought to get the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden – the president’s potential 2020 reelection opponent – may change that, as could the House Democrats’ decision to open an impeachment investigation. But it’s equally likely that Americans will just move ever closer to their current polarized positions. My advice on polls about impeachment: start paying attention next week, after this current news cycle has played out and we can gauge public reaction. In the face of all this, here’s a look at the strategy that each side is likely to play. Pelosi and House Democrats have three goals in mind: keep their majority in the House, win the presidency, and see a Democratic majority in the Senate. They believe there is evidence against Trump – some of which the Trump administration has not been sharing – that either rises to the level of impeachment or at the least casts Trump in a very negative light. While some people argue that there is no way that a Republican-controlled Senate will find a two-thirds majority to convict and remove Trump from office, many Democrats may not care. They will find it strategically useful to have nonstop television news coverage of impeachment hearings about what they believe is evidence that will reflect negatively on the president. And while some Democrats say an impeachment investigation shouldn’t interfere with the 2020 election, others will welcome the chance to have the investigation play out just as the election campaign is in full swing. An alternative viewpoint is that Trump – in a way – welcomes the impeachment investigation. Those who hold this view believe it plays into the president’s theme that he is fighting against a “Deep State” in order to “drain the swamp.” Like President Bill Clinton (yes, Bill Clinton) and a champion bullfighter, Trump has shown himself to be most effective when his back is against the wall and everyone thinks he’s about to fail. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Despite six corporate bankruptcies, multiple accusations of wrongdoing against him, a special counsel’s investigation and daily attacks by Democrats and the media, Trump is still able to go thumbs-up behind the Resolute desk.  For those of us who refuse to underestimate Trump, the fact that he released a summary Wednesday of his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and spoke to reporters with Zelensky after the two met at the United Nations suggests Trump might have something up his sleeve. TRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT: READ THE DOCUMENT The summary shows that while Trump sought an investigation of Biden family dealings in Ukraine, there isn’t a direct quote explicitly linking the request to U.S. aid. Speaking to reporters alongside Trump,  Zelensky said  Wednesday that Trump did not pressure him to investigate the Biden family in the July 25 call. “Nobody pushed me,” Zelensky said. “We had a great phone call.” Republican senators – especially those up for reelection in 2020 – face a double bind. Polls universally show Trump with strong support among Republicans. As a result, if GOP senators attack Trump they open themselves to a threat of a Republican primary from that solid Trump base, or reduced turnout among Republicans in the general election. However, if Republican senators are too strongly associated with Trump and are seen as ignoring what many non-Republican voters see as his misconduct, the senators may find it difficult to win reelection in the battleground states of Arizona, Colorado, Maine, North Carolina and even Georgia. Republican senators seeking reelection in those states and others want the support of some independents and even moderate Democrats in November 2020. Interestingly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., came out in support of getting to the whistleblower complaint against President Trump regarding the call with Zelensky and apparently other issues released to Congress. McConnell’s reasoning appears to be that if the news is going to be bad, get it out quickly so it can fade in the public mind by November 2020. For the Democratic presidential hopefuls, the controversy over Ukraine and Biden is a bit of minefield. For Biden, the whole affair seems to cast him the way he wants: he’s the Democrat’s best chance to be elected president because he’s the guy Trump appears to fear most. On the other hand, even though there doesn’t appear to be anything to the accusation of improper conduct by the former vice president, it would not be the first time that Trump has forced the media to ask one of his adversaries the equivalent of “When did you stop beating your wife?” Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who was the first to come out in favor of the impeachment of Trump, may see some traction with her core message: See, I told you. And as with other things, you can trust me that I know what we need to do. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For the other Democratic presidential contenders – especially those whose campaigns are still struggling for attention – recent developments are actually bad news: the developments shift attention from their campaign and onto the battle over impeachment. One thing is certain: the center ring of the political circus is going to be the outcome of the impeachment investigation of the president. And it’s a fight between a master of outsized public spectacle and a master of hidden vote counting. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ARNON MISHKIN"

"Trump addresses reporters at Joint Base Andrews after acting DNI Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.,  threw cold water on the whistleblower complaint on Thursday but demanded to know who in the  White House  spoke with the whistleblower and why they didn't file a complaint on their own. ""It is imperative we find out which White House official talked to the whistleblower and why. Why didn’t they lodge the complaint?"" he asked on Twitter. He seemed to refer to the White House officials the whistleblower complaint cited as being ""deeply disturbed"" by a call in which  President Trump  urged  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  to investigate  former Vice President Joe Biden . WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT ON UKRAINE CALL RELEASED, ALLEGES TRUMP SOLICITED FOREIGN 'INTERFERENCE' IN ELECTION The White House released a rough transcript of the call on Wednesday, revealing that it contained no evidence of a quid pro quo for foreign aid. The House Intelligence Committee continued pressing the issue on Thursday, as Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the panel. Republicans have panned the report as benign and alleged Democrats were grasping at straws in trying to attack the president. Graham seemed to agree, calling the report a ""pig in a poke"" bought by Democrats. He also blasted the whistleblower complaint as an obvious effort to hurt the president. ""As to the other matters in complaint: Clearly a coordinated effort to take second-hand information to create a narrative damaging to the President,"" he tweeted. ""When I think of whistleblower complaints I generally think of someone with first-hand knowledge of the events in question."" As Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted, the whistleblower filed the complaint without witnessing the events himself. Rather, the individual relied on second-hand accounts. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He also appeared to think  Democrats  were bluffing on impeachment, arguing that if the whistleblower report was as big a deal as they made it out to be, the House should vote to pursue an impeachment inquiry. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,  announced on Tuesday that she would launch an official inquiry but the House has yet to vote on official proceedings."
"Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, went after House Intelligence Committee Chairman  Adam Schiff , D-Calif., for presenting a  faulty narrative  to the American public Thursday about what transpired on a phone call between President Trump and the president of Ukraine. Wenstrup, a member of the committee, spoke on  ""Outnumbered Overtime""  after the hearing with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who was  called to testify  about his handling of the explosive whistleblower  complaint  alleging Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the Biden family. Schiff was  called out  during the hearing for at one point reading a fictionalized version of the phone call, later defending the statements as ""parody"" intended for dramatic effect. ""He made this up to fit his narrative. We have the transcript. ... He puts it out there and most of the media will run with that, they'll run with his narrative,"" said Wenstrup, arguing Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky both ran on cleaning up corruption in their respective countries and were discussing that during the call. WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT HAS BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND CONTAINS NO 'SURPRISES,' GOP LAWMAKER SAYS The hearing began shortly after  the public release  of a whistleblower complaint involving Trump asking the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The complaint alleged that Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from a foreign country in the 2020 election -- and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call. READ THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT ""In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced -- as is customary -- by the White House Situation Room,""  the complaint  says. Maguire's reputation was also on trial Thursday. He has come under fire from Democrats for initially withholding a copy of the complaint from lawmakers. That standoff was technically resolved when the complaint was declassified, and released to the public, in advance of the hearing. But Maguire was still pressed for answers from Democratic committee members on why his office did not hand over the complaint at first. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Maguire insisted he is ""not partisan"" and ""not political,"" reminding the panel that he served under eight presidents and has taken the oath of office 11 times. Wenstrup said Democrats tried to ""demean"" Maguire in the hearing and ""tear down"" a person of integrity. He said he believes the whistleblower will soon be called to testify behind closed doors so Democrats can say ""whatever they want"" about his testimony. Fox News' Ronn Blitzer and Brooke Singman contributed to this report."
"Ohio Sen. Rob Portman weighs in on U.S. aid package to Ukraine. Political  partisans are very good at certain things, including mental gymnastics. We can explain away almost anything that doesn’t support our party, candidate or worldview. Hyperbole and “whataboutism” are almost second nature. It’s not always pretty, but that’s the reality. That said, there are moments in time when the mental gymnastics aren’t worth it. This is one of those times. President Trump  has abused the power of his office to benefit himself to the detriment of the public good, which is an impeachable offense. If mental gymnastics were an Olympic sport, Republicans desperate to defend Trump would all be gold medal contenders WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT HAS BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND CONTAINS NO 'SURPRISES,' GOP LAWMAKER SAYS Trump’s request that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky “do us a favor” in looking into alleged corruption of a political opponent – former Vice President Joe Biden – is clear cut in the summary notes of the July 25 call between the two presidents that was released Wednesday by the White House. And we are now learning that Trump reportedly made a discussion of Biden a precondition of the phone call with Zelensky – an obvious abuse of power. ABC News reported  Wednesday that “Ukrainian officials came to recognize a precondition to any executive correspondence” between Zelensky and Trump was a commitment to discuss the involvement of Biden (Trump’s potential 2020 election opponent) and his son Hunter Biden in Ukraine. TRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT: READ THE DOCUMENT ABC reported: ‘""It was clear that [President Donald] Trump will only have communications if they will discuss the Biden case,""’ said Serhiy Leshchenko, an anti-corruption advocate and former member of Ukraine's Parliament, who now acts as an adviser to Zelensky. ‘This issue was raised many times. I know that Ukrainian officials understood.""’ As a legal standard, we don’t even need a quid pro quo to impeach, though it is present in the notes of the call. Against the backdrop of nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine that was frozen by Trump before the call – and that Ukraine urgently needed to defend itself against Russian aggression – the two presidents had this exchange, according to the White House’s rough summary: Zelensky’s quid: “Thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.” (Javelins are anti-tank missiles). Trump’s Quo: “I would like you to do us a favor though….” There’s more, of course. Trump’s mention of reciprocity; his request that Ukraine investigate  Biden; and his mention that his people (Attorney General William Barr and Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani) will be in touch with Ukraine all read like a classic mob shakedown. As journalist Ryan Lizza put it: “Anyone who has ever listened to the Gotti tapes will recognize the subtlety here.” I’ve heard the tapes of the late Mafia boss and Lizza is spot on. And by the way, why was Trump using his personal attorney rather than U.S. government officials to deal with a foreign country? This was not only highly inappropriate, but ironic, given that Giuliani made his reputation as a crusading U.S. attorney in New York City by prosecuting Mafia figures.  What’s more, we know what lengths the Trump administration at first went to avoid allowing the whistleblower complaint against Trump regarding his call with Zelensky becoming public. The Washington Post reports that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire threated to resign over concerns that the White House may force him to stonewall Congress when he testifies Thursday morning. Maguire has denied the resignation threat publicly, but released a letter emphasizing his commitment to protecting whistleblowers and has pushed the White House to make explicit whether it would assert executive privilege. He is no doubt caught in a fight between Congress and the White House. Buckling to pressure from Democrats, the Trump administration turned over the whistleblower complaint about the Trump-Zelensky phone call to select members of congressional intelligence committees Wednesday afternoon, along with related documents. And Wednesday night Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said on “The Ingraham Angle” on Fox News Channel that the whistleblower complaint has been declassified, though it was not immediately publicly available. In announcing the beginning of a formal impeachment inquiry, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was clear that the Trump-Zelensky call isn’t the only instance by Trump of impeachable conduct, but is the most easily digestible. She’s absolutely right. I have been against the idea of a formal impeachment inquiry since we saw the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. That isn’t because I don’t believe that President Trump obstructed justice. I think it’s quite obvious that he did, and I wish that Justice Department guidelines allowed for Mueller to make a decision one way or the other on charging Trump with obstruction. The Mueller report was enough for dozens of Democrats to get on board with impeachment, but not Pelosi and certainly not a majority of moderate House Democrats who either found the argument for impeachment not compelling or felt the politics were too dangerous for Democrats. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Things are different today and there is little ambiguity. Impeachment remained unpopular before now, with the latest Quinnipiac poll showing that only 37 percent of Americans supported impeachment, with 57 percent against. And while 73 percent of Democrats were supportive, we know that the country is made up of more than just Democrats and that the politics of impeachment remain perilous. But it remains to be seen what impact the rapidly unfolding revelations on Trump’s efforts to use Ukraine to hurt Biden’s candidacy will have on public sentiments about the need for impeachment. We’ll get a better reading on this when new polls come out in the next few weeks.  It’s important to remember that these are perilous times and things change, as they did during impeachment hearings for President Richard Nixon in 1974, when public support for impeachment grew dramatically. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Today we have a president who is abusing the power of his office for his personal and political gain, putting his own interests ahead of America’s. He clearly should not be entrusted with the highest office in the land. The mental gymnastics to avoid coming to that conclusion are too much to ask, even of the biggest partisans. I know that the prospect of a Democratic president feels like an intolerable nightmare to millions of Americans, but the prospect of supporting a man with so little regard for the office of the presidency and the American people is an intolerable nightmare we are all living through today.

The latest allegations of corruption leveled against  President Trump  over his phone call with the president of Ukraine and the Democratic Party's push for impeachment ignited a spirited debate Wednesday on "" The Five. "" ""I think, just the bottom line, the Democrats are trying to impeach Trump for crimes that they themselves committed,"" co-host  Jesse Watters  said. ""These are nasty, ruthless, destructive, hypocritical people and it's going to take a lot of energy to fight back their deceit and their lies."" Watters and his fellow co-hosts were reacting to a press conference given by Trump in New York hours after a transcript of the phone call was released by the White House.

Democrats initiated an  impeachment inquiry  Tuesday following the whistleblower's complaint that Trump had improperly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden. Zelensky, speaking while sitting with Trump at a bilateral meeting on the sideline of the United Nations Gereral Assembly Wednesday, told reporters he did not feel ""pushed"" at all in his conversations with the president. WATCH: UKRAINE PRESIDENT BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS HE WASN'T PRESSURED Watters argued that Democrats believe Biden is ""above the law"" and are accusing Trump of the crimes actually committed by the former vice president. ""So at this point, the Democrats are accusing Trump of crimes they committed,"" Watters said. Dana Perino  later asked co-host  Juan Williams  if Democrats were premature in their announcement of an impeachment inquiry. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Williams said he agreed with the stance taken by the Democratic Party, before mentioning that the White House had  accidentally sent talking points  on the transcript to Democrats and sparking a reaction from Watters and co-host  Greg Gutfeld . ""Asking a foreign government to investigate a political rival is illegal,"" Williams continued. Fox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report."
"  On the heels of Wednesday's release of an  official summary  of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, the complaint gives us two major takeaways -- both making impeachment more likely.     First, every scandal needs a coverup, and now the Ukraine case has its very own.  We learned that White House lawyers allegedly instructed other staffers to store records of the damning July 25 phone call on a server normally reserved for extremely sensitive classified information. Records of the Trump-Zelensky phone call ordinarily would have no business on such a server; according to the complaint, storage on the classified server was ""an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.""   Have questions on impeachment?  Share them below, and we'll answer as many as we can.    As the whistleblower notes, the intent was to ""lock down"" evidence of the conversation. This move shows us that Trump's closest advisers recognized quickly that the call posed a major problem and bucked normal protocol to try to hide it. Lawyers call this ""consciousness of guilt"" -- meaning that when people try to hide evidence or influence witnesses or otherwise obstruct justice, they typically do so for a reason. This kind of proof can be devastating in court (or, in this case, eventually in the House and later the Senate).   The second big revelation is that Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was so centrally involved in Trump's effort to push the Ukrainian government to dig for dirt on Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Giuliani already has spoken publicly (and  inconsistently ) about his efforts to mine political dirt on Trump's political rivals, and the whistleblower complaint similarly casts him as a ""central figure"" in the illicit undertaking.    Giuliani's involvement in Trump's efforts to have Ukraine gather dirt on political opponents is itself a major problem for Trump: why on earth was Giuliani -- a private citizen and not an employee of the US government -- involved in any of this at all?  The answer, it seems, is that Trump's dealings with Ukraine were intended for his own personal and political benefit and not for (or perhaps at the expense of) the best interests of the United States.      Trump has already gone on the offensive,  attacking  the whistleblower's credibility (while also  allegedly implying , outrageously, that whoever provided  the whistleblower information was  ""close to a spy""  who should be punished -- treading and likely crossing the line of criminal  witness tampering ).     But Trump's attacks on the whistleblower's credibility simply don't fly. Trump's own appointed intelligence community inspector general formally deemed the whistleblower complaint  credible . And the whistleblower in the complaint somehow managed to give a spot-on description of Trump's pivotal July 25 phone call.  Trial lawyers call this corroboration -- meaning the witness is backed up by some reliable, outside evidence.  The House Intelligence Committee has a daunting and complex investigative task ahead of it. And the whistleblower complaint serves as a helpful roadmap. Speak with every relevant person referenced in the complaint. Subpoena any emails or texts relating to the effort to bury documents. Interview (and subpoena if necessary) State Department officials who may (or may not) have authorized Giuliani to conduct official business on behalf of the United States.    The evidence is piling up.  Trump and his defenders are going into battle mode. We learned on Thursday that one of their primary targets for counterattack, the whistleblower, will not be easily dismissed or discredited."
