"However, some senior administration officials, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, are against the idea because of the precedent releasing it could set with future foreign leaders. At particular issue: White House concern about giving Congress ammunition to demand transcripts of Trump's calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump's acknowledgment that he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden in a July call with Ukraine's president has intensified scrutiny on his interactions and decisions on Ukraine. On Friday CNN reported Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump remained unclear about the fate of the transcript on Monday, speaking about the Ukraine controversy multiple times during his visit to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. ""Perhaps you'll see it, perhaps you won't see that, it depends on what we want to do,"" Trump said of the transcript. The President again denied that he threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine unless the country's leaders did his bidding and investigated the Bidens. ""I did not make a statement that, 'You have to do this or I'm not going to give you aid.' I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that,"" he said. But Trump again suggested he hoped to release a transcript of his conversation.  ""It was a very nice call. I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon,"" he said. More mixed signals House Democrats have demanded to see the full complaint a whistleblower filed last month with the intelligence community inspector general -- a document the administration, including the White House Counsel's Office and the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel -- has fought to keep secret. The complaint includes the Ukraine call, a source told CNN, but may not necessarily be limited to that one incident. Over the weekend, White House officials solicited opinions from outside advisers about whether they should release the transcript of Trump's call with the Zelensky, as well as how advisers think the White House should message it if the transcript was ""embarrassing."" A person familiar with the discussions said the White House Counsel's Office is currently involved in evaluating whether the transcript should be released and in what form. The source said the release could happen ""soon."" But Stephanie Grisham, White House press secretary, sounded a reluctant note this morning on Fox News. ""I do think that perhaps releasing this kind of a transcript could set a bad precedent. He is willing to do it, I think. But there is a lot of other people, lawyers and such that may have a problem with it. So we will see what happens,"" Grisham said. Officials are also looking at potential redactions of Zelensky's portion of the conversation. On Saturday, Trump raised the possibility of releasing a transcript of the call to a ""respected source"" for review. In March, White House counsel Pat Cipillone sent a letter to Congress saying the administration would not release any conversations Trump has had with foreign leaders, citing longstanding precedent. That letter came in the context of White House efforts to shield Trump's conversations with Putin. But releasing the Zelensky call could undermine the White House's pre-existing efforts to keep those Putin conversations secret, which is one of several concerns inside the White House over putting out details of the call. 'A terrible precedent' Another concern -- voiced on the Sunday shows by Pompeo and Mnuchin -- is that publishing the call could chill candor when Trump speaks with foreign leaders in the future. Both suggested Trump requires an expectation of privacy in order to conduct diplomacy effectively.   ""I think that would be a terrible precedent,"" Mnuchin said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""Conversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential, and if every time someone for political reasons raised a question, and all of a sudden those conversations were disclosed publicly ... then why would world leaders want to have conversations together?"" Pompeo echoed a similar reservation. ""We don't release transcripts very often. It's the rare case. Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn't be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances. There's no, there's no evidence that would be appropriate here at this point,"" Pompeo  said on ABC's ""This Week."" A number of political advisers have urged the White House to release it, with full knowledge of the diplomatic concerns cited by Mnuchin and Pompeo over the weekend.  ""Otherwise, it looks like we're hiding something far more nefarious,"" one person said. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, publicly urged Trump to publish the transcript on Monday and hinted the White House could do so in the days ahead. ""I would just urge the President ... to release as much as possible. And here's what I think -- I think you're going to find (out) more about that phone call in the coming days,"" Graham said during on appearance on Hugh Hewitt's radio show. ""You're going to be surprised about the level of transparency regarding that phone call."" One senior administration official said there's an understanding inside the White House that the timing of the administration's suspension of the Ukraine aid, which came around the time of Trump's call with the Ukrainian president, ""lends to a question of what was going on.""  But this official, like the President, insists there was no quid pro quo. Trump himself told reporters yesterday while leaving the White House that he wants to release the call. But he later said one way to release the call, given concerns about protecting American interests, would be to ""give it to a respected source."" He said in Houston on Sunday that if the call was released, people would ""see one of the finest, one of the nicest"" conversations."
"The Wall Street Journal reports that in a July phone call, President Trump repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son. The controversy over President Trump’s  mysterious call  with a foreign leader that prompted a whistleblower complaint ratcheted up Friday afternoon as a new report said it involved Trump asking the president of Ukraine numerous times in a single phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. Meanwhile, after Trump called the whistleblower a partisan and dismissed the allegation as “another political hack job,” Democrats in Congress accused the president of trying to intimidate whistleblowers and demanded the administration hand over the complaint and a transcript of the call, while 2020 hopefuls renewed calls for impeachment. CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. In a lengthy statement Friday evening, Biden said that if the reports were true ""there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.  ""This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,"" Biden continued. ""It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation—a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia—pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor ..."" ""At minimum,"" Biden concluded, ""Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress."" What initially touched off the  controversy is a secret  whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM   Trump called that initial story “ridiculous” in the Oval Office, and said he doesn’t know the identity of the whistleblower. He wouldn’t say what was discussed in the call but said someone should “look into” Biden family connections to Ukraine. ""I have conversations with many leaders. It's always appropriate. Always appropriate,"" Trump said. ""At the highest level, always appropriate. And anything I do, I fight for this country."" Afterward, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democratic committee leaders issued a statement demanding the administration hand over the complaint, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would not share details of it with lawmakers. “President Trump just went on national television—from the Oval Office—and personally attacked an Intelligence Community whistleblower who reported an urgent matter involving serious or flagrant misconduct,"" the statement said, adding that the ""brazen effort to intimidate this whistleblower risks a chilling effect on future whistleblowers."" After the publication of the Journal’s story, 2020 Democrats quickly weighed in. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro said that Trump “is a criminal.” “He must be impeached immediately,” he said. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said that Trump “appears to be collaborating with foreign governments to attack America’s democracy” before she urged the whistleblower to come forward. “I would absolutely urge this whistleblower to go directly to Congress, whether in closed session or in open session,” she said. Schiff told reporters Friday that the whistleblower claim ""deserves a thorough investigation."" ""Come hell or high water, that’s what we’re going to do,” he said. Democrats have been looking into whether Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure the government to investigate the Biden activities, and have also sought a transcript of the July call between Trump and Zelensky. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The inspector general for the intelligence community received the whistleblower complaint and, according to correspondence with Schiff, considered the allegations “credible” and dealing with an “urgent concern.” Inspector General Michael Atkinson wrote that the DNI, “after consulting with the Department of Justice,” determined the complaint does not have to be shared with the intelligence committees under law. He wrote that he will “abide by that determination,” but disagrees with it. In a letter Tuesday, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of ""urgent concern."" He said the complaint ""concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision."" Maguire is expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. after being subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee. Schiff had accused Maguire of withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioned whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general. Fox News' Alex Pappas, Hillary Vaughn, Andrew Craft and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"In a tweet, Romney, who was his party's presidential nominee in 2012, also said it was ""critical"" for the facts surrounding the call to emerge. ""If the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,"" Romney, who represents Utah, wrote in the  tweet.  The comments from the prominent GOP senator are some of the strongest to come from his party, whose members have largely remained silent following news last week that a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General was concerned in part with a July 25 call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Sunday, after Trump acknowledged that he  discussed Biden during the call  but maintained that the conversation was ""warm and friendly,"" congressional Democrats urged an investigation into the matter, with some calling for Trump's impeachment.  CNN previously reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to  investigate Biden's son, Hunter,  according to a person familiar with the situation. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump previously branded criticism of the call a ""Ukranian Witch Hunt,"" while Biden accused the President of abusing his power to ""smear"" him. In comments to reporters on Sunday, the President said he hopes officials release details of the call, but slammed the whistleblower responsible for filing a complaint. On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a strong warning to the administration, which has  refused to hand over the whistleblower complaint,  saying it ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness"" if the resistance persists. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, meanwhile, said Sunday that impeachment ""may be the only remedy"" to Trump's refusal to make public the complaint and phone call transcript. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential candidate, and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both Democrats,  urged Congress to impeach Trump  over the matter on Saturday, writing in tweets that their colleagues had an obligation to do so. "

"HOUSTON — A groan erupted at a  debate  watch party at Texas Southern University last week as former vice president  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  got a question about slavery and racism and  gave an answer about Venezuela and record players .  But amid that exasperation, some students channeled their inner Beltway operatives and began a targeted  rapid-response campaign.   Tyler Smith, 19, texted his grandmother after the debate, hopeful that Mr. Biden's meandering answer may have swayed her from supporting him.  Amaya St. Romain, 19, mounted a three-day lobbying blitz on her mother and her great-grandmother, making sure they had seen the former housing secretary  Julián Castro ’s criticisms of Mr. Biden onstage.  In  meme-speak ,  the efforts amounted to Killmonger, the villain in the Black Panther movie, challenging the people of Wakanda:  “Is this your king?”   “I think I’m definitely influencing them,” Ms. St. Romain said of her family members. “But my dad is definitely still pro-Biden. And I don’t really argue with him.”  If Mr. Biden,  76 , is going to win the  Democratic nomination , it is likely to be because of the  support of older black voters , a key constituency for the party  and one that polls show is overwhelmingly supportive of the former vice president’s candidacy .  But if he is to be overtaken by one of his more progressive rivals, the most powerful tool against him may not be opposition research or negative advertisements. Instead, it may be an organic effort by younger black voters — concerned about Mr. Biden’s age and more moderate ideology — to sway their older family members. Mr. Biden seems aware of this dynamic. In interviews, he has both acknowledged the generational gap among his black supporters and downplayed its importance,  arguing that the support of older, more moderate black voters  would be enough to give him an electoral advantage.  Still, Mr. Biden, by his own admission, would be unwise to underestimate the lobbying efforts of those who are young and politically engaged. At a gathering of the New Hampshire Young Democrats in July, Mr. Biden said the same phenomenon — young people converting their skeptical parents — had helped fuel his own ascension in politics almost 47 years ago, when he was elected to the Senate as a fresh-faced 29-year-old.  “The fact of the matter is, you have more influence on how your parents vote than they have on you,” Mr. Biden  said  in July. “You may sit at the dining room table, having dinner with your mom and dad, and say, ‘I met her and I really like her,’ or ‘I met him and I really like him.’ And your parents will pretend it didn’t matter much. But they’ll go up, not a joke, they’ll go up and say, ‘If my kid liked that person that much, and knew them, there must be something there.’”  At Texas Southern University, a historically black university founded in 1927 and the site of last week’s Democratic debate, dozens of students, ages 19 to 23, differed on their top candidate. Senators  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont,  Elizabeth Warren  of Massachusetts, and  Kamala Harris  of California were among the favorites, as was one of the two Texans in the race, former Representative  Beto O’Rourke .  For Mr. Biden, though, students carried mixed feelings. They respected his tenure as Barack Obama’s vice president, but implicitly rejected his campaign’s central premise, that the primary goal of Democrats in the 2020 election should be defeating President Trump.  They pointed to systemic problems they said the country must address, such as inequality, climate change and gun violence. The Democratic nominee, they said, should embrace progressive proposals like canceling student loan debt, the Green New Deal and gun buyback programs.  “Me and my dad have the debate all the time,” said Samantha Williams, 19, a sophomore. “We want a candidate that reflects us and what the world is going to look like when we run. But  he  says what we call ‘woke’ is really just sensitive.”  Jaylan Jones, 20, said, “Older people have that conservative outlook on things,” even older black Democrats.  “Young people don’t want Biden. We want Beto. We want Bernie,” said Ms. Jones, a junior. “I think we can convince them.”  The difference in opinion across generations speaks to the changing politics of black communities, said Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, the racial justice organization.  And the  historically diverse Democratic field  has given voters plentiful options to choose from: multiple black candidates, white progressives  who openly back once-radical ideas like reparations , and Mr. Biden, who served as vice president to the first black president.  Black voters are overwhelmingly members of the Democratic Party, and polls show they have long regarded Mr. Trump as a racist president and individual whom they are desperate to replace. A  recent national poll  of Democratic primary voters from NBC and The Wall Street Journal showed Mr. Biden had the support of nearly 50 percent with black respondents, though others have shown a less commanding lead. “Black people are strategic voters, particularly older black people,” Mr. Robinson said. “They’re thinking harm reduction. They’re doing a deep analysis about what they think white people will accept and won’t accept.” He pointed to the last Democratic primary, when younger black voters tracked more toward Mr. Sanders than their older counterparts, who overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton. In 2008, younger black voters supported Barack Obama in much bigger numbers than the electorate at large, until his victory in the Iowa Caucus led to a surge of support.  “Young people are constantly signaling what’s next and what’s possible,” Mr. Robinson said. “And while there’s some love for Biden, but sometimes you’re in a relationship because you’re comfortable and it’s what you know.”  Another Texas Southern student, Christopher Anwuri, 22, said the generational differences in how black voters saw the primary were fueled by opposing theories of political change: incrementalism versus immediate upheaval.  “This generation is looking for an instant, quick fix for problems,” he said. Older black people, meanwhile, think “these things need to take time.”  It also comes back to Mr. Obama, and  the long shadow he casts over national Democratic politics , particularly in black communities. Older black voters invoke his name in deference, and cite his embrace of  Mr. Biden  as something that helped him win the trust of skeptical white voters in 2008.  To younger generations, many of whom were in high school or younger at the time, Mr. Obama’s achievements exist on their own. Their first memories of Mr. Biden stem from his highly meme-able vice-presidential years. They are also more likely to hold his long and at times controversial record — on  criminal justice ,  school segregation  and the  Clarence Thomas hearings , among other things — against him.  Jayla Lee, 19, said older black voters “like Biden because he was with Obama, and they feel like since they could trust Obama that means they can trust him.”  “But the things we endure are not the things they endured,” Ms. Lee said. “And I’m looking for someone who can change the things that affect me.”  Darren Black, 22, said older generations were always “going to ride” for Mr. Biden, because “Joe was there with Obama.”  “But the younger generation, we've seen mass shootings, we’re seeing more police brutality — we’re looking at different things,” Mr. Black said.  Yet contrary to their stereotype as idealistic and apathetic, and with the steely pessimism of seasoned political operatives, younger voters expressed a cleareyed understanding that their efforts to lobby their relatives would not necessarily be successful.  Asked if she’d had any luck converting her family to more progressive candidates, Ms. Williams, a political science major, said, “I’m making no progress. None. Not even a tiny bit. I wish.” Ms. Williams called her pro-Biden father a lost cause. “We’re both opinionated and headstrong people, a nd I just don’t have the energy to go back and forth,” she said.  Mr. Smith, a member of the school’s College Democrats, said he liked Mr. Biden, but preferred his more left-wing rivals, such as Mr. O’Rourke, Mr. Castro, Ms. Harris or Ms. Warren.  After the debate, he thought about further pestering his grandmother over her support for Mr. Biden, but he reconsidered out of fear of coming off as pushy.  “You know, it’s grandma, so you got to let her have it,” Mr. Smith said.  When reached by phone, however, Mr. Smith’s grandmother, Alice Varnado, said his previous lobbying efforts had been more successful than he may have realized.  Ms. Varnado, 69, said she still preferred Mr. Biden, but that she had grown concerned about his age in recent months. She said she would vote for whichever Democrat earned the nomination, but she now considers Ms. Warren her second choice.  Her family members — Mr. Smith and his uncle — had convinced her. “You know, since talking with my grandson and my son, I think I can go with her,” said Ms. Varnado. “I’m starting to like her. There’s been a turning point.”  Katie Glueck contributed reporting."

"The Deep State tried to use an illegitimate tool to throw up a smokescreen to distract the American people from President Trump's success, says former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. Republicans in  Congress  defended  President Trump  on Friday after a report said a ""whistleblower"" filed a complaint over an apparent July phone call between the president and the leader of Ukraine, blasting the allegations as ""highly partisan."" “It’s not like we haven’t seen this movie before,"" U.S. Rep.

""Democrats come out, they’re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out -- Whoa, different story! “This seems to be the same kind of deal,"" Jordan added. “It’s not like we haven’t seen this movie before. Democrats come out, they’re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out -- Whoa, different story!"" WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM The complaint made by an unnamed intelligence official, reportedly involved Trump asking Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son for alleged wrongdoing while the elder Biden was vice president. U.S. Rep.  Mark Meadows , R-N.C., echoed the idea that such complaints hamper the president in his work. “It would have a real chilling effect on dialogue between important leaders if they think that every time someone who overhears a conversation that wasn’t even party to the conversation is going to file a whistleblower complaint and it’ll end up on the front page of periodicals across the country,” Meadows said, according to The Post. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., said private phone calls with foreign leaders are part of the president’s job. “The fact is, the president, to quote John Marshall, is the ‘sole organ’ of U.S. external relations and has to have conversations in confidence with foreign leaders,"" he said. “There’s no practical way to conduct diplomacy without it.” “The fact is, the president ... has to have conversations in confidence with foreign leaders. There’s no practical way to conduct diplomacy without it.” But he added he’s in favor of transparency. The administration is also taking flak for not sharing the complaint with Congress. Most Republicans avoided commenting on the complaint, and while a few did express concerns, they were limited. Rep. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., said it would be “wildly inappropriate” for a president to ask a foreign government to get involved in a U.S. election, but added he isn’t accusing Trump of doing that. Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, broke with Republicans in saying some on his side of the aisle might join Rep.

"WASHINGTON — Everyone here is keyed up for the Big One. The One that’s going to finally bring Donald Trump down. As soon as the news  broke Wednesday night in The Washington Post  that a whistle-blower had accused the president of making some sort of nefarious “promise” during a call to a foreign leader, the hive erupted. Democrats haven’t been able to get Trump on paying off a porn star to protect his campaign. They haven’t been able to get him on being a Russian agent. They haven’t been able to get him on obstruction of justice. But maybe this time. Maybe this was the One where all would decide that they wanted impeachment, that the president’s behavior was so outrageous that they couldn’t imagine this sleazy business guy sitting in the Oval Office playing a tinpot dictator in a tinfoil hat for another second. Maybe this was the One that would finally move Republicans to turn on the Grendel who is terrorizing the village and gulping down their party. Certainly, Trump himself didn’t think so. As the capital was going into overdrive-freak-out mode Friday night trying to flesh out the whistle-blower story, the president was busy tweeting about a children’s book by a Fox News host: “Buy this Book — great for the kids!” If House Democrats can ever get their paws on the whistle-blower, maybe they can make up for the Judiciary Committee’s performance with Corey Lewandowski this past week, which left many wondering if these hearings designed to pry Trump out of office are just making Democrats look foolish. They certainly provide an ample platform for Trump loyalists to rail against their favorite deep state foils. When failed presidential candidate Eric Swalwell tried to get Lewandowski to read a message Trump had dictated to him, the witness nastily referred to the Democrat as “President Swalwell” and told him to read the message himself. The internecine strains between the impeach-now Nadler crowd and the get-him-out-in-2020 Pelosi crew grew more bitter.  Politico reported  that in a closed-door meeting, Speaker Nancy Pelosi shocked lawmakers and aides by harshly criticizing the House Judiciary Committee staffers for propelling the impeachment effort far beyond where the Democratic caucus stands. “And you can feel free to leak this,” Pelosi said acidly. In an  interview with NPR , she said she hadn’t changed her mind on impeachment, but she does think Congress should pass new laws so future presidents can be indicted. She said everyone had now seen what the founding fathers could not imagine: a president blatantly abusing the Constitution he has sworn to protect. Trump has certainly been working hard to prove Pelosi right that presidents should not ever be above the law. By Friday night, while Trump was readying for a state dinner with his ultraconservative  pal from down under , Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison,   The Wall Street Journal and The Times  were reporting  that the secret whistle-blower complaint involved this: President Trump repeatedly pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine — about eight times,  The Journal said  — to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s loony personal lawyer, to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. Giuliani has been pushing a story about the former vice president and his son, who had ties to a Ukrainian oligarch. After a fair bit of babbling on Chris Cuomo’s CNN show, Giuliani spit out some truth, that he asked the Ukrainians to look into the Bidens. Later  he tweeted : “A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.” Crooked Donald thinks he can create a crooked Joe narrative just like he created a Crooked Hillary one. Which is it, Donald: Crooked or Sleepy? So just consider this: Around the same time that Trump escaped the noose after Robert Mueller’s tepid testimony, sliding away from charges that he colluded with a foreign country to interfere in our election, he began arm-twisting another foreign country to interfere in our election. “Questions have emerged,”  The Times said , “about whether Mr. Trump’s push for an inquiry into the Bidens was behind a weekslong White House hold on military aid for Ukraine. The United States suspended the military aid to Ukraine in early July, according to a former American official.” So the president is under suspicion of making like Nixon and abusing power to go after his enemies, saying it would be a shame if anything happened to that military aid that you want because you don’t dig up some dirt on the son of my political rival. The administration kept the whistle-blower’s complaint from Congress, even though Congress has the legal authority to know what this urgent complaint is about. Pelosi issued an acerbic statement on Friday, noting that Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, was violating the law by refusing to disclose the complaint to Congress. “If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,” she said. Trump is literally acting like an international mobster.  Roy Cohn would be so proud . So is this the Big One? We don’t know because so much has come before. But if it is? Now that would be Big.

"Sen. Cory Booker's staff has been put on notice that he has until the end of September 2019 to raise $2 million or he will be dropping out of the race; former DNC Chair Donna Brazile reacts. Sen. Cory Booker’s  presidential campaign manager is warning in a memo to staff that the  Democratic senator from New Jersey  must raise an additional $1.7 million by the end of the third quarter of fundraising – just 10 days away – or the campaign will not have a “legitimate long-term path forward.” In the memo , campaign manager Addisu Demissie warned that following a weaker than expected cash haul during the early part of September, “the next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race."" BOOKER VOICES CONCERNS OVER BIDEN'S ABILITY 'TO CARRY THE BALL' The existence of the memo was first reported Saturday morning by NBC News, with Fox News confirming the news with multiple sources. Two sources, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said it was no accident that the memo was leaked, and described it as an effort to spark a surge in fundraising over the next 10 days.  And a campaign memo sent to political reporters Saturday morning said: “This isn't an end-of-quarter stunt or another one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press. This is a real, unvarnished look under the hood of our operation at a level of transparency unprecedented in modern presidential campaigns.” Booker, who declared his candidacy for the White House in early February, quickly built a formidable operation in the early voting primary and caucus states. The large staff on the ground in Iowa, New Hampshire, and other early voting states is expensive to maintain. Demissie warned that while the campaign can continue at its current size and strength,  it needs more funding if it wants to expand.

"Dan Bongino said the Ukraine phone call scandal involving President Trump is the media's attempt to avenge their failed Russia collusion narrative. Fox News contributor  Dan Bongino  said the  Ukraine  phone call scandal involving  President Trump  is the media's attempt to avenge their failed  Russia collusion  narrative, and called their efforts a ""hoax,"" on "" Fox & Friends "" Monday. ""That is the collusion hoax part deux. This is the sequel ... the 'Empire Strikes Back' to the Star Wars collusion hoax,"" he said. ""This is another nonsense thing. I have pretty decent sources on this... When you're on these calls at the  White House ... It's a cabal of people on both sides ... listening -- writing stuff down."" ""Do you actually believe ... 10, 20 people heard Donald Trump sellout the United States of America and nobody said anything until a guy who or woman who didn't even hear it directly heard it from someone else? It's so ridiculous,"" Bongino added. ""I can't believe they're falling for this again."" SARAH SANDERS: MEDIA 'HAS EGG ON THEIR FACE' FROM FAILING TO MAKE RUSSIA COLLUSION NARRATIVE STICK Trump was accused of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy into investigating  Joe Biden  and his son, Hunter, for their ties to a natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, which was being investigated as part of a corruption case. This prompted Democratic lawmakers to call for the release of the entire transcript of the call. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bongino called  Rep. Adam Schiff , D-Calif., who serves as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a master conspiracy theorist and accused Democrats of contriving the narrative out of thin air, to try to topple the president. ""They're making this up,"" he said. ""Everybody should have known this was a hoax right away when Adam Schiff got in front of the cameras -- the lead hoaxer, the greatest conspiracy theorist in American history. He's the platinum award-winning medalist for conspiracy theories. The minute he got involved you should have known this was another hoax."" Schiff threatened to withhold funds from the intelligence community on Sunday if the transcript was not made available. Fox News' Edmund DeMarche contributed to this report"
"For just one September week each year, everyone from kings, presidents and prime ministers on down to food tasters fly in to New York City and jam into the United Nations headquarters, in what has become a cliched joke about "" diplomatic speed dating ."" But there's nothing funny about the top priority at this 74th year of UNGA year, which is  the world's climate emergency. The United Nations Climate Summit  The UN has arranged  a special Climate Action summit  on Monday September 23, before the formal speeches given by heads of state and governments that normally draw the most attention. Breaking with tradition,  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres  has told country leaders not to come to the podium Monday without ""concrete and transformative plans"" to halt rising global temperatures, achieve carbon neutrality and cut carbon emissions by 45 percent. VIPs with proposals have been told they have just three minutes to speak. How concrete the results of the summit will actually be is unclear. The UN doesn't have a global climate army to roam the planet stopping pollution, so it's up to the 193 nations of the UN to take action. What the UN will actually do is what some feel the organization sadly does best: collecting the speeches and other environmental brainstorms in a report. The aim is to pressure world leaders to do more, as the climate emergency worsens. Some have made it a top priority -- German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  will be in town for the climate summit, even though she's skipping the rest of the week. In contrast, US President Donald Trump will be in town, but he's skipping the climate summit -- instead  hosting a session on religious persecution  in the same building. Trump has previously avoided international meetings on climate.  Let the General Debate begin The so-called ""general debate"" begins on Tuesday September 24, and the first country to speak is Brazil, by longstanding tradition. It'll be the debut UNGA appearance of Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro, who recently vowed to attend even if in a wheelchair, following recent surgery. Expect fireworks: After high global concern over  massive fires and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon , the  pro-business Bolsonaro  is likely to take climate advocates head-on. He has already promised a ""speech that is different from those that came before"". Following him will be Donald Trump, who has stuck to the teleprompter previously, and last year  drew laughter from delegates  while praising his own administration.  The volume of Trump's appearances and his unpredictability have dominated the past two years of Trump at the General Assembly. Last year, he shocked the visiting Chinese Foreign Minister  by accusing Beijing of interfering in US elections  while both men sat at the Security Council table.  Trump was also the first US President to enter the building and take just a few steps before stopping in front of cameras and shouting reporters, to answer hot topic questions for three days. ""He completely sucked the oxygen out of UNGA,"" Richard Gowan, UN Director at the International Crisis Center says. The elephant in the secretariat This year,  a mysterious attack on Saudi oil fields  has provided some late drama to UNGA, as US officials point the finger at Iran, despite  its denials  and  claims of responsibility by Houthi rebels  in Yemen. The US, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and other Middle East players will all be under one roof for days. Some can't stray too far. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has been slapped by movement restrictions from the US, which confine him to a small zone near the UN headquarters. A senior UN official stated, ""tensions in the Gulf are going to be the backdrop to a lot of events and meetings."" Which leads us to the biggest question on the eve of UNGA: Will President Trump meet Iranian President Rouhani? ‎Nothing is planned between the two leaders, though both will be in the UN building amid the parade of delegations. The threats and rhetoric lobbed by both sides have been fierce. The US imposed more sanctions on Iran on Friday before the high-level week begins, and the Iranians say they don't need to talk. It looks like ""a zero chance for a meeting,"" says Gowan. ""Instead of a diplomatic breakthrough, we're likely to see a war of words."" The UN is meant to be a neutral ground for dueling sides to have dialogue, and chance face-to-face encounters are exactly what this international forum is good for. In 2000, then-US President Clinton and then Cuban President Fidel Castro suddenly stopped briefly for each other in a hallway, when relations between the nations were running cold. There is  still a debate whether a handshake took place . Who's coming to UNGA?  As of Friday, 91 heads of state had committed to attend. French President Macron will be in New York offering an expanded French leadership role as a global mediator, as the Trump administration pulls the US back from international forums. ‎With  significant angst at home  over the UK's planned withdrawal from Europe, Boris Johnson will make his first UNGA appearance in his role as prime minister. Brexit talks are scheduled with Ireland's leader and others. And Indian leader Narendra Modi and Pakistan's leader Imran Khan are both attending and speaking in the General Assembly. No talks are scheduled between them for now, as tensions remain high over  India's treatment of Kashmir,  a disputed territory. And of fresh interest to American audiences will be Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who debuts at UNGA right in the middle of a growing controversy: The US Congress wants to know if  Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden's son , who had business ties in the country. Biden, of course, is one of the main contenders for the US Democratic primary and could end up challenging Trump for the presidency next year. There are also UN meetings big and small on Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, and Myanmar. Apart from marathon hours of speeches, consider this: 630 meetings have been requested. The UN defines a meeting as a gathering of 15 or more people held within the UN for a maximum of three hours. There are ""no less challenges than last year"" affecting geopolitics around the world, said British UN Ambassador Karen Pierce. Expect demonstrators near the UN all day -- though the targets of their anger may not even see them through their tinted limousine windows as they rush to the UN, sirens sometimes wailing. The list of leaders who will not appear this year is also interesting: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping rarely attend, and will not be present this year. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu has canceled,  amid a post-election muddle  back home. Netanyahu, a former UN Ambassador, relishes his General Assembly speeches -- often with props of charts and diagrams -- and he has previously made for must-see TV in between lengthy boring speeches by others.  Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had been listed as a speaker, but is no longer coming in the wake of  multiple revelations of black- and brownface photos  that surfaced from his past, just before national elections. President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela has sent his regards but will not leave his turmoil-filled nation. His rival for the Venezuelan presidency -- National Assembly leader Juan Guaido, whose presidential authority has been acknowledged by more than 50 countries, including the US -- is unlikely to show but representatives will push the UN for future recognition of Guaido's claim to power. Although the immediate premises of the United Nations are international ground, the United States is still the host. According to the ""host country"" agreement, visitors traveling for official UN business are not supposed to be barred, and there was once a time when the US would impose a generous 25-mile radius cordon on international visitors it didn't like. But this year, the US is not holding back. In addition to the movement restrictions on Iran's Zarif, two Cuban diplomats living in New York who had planned to participate in UNGA were ordered expelled by the Trump administration, in a surprise Thursday announcement. And the remaining diplomats at the Cuban mission face the toughest restrictions among all countries: They're not allowed to leave the narrow island of Manhattan. And with all the traffic and security blockades, New Yorkers and tourists ‎too may feel no one can get off the island during this madhouse week."

"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Democratic presidential candidate  Bernie Sanders  released a plan Saturday to eliminate  $81 billion in past-due medical debt , going a step beyond his primary rivals who have called for a government-run health insurance program. “In America today, it is unacceptable that one out of every six Americans have past-due medical bills on their credit report, totaling $81 billion,” Sen. Sanders, I-Vt.,  said in a statement , adding: ""It is immoral and unconscionable that families across the country are being evicted, having their heat disconnected, or having their already-inadequate wages garnished because of crippling medical debt while the health care industry made more than $100 billion in profits last year."" SUPREME COURT COULD HEAR GROUNDBREAKING CASE THAT CHALLENGES UN IMMUNITY   Under his plan, Sanders said, the federal government would step in for the individual to negotiate and pay off past-due medical bills in collections reported to credit agencies. Sanders also vowed to create a public credit registry to replace the three for-profit credit reporting agencies in order to, as he put it: “remove the profit motive from assessing the creditworthiness of American consumers.” He said the registry would use ""public, transparent algorithm to determine creditworthiness that eliminates racial biases in credit scores."" The self-described democratic socialist added that he would exclude medical debt from credit reports and end credit checking for rental housing, employment, insurance and other non-lending practices. BIDEN GOES ON THE ATTACK OVER UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, PLEDGES TO BEAT TRUMP 'LIKE A DRUM' Sanders made no mention in the proposal of how he planned to cover the $81 billion cost.  According to Reuters , the Sanders campaign has said they would pay for the debt elimination proposal through a tax on corporations based on their pay for chief executives. The details of that proposal have not been released. During an interview with Fox News Sept. 3, Sanders acknowledged that $81 billion is ""a lot of money,"" but he added, ""Compared to what? Compared to the $1.5 trillion that Trump gave in tax breaks to the one percent and large corporations. Compared to the billions of dollars that we spent bailing out the crooks on Wall Street 11 years ago. It is a lot of money but I think it’s the right thing to do.” Sanders was one of the earliest supporters of “Medicare-for-All,” which would replace job-based and individual health insurance with a government-run plan. Other top Democratic rivals have expressed interest in a toned-down version of Medicare-for-All. Sen.  Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass. has endorsed Sanders' plan but said there may be different ways to achieve coverage for all. Former Vice President  Joe Biden  has called to extend the Affordable Care Act by adding a public option. Sanders has also released a plan to eliminate $1.6 trillion in student loan debt while also making public college tuition-free. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As for where he draws the line in wiping out debt, Sanders in his Sept. 3 interview said ""there's a difference"" between wiping out medical debt and credit card debt. ""I don't believe we wipe out credit card debt. You want something, you pay for it.,"" he said. ""If you want to go out and buy a fancy house, you want to go out and buy a yacht, and you go in debt, hey that’s your decision…But I do believe we have to make a distinction. Getting cancer is not your decision. And I think we have a moral obligation to do everything we can to cancel that debt.”"
"We've experienced the peaceful transfer of power for 230 years, including the constitutionally messy outcomes in 1876, 1888, 2000 and, well, 2016 for that matter. No tanks rolled through the streets and no shadow governments operated from underground bunkers even when the guy with the most votes didn't end up in the White House.  So why in 2019 do so many Americans -- across party lines --  believe  that if their candidate loses next year it can only be because the election was rigged?  Here's one place we can look: For the third time in his presidency, Donald Trump has an 86-point gap between what Republicans and Democrats think about him, according to the  latest Gallup approval poll . Ninety-one percent of Republicans approve of his job performance to date, while only 5% of Democrats feel the same.   This ties the highest gap  Gallup has ever measured in a single survey. President Obama had an 86-point gap two days before his reelection in 2012. President Bush hit the low 80s twice in the run up to his reelection. Reagan only made it into the 70s -- also in the fall of 1984. In all 3 cases, the partisan divide peaked during the days and weeks before a highly contested election.  We are still 14 months away from Election Day. But Americans on both sides appear primed and ready to vote.  Just four years ago , only 32% of voters said they were ""extremely interested"" in the 2016 election. But this week, that same poll shows 59% are extremely interested this time around. And if you only include self-identified partisans, the number jumps into the 60s.  And with stakes this high, Democratic voters appear to be grappling with their own dilemma: vote for a candidate who best exemplifies their visceral loathing for Donald Trump or vote for the candidate who is most likely to beat him?  Current polling shows the race for the Democratic nomination  is tightening  between Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren. But that doesn't mean voters are picking between them.  The polls are pretty clear that Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters  would prefer  to vote for Elizabeth Warren.  They think  she's won every debate so far. And as the 20,000 people who showed up to her New York City rally this week can attest, she leads Biden in voter  enthusiasm  by double digits.  But  nearly half  of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters believe that Biden is best positioned to beat Trump. Barely 1 in 10 think that of Warren.  If history is any indication, there's every reason to suspect the partisan divide heading into 2020 will get worse. After all, that 86% gap just means we have 14% more to go.   All of this is a big problem for Elizabeth Warren.   As David Leonhardt noted in the  New York Times  this week, Warren has struggled to win blue collar workers (you remember: the ones that gave Trump his narrow wins in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania?) in her own state of Massachusetts since 2012. She underperformed even her fellow down ballot Democrats in the last election. Voters on both sides of the aisle in these swing states are tuned in and eager to vote, but Biden out performs her in a head to head with Donald Trump in Wisconsin  by 9 points , for instance.  Of course, Joe Biden has his own lurking shadows.  Unlike Elizabeth Warren, who has developed her following based on her progressive appeal and solid debate performances, Biden's standing with the Democratic electorate seems largely driven by fear—fear of losing again to Donald Trump. If she can assuage that fear—or if another candidate can prove more viable—Joe Biden could be looking at a swift and total collapse. We've got a long way to go in this race, but the growing partisan divide around Donald Trump and the fear of losing to him in 2020 means electability will only grow in importance to Democratic primary voters. And that's bad news right now for every candidate whose name doesn't rhyme with Schmiden.   Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the 2020 election is 16 months away. "
"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines for Sept. 20 are here. Check out what's clicking today in entertainment. Rosario Dawson  penned an op-ed in which she said the current U.S. immigration policies feed into “a larger white nationalist narrative.” The 40-year-old actress, who is dating  2020 presidential  hopeful Sen.  Cory Booker , shared her thoughts in an article for The Daily Beast in which she pulled no punches speaking about the  Trump administration's  rhetoric on immigration, directly linking it to the  Aug. 3 shooting in Texas . “The story that the current administration repeats ad nauseam is about a “violent invasion” of immigrant hordes — the exact same words used by the gunman who targeted our Latino community and shot down 22 innocent people in El Paso last month,”  she wrote . “This last week’s denial of refugees from the Bahamas fleeing the destruction of Hurricane Dorian because they could be “very bad gang members” saw thousands of climate refugees abandoned to squalid conditions.” ROSARIO DAWSON POSTS TOPLESS VIDEO TO MARK 40TH BIRTHDAY The star highlighted the importance of telling positive stories about immigrants in the U.S. as well as the consequences of misrepresenting them.

       (Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for IMG) “ICE raids and hate crimes don’t happen in a vacuum. They operate as part of a larger white nationalist narrative, a continuation of manifest destiny-thinking remixed for the age of Twitter,” she wrote. WHY ROSARIO DAWSON REPORTEDLY DIDN'T ATTEND BOYFRIEND CORY BOOKER'S DEBATE NIGHT Dawson continued: “The truth is, this thinking is symptomatic of an old and still very much alive colonial disease. If we want to heal this country’s deep scars on these issues, we need to look at the root causes and treat them at the source. When it comes to immigration, this is more than just a political crisis—we’re suffering a crisis of our very humanity. And one way to change the debate in Washington is by changing the stories we produce and consume in our own lives.” Dawson pointed to a new web series that she helped make and co-stars in titled “The North Pole” as an example of something telling worthwhile stories about immigrants. The series is set in Oakland, Calif., and follows four young people as they deal with issues such as immigration struggles, wildfires, racial tensions and much more. The actress, who fans may know from roles in films like “Rent,” “Men in Black II” and “He’s Got Game,” is also known for her political activism. She backed  Sen. Bernie Sanders’  2016 campaign for president and then endorsed Green Party candidate Jill Stein once  Hillary Clinton  defeated him.

"Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden is fighting charges by Julian Castro that the former vice president's ideas are outdated; Peter Doocy reports from Houston. The Democratic National Committee’s raising the bar for  presidential candidates  to qualify for November’s fifth-round  primary debate .  But, the upping of polling and donor thresholds – more modest than the doubling of the criteria from July’s second round to this month’s third round – may not significantly winnow the field of  White House contenders  still standing after  October’s debate. The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates. OCTOBER DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE TO BE HELD IN OHIO But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar. The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria. ""Qualification period ends 1 week (not 2 weeks) before the debate, giving candidates more time to qualify,"" DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa  tweeted. The other threshold – fundraising – also saw a slight raising of the bar. To make the cut, candidates will have to receive campaign contributions from 165,000 individual donors. That’s up from 130,000 for the September and October debates and from 65,000 for the first two rounds of showdowns. Candidates also will have to receive 600 unique contributions from each of 20 states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories. The DNC’s faced criticism  over its thresholds for months from many of the lower and middle-tier candidates, who argued that the criteria forced them to concentrate on boosting donor contributions at the expense of retail politicking in the early voting states. And, some activists and party leaders in the early voting states have also criticized the DNC for winnowing the record field of candidates – which topped off at roughly two-dozen contenders this summer – before voters actually got to vote in the primaries and caucuses starting this coming February. ""The DNC is using polling to winnow the field even further, when it's voters and caucus-goers who should be determining our nominee,"" said Shannon Beckham, a spokeswoman for Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet's presidential campaign.  And, Galia Slayen, a spokeswoman for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, told Fox News that ""as the DNC continues to make the rules up as they go along, Governor Bullock will remain focused on bringing his message of a fair shot for every American directly to voters on the ground."" Both Bennet and Bullock were on the debate stage in July for the third round but failed to qualify for this month's showdown and it appears unlikely either will make the cut for October's debate. The new thresholds shouldn’t be much of a problem for many of the leading contenders – such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California, as well as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.  2020 DEMOCRATS FUME AT DNC OVER DEBATE THRESHOLDS Some of the other six candidates likely to make the October debate are not sure bets to qualify for November’s showdown. That group consists of Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang. As he has in the past, Yang praised the DNC,  tweeting,  ""Kudos to the DNC for raising the thresholds in a fair and transparent manner as well."" Some of the candidates, including Booker and Buttigieg, quickly used news of the new thresholds to reach out to supporters with fundraising emails. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro and billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer – who've also made the cut for October’s showdown – have yet to hit 3 percent in any polls since the November qualifying period kicked off earlier this month. And, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who's just one poll away from making the October debate, also has yet to reach 3 percent in any approved surveys. A new qualifying poll – a Monmouth University survey in New Hampshire – is set for release on Tuesday."
"But she did not attempt to shield Biden or members of his family from scrutiny as she competes with the former vice president to win the Democratic presidential nomination, though she initially sought to turn attention to Trump's conduct. When asked whether she believed either Biden or his son, Hunter, should be investigated for possible abuse of power, she initially deflected the question by saying, ""Donald Trump is trying to play politics on this issue."" ""He (Trump) is trying to collaborate with -- and conspired with a foreign leader to interfere in our democracy,"" the California senator said during a visit to Oaxacan restaurant in Los Angeles' Koreatown. ""I have absolutely no support for that. And I believe that that this is a political tactic being waged by Donald Trump, because he obviously perceives a threat. That is a political threat, and I have no support for it whatsoever."" There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. But when asked whether she shared the concerns of other Democrats that Biden has too much baggage to be the Democratic nominee for the White House, Harris said, ""I'll leave that to the voters to decide."" ""In my experience, the voters are paying attention to this race, they are paying attention to the issues and people's records,"" Harris said. Still, Harris tried to keep her focus on the current occupant of the White House and her belief that impeachment proceedings should begin now. After visiting with the young second-generation immigrant owners of Guelaguetza, known for its mole and tamales, she pulled out a list of reasons to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump -- ""just to make sure I didn't leave anything out."" ""I strongly believe that it is long past due that we begin impeachment proceedings against this President,"" Harris said. ""He's pressured a foreign leader, the Ukraine President, to dig up dirt on a political opponent, in the 2020 presidential election. He urged a foreign country to attack our democracy in the 2016 presidential election. He gave classified information to Russian officials in May of 2017."" On Friday, CNN reported Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. Trump on Sunday said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Ukraine's President at a time when the country was awaiting a $250 million military aid package from the United States, but he denied doing anything improper. ""The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,"" Trump said.  On Monday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham dismissed Harris' comments on impeachment, telling CNN, ""Another day, another Democrat shouting the word 'impeachment' to anyone who will listen. Nothing new here. "" Harris added that Trump ""undercut the American intelligence community"" in its efforts to deal with North Korea and the American student, Otto F. Warmbier, who was tortured and killed. On her list, she also referenced the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and journalist who wrote for the Washington Post, stating that Trump ""prefers to take the word of Saudi Prince over the word of the American intelligence community"" while adding he also prefers ""taking the word of the Russian President over the word of the American intelligence community when it came to the interference in the 2016 election."" ""He had a national security adviser who secretly worked as a foreign lobbyist and, of course, that was Flynn,"" Harris continued referring to Michael Flynn, Trump's first national security adviser. ""He consistently props up murderous dictators, and again that would be Kim Jong Un, it would be the President of Russia. He has obstructed justice in the investigation into his presidential campaign. And we know that because the Mueller report tells us so -- and gives us 10 examples of just that. He has violated federal law by directing his lawyer to pay $280,000 in hush money to cover up two apparent extramarital affairs -- of course that's the Stormy Daniels case."" Trump has denied having affairs with Daniels and Karen McDougal. She wrapped up the litany of what she views as impeachable offenses by Trump by stating that the President believes he is ""above the law,"" beyond reproach, ""beyond accountability and consequences."" ""It is time that Donald Trump be held accountable for his behaviors that have been essentially against the best interest of the American people and against the best interest of America's democracy,"" she said. She added that she believes that the transcripts between Trump and the Ukrainian President should be released to Congress. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg also weighed in on the controversy on Monday, telling an audience in Dubuque, Iowa, ""We can't go on like this.""  ""We can't have a President admit on national television to trying to involve a foreign government in impacting the American election and accept that as normal,"" he said."
"House Democrats flubbed it the first time by spinning in circles, as Pelosi transparently  slow-played  the Mueller impeachment inquiry (or  non-inquiry ) to its seemingly inevitable whimper of an ending. But there's a valuable lesson to be learned from the Mueller case: Impeachment is a remedy both for criminality and for non-criminal abuse of power. And there looks to be plenty of both in the rapidly-unfolding  Ukraine scandal .   Let's start with potential crimes. Based solely on Trump's  own admissions  and the latest Washington Post reporting -- that Trump  suspended  $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before he spoke with the President of Ukraine about an investigation of alleged wrongdoing by Joe Biden, one of Trump's primary political opponents -- he could have violated any or all of these federal criminal laws.  Trump and his defenders  claim  his motive was to root out corruption generally in Ukraine, and Trump  stated  Tuesday that funds ultimately were paid to Ukraine, though he added, ""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they're not doing it."" But why would Trump be so interested in corruption in Ukraine, if not for the Biden connection?  Has he displayed similar levels of concern for corruption in other foreign countries? Trump  tweeted  that he will release a complete, unredacted transcript of his call with the Ukrainian President on Wednesday. The details of that transcript will be crucial, but Trump's preemptive defense falls flat. First, Trump tweeted that his conversation with the Ukrainian President was ""very friendly."" That's irrelevant. People can be downright chipper while still soliciting bribes and foreign election aid. Trump also claims he exerted ""no pressure"" during the call. Perhaps, but his decision to withhold hundreds of millions in foreign aid from Ukraine just before likely created more pressure than any phone call could. And Trump claimed, ""NO quid pro quo."" But people who commit bribery and extortion rarely state the quid pro quo -- the ""this for that"" exchange -- explicitly. And Trump, by his own  original statement,  made clear he equates ""corruption in Ukraine"" with ""investigate Biden"" and little else: ""All of the corruption taking place was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son."" So, what crimes could Trump be violation of? Foreign election aid  -- as Trump should well know from the Mueller report, it is a crime to ""solicit, accept or receive"" a ""thing of value"" in connection with an election from a foreign national. By his own admission, Trump encouraged (""solicited"") Ukraine to investigate Biden by allegedly dangling hundreds of millions of dollars in recently-suspended foreign aid.   While a criminal investigation does not carry a specific price tag, by any commonsense reading it is a ""thing of value."" And a criminal investigation of Biden would be extraordinarily helpful 2020 campaign fodder for Trump, more valuable than any yard sign or bumper sticker. Why else would Trump and his political flacks, such as personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, be so laser-focused on Biden, of all people -- who currently holds no public office but is a  leading contender  to take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election?   Bribery  -- it is illegal for a public official ""directly or indirectly"" to demand, seek, receive or accept any ""thing of value"" in return for ""being influenced in the performance of any official act."" Here, again, a criminal investigation of Biden should qualify as a ""thing of value"" for the Trump 2020 campaign, which Trump plainly sought from Ukraine. The corresponding ""influence in the performance of an official act"" -- the quid pro quo -- is the delivery of foreign aid to Ukraine. Trump himself  has drawn  that link between foreign aid and Ukraine's efforts to root out ""corruption."" Trump  has made clear  that he equates ""corruption"" with the Biden investigation.  Extortion  is the flip side of the bribery coin. Bribery is essentially ""I'll help you, if you help me,"" while extortion is ""I'll harm you, if you don't help me."" The  suspension  of $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before the call is the proverbial brick thrown through the plate glass window: Here's a taste of what'll happen if you don't comply.   Congress first must determine whether Trump committed a crime. If so, then impeachment is imperative. Even Trump's staunchest defenders would have difficulty arguing that he should remain in the White House if he committed a federal crime while in office. But Congress cannot stop at the criminality question. Because even if Trump's conduct dodges the statutory raindrops and doesn't quite meet the definition of any federal crime, impeachment at its core is a remedy for abuse of constitutional power.  Impeachment  need not  be based on a crime. The Constitution  prescribes  impeachment for ""treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors."" But the term ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" is not defined anywhere in the Constitution or statute, and appears to be  drawn from  English parliamentary practice, which provided for impeachment for crimes or for conduct beyond established criminal law.  The Constitution separates  impeachment  from criminal prosecution. Draft  articles of impeachment  against President Richard Nixon included abuse of power and misuse of public office, while one of the proposed articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton (voted down by the full House) related to  abuse of power  for non-criminal conduct. Fundamentally, impeachment is a political process with a political remedy (removal from office), while criminal charges address violations of law by imposing a punitive remedy (imprisonment and/or a fine). This is where House Democrats have dropped the ball following the Mueller report. Because Mueller did not explicitly find that Trump committed criminal obstruction of justice -- given the Justice Department  policy  against indicting a sitting president -- Congress, reined in by Pelosi, has chosen not to make use of the political side of impeachment except for its minimal, superficial progress on a glacial impeachment inquiry.   Until now, Pelosi has stuck to her commitment not to pursue impeachment, instead offering up limp and hopeless legislative proposals. But Trump's conduct here is so flagrant, so lawless and so abusive that Pelosi   is now changing course on impeachment.   By stepping up and seriously pursuing impeachment, House Democrats can salvage their legacy and  meet their obligation  to defend the Constitution against ""all enemies, foreign and domestic."" Now, your questions Lee, California: Does the House Intel Committee have a legal right to see the intelligence community whistleblower complaint about Trump? On its face, the law  is straightforward . If the Intelligence Community inspector general (IG) receives a complaint and deems it to be (1) of ""urgent concern"" and (2) ""credible,"" then he or she ""shall submit"" the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees. In the Ukraine whistleblower case, the inspector general --  a Trump appointee  -- reviewed the complaint and  found that  it raised an urgent concern and was credible, and should be submitted to Congress.   But that's when the director of National Intelligence (DNI) stepped in. After consulting with Attorney General William Barr's Justice Department, the DNI  concluded  that the IG should not forward the complaint to Congress because the President is not ""a member of the Intelligence Community"" and the conduct did not ""involve an intelligence activity under the DNI's supervision."" In other words, according to the DNI and Justice Department, the law does not apply to the President. That appears to leave the DNI and Justice Department (on one hand) and the IG and Congress (on the other) at an impasse. Acting DNI Joseph Maguire  is scheduled to testify  in the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. While there likely will be plenty of accusations and fireworks, do not expect the DNI and Congress suddenly to reach a mutual resolution. Instead, this dispute seems headed for the courts where, even in the best-case scenario, it will take months to resolve.   That said, there is nothing to prevent Congress from investigating even without the complaint in hand. While the whistleblower complaint could be important to Congress's investigation, Congress need not await the complaint's arrival before taking action.       Yvonne, Arizona: Some of the allegations about both President Donald Trump and Justice Brett Kavanaugh pertain to their conduct before taking office. Can an official be impeached based on conduct that occurred before the person was in office?  Yes. Article 1 of the Constitution  explicitly grants  the House the ""sole power of impeachment"" and the Senate ""the sole power to try all impeachments,"" with no limitation on the time frame of the conduct that can form the basis for impeachment. Typically, where the Constitution contains no explicit limitation on a power, courts are reluctant to read in or impose such a restriction.   In fact, federal officials have been impeached for conduct predating their time in office. Most recently, in 2010, federal judge Thomas Porteus  was impeached and convicted  on various counts, some of which related to his conduct as a state judge (before joining the federal bench) and during his nomination and confirmation process. As a practical matter, it could be more difficult to rally political support for impeachment based on conduct before a subject took office, but legally there is no bar to it.   Craig, Canada: Does Congress have the authority to levy fines on witnesses who refuse to answer questions, like former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski?   As the Trump administration repeatedly contests and defies congressional subpoenas, House Democratic leaders have  openly contemplated  utilizing new enforcement mechanisms, including fines. However, there is no specific law on the books that gives Congress the right to levy fines and, in fact,  nobody has ever been fined  by Congress for defying a subpoena. But constitutional scholar Kia Rahnama  convincingly argues  that Congress's inherent enforcement powers likely include the power to impose fines.   While the current Congress could try to impose fines, there are major practical obstacles to actually collecting. First, there is enough legal uncertainty that the recipient of a fine could contest the issue in courts. It likely would take months to adjudicate the issue. Second, even if Congress did clearly have the power to fine a witness, I'd expect Lewandowski or other Trump loyalists to simply refuse to pay; much as Trump already has announced he will ""fight all the subpoenas,"" he likely would  fight all the fines.  Congress would again have to go to the courts seeking an order requiring the witness to pay up. Essentially, if Congress tried to force Lewandowski to pay a fine, I'd expect him to respond, ""Make me."" Congress ultimately might succeed, but not without a long and bruising legal fight that likely would detract from its core investigative and oversight mission.  Three questions to watch 1) Will Pelosi  finally see the light  and permit her caucus to move forward on impeachment? 2) Will House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff take the intelligence community whistleblower case to court? 3) Will either Trump or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell make the first move to endorse even  a limited gun control legislative package ? "
"Trump, while speaking with reporters before departing the White House for events in Texas and Ohio, continued to defend his July 25 call with  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , but said the 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate was discussed in the exchange. ""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption),"" Trump told reporters. CNN previously reported Trump pressed Zelensky   in the call to investigate  former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according  to a person familiar with the situation .  That call was also part of a  whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump previously branded criticism of the call a ""Ukranian Witch Hunt,"" while Biden accused the President of abusing his power to ""smear"" him. On Sunday, the President said he hopes officials release details of the call, but slammed the whistleblower responsible for filing a complaint. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a strong warning later Sunday to the Trump administration, which has refused to hand over the whistleblower complaint, saying it ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness"" if the resistance persists. The warning, shared in a letter to all House members, comes following a  refusal last week  by acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to turn over the complaint to Congress. In her letter, Pelosi, a California Democrat, said if the administration's refusals continue, it would constitute a ""serious possible breach of constitutional duties by"" Trump and would take Congress ""into a whole new stage of investigation.""  Pelosi set a deadline for Maguire to turn over the full whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee during  his scheduled appearance  Thursday. The Democratic leader's letter threatens investigation at a time when the White House is  already facing House inquiries on multiple fronts  and a continuing  impeachment investigation  by the House Judiciary Committee. The Trump administration has so far split on how to handle the details of the call, but any House-led investigation into the President's Ukraine contact could meet significant resistance from the White House, as it has stonewalled many of the congressional probes already in motion. Pressure to impeach Weighing in on the controversy earlier Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that impeachment ""may be the only remedy"" to Trump's refusal to make public the  complaint  and phone call transcript. ""If the President is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,"" the California Democrat told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" stopping short of  calling on Congress to immediately launch  proceedings. Schiff, who has  so far resisted joining other Democrats  in calling for impeachment, told Tapper he has been ""very reluctant"" to push for proceedings against the President because he sees it as a ""remedy of last resort,"" but also said Sunday that the President doesn't have the authority ""to engage in underhanded discussions."" The chairman's apparent edging toward impeachment follows pressure from others in his party -- including from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- to start proceedings. On Friday, Warren, who is vying for her party's presidential nomination, tweeted that ""Congress is complicit"" in failing to start impeachment proceedings against Trump after news broke that he had allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. Echoing Warren's sentiments, Ocasio-Cortez suggested in a tweet on Saturday that her party's ""refusal to impeach"" Trump was an even bigger scandal than what she said was the President's ""lawbreaking behavior."" Asked by Tapper Sunday about Trump keeping conversations with foreign leaders private, Schiff said: ""Well not if those conversations involve potential corruption or criminality or leverage being used for political advantage against our nation's interest.""  ""This would be, I think, the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during just about any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions,"" he said, adding that he's not certain that the call is the subject of the complaint.  White House split on releasing calls  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told reporters on Saturday that he didn't think Trump had tried pressuring Zelensky during the July call, but stopped short of saying the subject of Biden's son wasn't raised. The President on Sunday described his conversation with the Ukrainian president as ""warm and friendly"" and repeatedly urged reporters to look instead at Biden and Democrats, who he said -- without providing evidence -- have ""done some very bad things."" But while the President suggested he was open to releasing the conversation, telling reporters: ""I hope they can put it out,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there's no evidence such an action ""would be appropriate"" at this time. ""We don't release transcripts very often. It's the rare case,"" Pompeo said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn't be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances. There's no, there's no evidence that would be appropriate here at this point."" Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin also weighed in, telling Tapper Sunday that he thinks releasing the transcript ""would be a terrible precedent,"" arguing that ""conversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential.""  This story has been updated."
"Elizabeth Warren  did not want a goodbye party. She told her aides there would be no grand send-off, no celebration of a mission accomplished. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had been her idea from the start: a new arm of the government, uniquely empowered to police the kinds of loans and financial schemes that led to the Great Recession. Ms. Warren had detailed the idea in a journal article, then cajoled and pressured Congress to make it law. She was tasked by President Barack Obama in 2010 with setting up the bureau, and spent a year recruiting investigators and enforcers for an office they saw as an exhilarating cause. But as spring turned to summer in 2011, Ms. Warren faced a wrenching separation. The White House had decided not to nominate her to lead the bureau permanently. So she gathered the staff for an “all hands” meeting and told them her work there was over. “She told us that we were ready to sail the ship, that we did not need her there, and that we would be able to do it on our own,” said Patricia McCoy, a Boston College law professor who was a senior official at the bureau. Ms. Warren was right. Under her successor, Richard A. Cordray, the bureau would recover $12 billion for consumers from financial institutions by 2017. It would become, to supporters, a prized example of the government taking on big banks after the 2008 financial crisis. To opponents — Republican lawmakers, business associations and a few conservative Democrats — it would become an example of “runaway government,” an agency to be curbed at the first  opportunity . To Ms. Warren, the bureau is something else as well: a formative lesson in how an idea — a plan — can become reality. For it was through creating a new financial regulator that Ms. Warren developed the approach to government that now guides her  presidential campaign . And it was in losing the chance to lead her bureau that Ms. Warren came to see the value of asking voters, rather than a president, to give her power. A review of Ms. Warren’s role in creating the consumer bureau, including interviews with more than 30 people involved in the process, revealed an approach to politics that joins imaginative policy ideas with a keen instinct for mass communication and a willingness to negotiate. On one hand, she marshaled support from progressive activists and helped build public demand for her idea; on the other, she haggled with members of Congress to earn their backing. David Axelrod, who was Mr. Obama’s top political adviser during the battle to create the C.F.P.B., called Ms. Warren’s role a “bona fide credential” for the presidency. “There aren’t that many people who can say they had an idea, wrote about it and ended up bringing it to fruition, in terms of the creation of a whole new government agency with a very focused mission,” Mr. Axelrod said. If some of Ms. Warren’s rivals — and more than a few Democratic voters — question whether her ideas are realistic, she and her supporters answer by pointing to the consumer bureau. At the New Hampshire Democratic Party’s convention this month, supporters of Ms. Warren broke out in chants of, “C-F-P-B! She fights for you, she fights for me!” In a recent interview, Ms. Warren described the creation of the bureau as a “model” for how she would seek to deploy her plans as president. At  a September rally  in Washington Square Park in New York, Ms. Warren likened herself to Frances Perkins, the first secretary of labor — a woman, she said, “who worked the political system relentlessly from the inside, while a sustained movement applied pressure from the outside.” But if the bureau has been an enduring victory for Ms. Warren, it culminated in a painful disappointment.  In the interview, Ms. Warren — an upbeat presence on the campaign trail — became somber when the conversation turned to her exit from the bureau. Asked about her insistence against having a farewell party, her eyes began to  glisten .  “I couldn’t say goodbye to all those people I’d hired and all those people I’d brought in to fight,” Ms. Warren said, speaking slowly and quietly. “I’d made an implicit promise to lead the charge, and I would’ve stayed and led it if I could have. But I couldn’t. And I did not want to say goodbye to all of them.” Ms. Warren’s band of advisers, lawyers, researchers and technicians devised a more discreet send-off. Elizabeth Vale, a former White House official who was among Ms. Warren’s close counselors, said an immense farewell card was made from a “big, big, big piece of cardboard,” stamped with the electric-green logo of the C.F.P.B. and signed by scores of staff members. Still, Ms. Warren, then 62, declined to receive it before a throng of colleagues. “I remember two of us brought it to her,” Ms. Vale said, “and then I remember when she walked out, she just walked out quietly, by herself.” An Idea About Exploding Toasters It all began with Ms. Warren’s decision to write an article in the winter of 2007. She had endured one unhappy brush with Washington, testifying against a bill to tighten the bankruptcy code in a way she feared would burden low-income debtors. The proposal became law in 2005, with Joseph R. Biden Jr., then a senator, as its leading Democratic supporter. Back at Harvard,  where she was teaching law, Ms. Warren began considering a new idea: a proposal for a government regulator to address the issue on which Congress had spurned her advice — the problem of consumer credit and the often-deceptive financial products being offered to ordinary people. She outlined the concept to Kenneth Baer, then 34, a former Clinton administration aide who with several like-minded Democrats had founded a publication, Democracy, to stir an ambitious policy debate among liberals. He was skeptical at first of Ms. Warren’s regulatory proposal, wondering if forming a new government agency represented an “old Democratic way of thinking.” But Mr. Baer and his colleagues were hungry for big ideas to fill what they saw as an intellectual void in the Democratic Party, and he encouraged her to make the case for a new regulator. In a February email to Mr. Baer, Ms. Warren agreed to write it. As she tells it now, she was bursting for the chance. “The idea was ripe,” she said. “I was ready.” A draft of the piece followed in late March. Ms. Warren urged her collaborators to “edit aggressively,” an instruction that proved unnecessary. A copy of her first version reviewed by a reporter shows its now-famous opening was scarcely  changed . “In the U.S. today it is not possible to buy a toaster that has a 1-in-5 chance of bursting into flames and burning down a customer’s house,” Ms. Warren wrote in her draft. “But it is possible to refinance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same 1-in-5 chance of putting the family out on the street — without ever disclosing that  fac t to the homeowner.” When Democracy published Ms. Warren’s article in the summer of 2007, Mr. Baer and his colleagues promoted it — and its author — vigorously, booking Ms. Warren on CNN and winning coverage for her idea in national newspapers. And they promoted it to presidential campaigns, too. A breakthrough came in June when Heather McGhee, a policy adviser to Senator John Edwards, emailed Ms. Warren to say her candidate was about to endorse a new regulator for financial products. By early 2008, Ms. Warren and her sometime editors were musing over email that the proposal could really become law. When Ms. Warren noted praise for her idea in Newsweek, Andrei Cherny, a co-founder of Democracy, wrote back, “Next stop: law of the land!” “I’m working on it!” Ms. Warren replied, signing off with her initials, EW, in lowercase. It had been decades since either political party had tried seriously to impose tougher financial regulations. Even sympathetic Democrats, like Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, questioned the feasibility. Ms. McGhee, who stayed in touch with Ms. Warren after the Edwards campaign ended, said she saw the professor straining to discern what to do and whom to turn to in Washington. “She really was trying to figure out how to have all the right conversations,” Ms. McGhee said. “And then the financial crisis happened.” A Two-Sided Game The Congressional Oversight Panel, a body set up to scrutinize Washington’s bailout of the financial system, did not mention toasters in its “special report” on financial regulation. But the document, issued days after Mr. Obama’s inauguration in 2009, was unmistakable in its suggestion. The report recommended creating a financial regulator that could gather up the fragmented enforcement tools of the federal government and seek to avert another financial crisis. It was a natural suggestion for the oversight body, since Ms. Warren was its chairwoman.  Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader at the time, had named her to the post at the end of 2008, in the throes of a global financial catastrophe that sent unemployment soaring and threw millions of homeowners into foreclosure. From this perch, Ms. Warren began a campaign for her bureau. It was no longer a lonely effort. Mr. Frank, a powerful committee chairman, was now an ally. So was an emerging coalition of progressive groups, labor unions and consumer advocates, known as Americans for Financial Reform. Ms. Warren sought out its leader, Heather Booth, for insight into political organizing. “She knew many of the players on the policy side,” Ms. Booth said. “What she hadn’t been experienced with were the politics.” Ms. Warren also built alliances inside government, finding friends in people like Mr. Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett, one of Mr. Obama’s closest advisers. Mr. Axelrod saw the bureau as a political necessity, the one part of financial reform ordinary voters might understand. At times, Ms. Warren’s appeals were strikingly personal: Over dinner in Cambridge, Mass., Ms. Warren told Ms. Jarrett much of the life story that is now familiar to voters who follow her campaign, a tale of deep economic adversity for her family in Oklahoma. “It put in context why this policy was so important to her,” Ms. Jarrett said. Mr. Obama embraced the proposal, putting a consumer bureau in his blueprint for financial reform in the spring of 2009 and talking on late-night television about exploding toasters. Ms. Warren was elated but uneasy. The financial industry was mobilizing, warning that a new regulator would damage the economic recovery. And Ms. Warren was concerned about two of Mr. Obama’s lieutenants: Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, who helmed the National Economic Council. She had profound philosophical disagreements with both men, who believed that her savage criticism of the bank bailouts revealed a misunderstanding of the role of Wall Street in the fragile economic recovery. “Tim and Larry were not fans of this agency,” Ms. Warren said. “I heard more than once from Senate and House staffers that they had proposed scrapping it in return for some other concession that they cared more about.” Of Mr. Obama, she said: “I never worried about the president. I was worried about his advisers.” Mr. Obama remained forcefully supportive and senior officials at the Treasury Department helped negotiate the shape of the bureau at every stage. In the House, Ms. Warren blessed deals struck by Mr. Frank, including one exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from certain new regulatory requirements. The concession was intended to win over an influential trade group, the Independent Community Bankers of America, and its chief lobbyist, Cam Fine. The arrangement dismayed the left — until Ms. Warren endorsed it. “She was very realistic,” Mr. Frank said. “She was deeply engaged in talking to members and she did acquire her own sense of what was politically doable.” Ms. Warren had less influence in the Senate, where Democrats held the majority but their ability to break a filibuster hinged on centrist legislators. So Ms. Warren turned her attention beyond the chamber, rallying activists and talking to the media. In her most provocative move,  she told HuffPost  that the Senate must either create a “strong consumer agency” or have “no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor.” “That,” Ms. Warren said recently, “is the outsider’s game.” The Senate ultimately approved a bureau that was stronger in some ways than Ms. Warren’s 2007 proposal. Instead of a Financial Products Safety Commission, led by committee, it would be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, headed by a single director. And it would draw funding from the Federal Reserve, putting its budget beyond reach of adversaries in Congress. Ms. Warren attended the July 2010 ceremony where Mr. Obama signed the Dodd-Frank bill into law, and with it a consumer bureau that he asked her to help set up. He designated her an aide to himself and to Mr. Geithner, with a mandate to build the regulator she had devised on paper in 2007. There was no promise she would become the permanent director. If Ms. Warren had won a landmark policy victory, it came at the cost of making enemies in Congress and the administration. While Mr. Geithner would criticize business groups for opposing the consumer bureau in a 2014 book, he also cast Ms. Warren as an implacable critic of the bank rescue, more focused on “made-for-YouTube” grandstanding than on crafting practical ideas. He and Mr. Summers described her in White House meetings as unreasonably hostile to financial institutions, and as simply unreasonable. “You cannot play the role she was playing without making people mad at you,” said former Representative Brad Miller, a North Carolina Democrat involved in drafting Dodd-Frank. He said of the Obama economic team, “Those were folks who were used to getting their own way and not having to deal with critics at all.” Mr. Geithner, now president of the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed. Mr. Summers, who has criticized some of Ms. Warren’s 2020 campaign proposals, did not respond to interview requests. But Ms. Warren at times unnerved others in the administration. In a 2015 memoir, Mr. Axelrod wrote that Mr. Obama grew frustrated in 2010 with Ms. Warren’s assertive efforts to position herself to become director — a possibility he feared would enrage banks and doom the Dodd-Frank bill. “Tell her to keep her mouth shut,” Mr. Obama said, according to Mr. Axelrod’s book. “She may well be the choice, but we can’t surface that now.” ‘That Was Her Job’ In the spring of 2011, Mr. Fine, the lobbyist for community banks, got a call from Ms. Jarrett. If the White House selected Ms. Warren to lead the consumer bureau, she asked, would he fight for her confirmation? Mr. Fine said he would. A few days later, Ms. Warren told Mr. Fine over lunch in downtown Washington that the White House had decided against nominating her. “I said: ‘That’s just not right. Do you want me to start a campaign? Do you want me to demand a meeting over at the White House?’” said Mr. Fine, whose offers Ms. Warren declined. “She put on a brave face.” For Ms. Warren, this setback came at the end of a whirlwind year setting up the bureau. Since Dodd-Frank became law, Ms. Warren had traveled widely and hired aggressively. Eager to show her organization was at work, she demanded swift, visible actions, like the creation of a complaint hotline with a public catalog of Americans’ grievances against banks and other lenders. Her recruitment efforts had established the bureau as a political force, as well as a legal one. The staff swelled, and weekly meetings shifted from a modest conference room to an elevator-studded lobby. In a pair of public-relations coups, Ms. Warren asked Holly Petraeus, a Better Business Bureau official married to a renowned general, to lead the Office of Servicemember Affairs, and enlisted Mr. Cordray, the outgoing attorney general of Ohio, to lead her enforcement division.  “As she put it to me: It’s a chance to do on a nationwide basis what you’re doing in Ohio, with more tools, more authority to pursue the banks,” Mr. Cordray said, recalling Ms. Warren’s pitch. It was a chance, in other words, to wield great power. But Ms. Warren would soon learn that hers was borrowed power — power delegated by the president, and for only a year. By the spring of 2011, the opposition to Ms. Warren becoming permanent director was unbending. Republican senators said they would never confirm her; so did Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, a conservative Democrat. Mr. Nelson, who is supporting Mr. Biden in the Democratic primary, said in an interview that he worried about empowering someone he saw as a champion of “runaway government.” “I was very concerned about somebody who had been such a strong advocate for a government bureau that had virtually no control,” Mr. Nelson said. Mr. Reid said Republican opposition sealed Ms. Warren’s fate. “The Republicans stopped her from getting that job,” he said. “That was her job.” Among some of Ms. Warren’s allies, frustration lingers about what happened in 2011. They blame not just Republicans, but also her rivals in the Obama administration and a harsh strain of sexism directed at her by political opponents and the media. “Men never get this adjective, ‘strident.’ That bothers me, because I don’t think she is,” Ms. Petraeus said. “Yes, she’s passionate. She doesn’t hesitate to call somebody out, especially on the Hill, if they’re trying to serve up a bunch of double-dealing nonsense.” Sheila Bair, a Warren ally who was then at the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,  said she had been angry to learn the White House was leaning against nominating Ms. Warren. Her detractors in the administration, Ms. Bair said, had been “whispering behind the scenes that she couldn’t get confirmed.” “Even if that is true, fight it out,” Ms. Bair said. In the end, Mr. Obama concluded Mr. Cordray stood a better chance of clearing the Senate. Republicans would stonewall his nomination until 2013. It was Ms. Jarrett who called to inform Ms. Warren. She also suggested an alternative path forward: running for Senate. “She was not overly enthusiastic in our first call, because she never saw herself as a politician,” Ms. Jarrett said, “and I said I thought that’s the reason she’d be perfect for the job.” Others in the administration, including Mr. Geithner’s aides, saw the Senate race as a way to get Ms. Warren out of the executive branch. Mr. Miller, the former congressman, said he emailed Ms. Warren to warn that her critics might be trying to lure her “into a race that she could not win.” But in September 2011, Ms. Warren entered the race against Senator Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts, starting down a path that has led with improbable speed to a presidential campaign. Her candidacy today resembles a vastly enlarged version of the movement that gave rise to the consumer bureau. In a campaign framed as a crusade of ideas, Ms. Warren has vowed to restructure the economy as president using the same methods that helped make her imagined agency a real structure of concrete and glass. It is not lost on Ms. Warren that, had she become the director, it is unlikely she would be a leading presidential candidate now. “I would have stayed,” she said, “and done it forever.”"
"The president defends his conversations with world leaders and blasts Joe Biden's 'disgraceful' statement on Ukraine during an Oval Office meeting with Australian PM Scott Morrison. The developing controversy over a mysterious phone conversation  President Trump  had with a foreign leader apparently centers on Ukraine, as the president and his allies fight back and claim the uproar is just another ""partisan"" plot against him. What touched off the  controversy is a secret  whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM   Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, seemed to acknowledge some effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate potential corruption related to the Biden family, though he gave conflicting answers on the matter in a CNN interview overnight. It remains unclear what the supposed ""promise"" from Trump entailed. The president, however, maintained he said nothing improper, tearing into those pushing the allegations Friday. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, alongside visiting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the president blasted the “ridiculous” story, blaming a “partisan whistleblower” and calling it “just another political hack job.” “I don’t know the identity of the whistleblower,” Trump said. He wouldn’t say what was discussed in the call but said someone should “look into” Biden family connections to Ukraine. He also argued the press has had “a bad week,” insisting he has prevailed in controversies reported by the media. “I guess I’m about 22 and 0, and I’ll keep it that way,” the president said. Afterward, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democratic committee leaders issued a statement demanding the administration hand over the complaint. “President Trump just went on national television—from the Oval Office—and personally attacked an Intelligence Community whistleblower who reported an urgent matter involving serious or flagrant misconduct,"" they said, adding that the ""brazen effort to intimidate this whistleblower risks a chilling effect on future whistleblowers."" Earlier Friday, Trump sounded off on Twitter, accusing Schiff of joining with the media to go after him once again. “The Radical Left Democrats and their Fake News Media partners, headed up again by Little Adam Schiff, and batting Zero for 21 against me, are at it again!” the president tweeted Friday. “They think I may have had a ‘dicey’ conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a ‘highly partisan’ whistleblowers statement.” He added: “Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!” For his part, Schiff told reporters Friday that the whistleblower claim ""deserves a thorough investigation."" ""Come hell or high water that’s what we’re going to do,” he said. Meanwhile, allies of the president took to the airwaves to downplay the story ""This is a clear example of someone from the deep state ... from the intelligence community,"" former  Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said on Fox News’  ""The Story with Martha MacCallum."" ""It was completely overblown. ... It will be a big nothing burger."" Fueling intrigue, Giuliani has raised questions about the activities of former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into that company. During an interview Thursday on CNN, Giuliani was asked whether he had asked Ukraine to look into Biden. Giuliani initially said, ""No, actually I didn't,"" but seconds later he said, ""Of course I did."" He explained that he sought for the government to look into how the case was dismissed. Later, Giuliani tweeted, ""A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job."" MATTHEW WHITAKER CALLS REPORTED WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT A 'CLEAR EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE FROM THE DEEP STATE' The whistleblower complaint has triggered a major showdown with Congress, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would not share details of it with lawmakers. The inspector general for the intelligence community received the complaint and, according to correspondence with Schiff, considered the allegations “credible” and dealing with an “urgent concern.” But the watchdog reported to the committee that his office is “at an impasse” with the director of national intelligence over the disclosure. Inspector General Michael Atkinson wrote that the DNI, “after consulting with the Department of Justice,” determined the complaint does not have to be shared with the intelligence committees under law. He wrote that he will “abide by that determination,” but disagrees with it. After a closed-door hearing Thursday with Atkinson, Schiff voiced concerns about not having access to the information, warning Congress could use legal action or budgetary powers as leverage. ""What’s at stake here goes well beyond this complaint and this president,"" he said. Schiff had subpoenaed Maguire saying he was withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioning whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a letter Tuesday, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of ""urgent concern."" He said the complaint ""concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision."" Schiff said last week that Maguire is required to share the complaint with Congress and said the attempt to hold it back ""raises serious concerns about whether White House, Department of Justice or other executive branch officials are trying to prevent a legitimate whistleblower complaint from reaching its intended recipient, the Congress, in order to cover up serious misconduct."" Following Thursday’s Atkinson hearing, Maguire is still expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26.

"Power Player of the Week: Academy Award-winner Denzel Washington is a national spokesman for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. This is a rush transcript from ""Fox News Sunday,"" September 22, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JOHN ROBERTS, ANCHOR: I'm John Roberts in for Chris Wallace. Tension between United States and Iran to boil over as world leaders prepare to meet at the United Nations. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: These are the highest sanctions ever imposed on a country. We've never done it to this level. ROBERTS: The United States continues its campaign of maximum pressure on the Islamic regime and -- MARK ESPER, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: The president has approved the deployment of U.S. forces, which will be defensive in nature. ROBERTS: Points the finger at Tehran for those Saudi oil attacks. MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We know precisely who conducted these attacks, it was Iran. ROBERTS: We'll ask Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the options on the table live only on ""FOX News Sunday"". Then, we'll get reaction from Democrat Ben Cardin, a key member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It's a ""FOX News Sunday"" exclusive. Plus, reports the president had an inappropriate phone call with the president of Ukraine. REPORTER: Did you discuss Joe Biden, his son, or his family? TRUMP: It doesn't matter what I discussed. It's a partisan whistle- blower. JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know I'm up against it. A serial abuser. That's what this guy is. He abuses power everywhere he can. ROBERTS: We'll discuss with President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Plus, ask or send a panel how the growing controversy is fueling impeachment talks. All right now on ""FOX News Sunday"". (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: And hello again from FOX News in Washington. The war of words over the Saudi oil attacks, which the United States blames on Iran, has turned into action, the Pentagon announcing it will send more troops to the region to boost security for allies and President Trump approving new sanctions on Iran's central bank. But the president also signaling he is not inclined to authorize an immediate military strike, which the Iranian regime has declared would mean all-out war. In a moment, we'll speak with the president's top diplomat, Mike Pompeo, who just returned from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. But first, Kevin Corke is traveling with the president, who has a rally today in Houston with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Kevin, good morning. KEVIN CORKE, CORRESPONDENT: John, good day to be with you. Right. We'll have more on that rally coming up in just a few moments, but by any measure, John, the Iranians are suffering greatly under this latest round of U.S. sanctions, just one of many weapons in the U.S. arsenal as it considers what to do next about Iran's Saudi attack. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: We have just sanction the Iranian national bank. It's going to be at the highest level of sanctions. CORKE: We'll see what happens, a familiar refrain from President Trump. When asked with the U.S. might do next to respond to Iran's attacks on Saudi oil fields. Iran denies it was behind those attacks. In addition to more sanctions, the president has authorized sending a battery of U.S. forces to the region at Saudi request. ESPER: As the president has made clear, the United States does not seek conflict with Iran. That said, we have many other military options available should they be necessary. CORKE: The strikes, which Washington says it can prove came from Iran, have pushed the regent to the brink. For its part, Tehran is threatening to escalate the violence should the U.S. or the Saudis attack even in limited form. MAJOR GENERAL HOSSEIN SALAMI, IRAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD COMMANDER: A limited invasion will not remain limited. We hand down and punish. We have proven it before. CORKE: That warning comes under day that saw the regime put its military capabilities on display, with a series of parades to mark the 39th anniversary of the start of the Iran-Iraq war and comes months after the Iranians downed and a American surveillance drone in international airspace. This in a week that will see a gathering of world leaders at United Nations General Assembly in New York where Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says he'll present a Gulf security plan. (END VIDEOTAPE) CORKE: All this as the U.S. welcomes another world leader. This time it's Narendra Modi, as you mentioned, the prime minister of India. He's here for a ""Howdy, Modi"" Texas rally with President Trump. It is set to be the largest American audience to see a foreign leader speak other than the pope. We'll bring it to you throughout the day. But for now, thank you. ROBERTS: OK, Kevin Corke, thanks very much. The president with an afternoon event with Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia as well. Kevin, we'll see you soon. Thanks. Joining me now from New York is the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday"". POMPEO: John, it's great to be with you. ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, earlier in the week, you said of the attack against the Saudi oil facilities that it was, quote, an act of war, and you said that Iran was definitely behind it. When you say something is an act of war, does that demand ultimately a military response? POMPEO: Well, John, our mission set has been very clear. President Trump would like to have a diplomatic solution, that's the task that's in front of us. That's what we've been aiming for for a little over two years now with the strongest sanctions that have ever been put in place against this revolutionary regime. And, John, you know the history. Forty years of terror from Iran. It's an anti-Semitic set of leaders that would like to wipe Israel and America from the face of the earth. Our mission set is to avoid war. You saw what Secretary Esper announced on Friday, we're putting additional forces in the region for the purpose of deterrence and defense, with our objective to be very clear, to support the Iranian people so that they can get this regime to cease behaving in a way that is so destructive not only to their own country, but to the entire Middle East. ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, there are reports this morning that Houthi militants in Yemen have warned both Saudi Arabia and the United States that Iran may be planning another attack in Saudi Arabia. Is that true? POMPEO: So, I've certainly seen that reporting and I won't talk about American intelligence and what we know. But suffice it to say, we are consistently concerned that Iran will continue to behave in the way that it has now for 40 years, it did so before the JCPOA, it did so during the JCPOA, and they continue to act in ways that are inconsistent with our obligations. I'm here this week at the United Nations. I traveled to Jeddah and to Abu Dhabi this week. The whole world understands that Iran is the bad actor. They are the evil force in the region. They are destabilizing in the Middle East, and I hope this week here in New York, the whole world will come together to push back against this and convince the Iranian leadership that this behavior is simply unacceptable. ROBERTS: That may be a tough hill to climb though, yes? POMPEO: I think there's a handful of countries that are actually supportive of Iran and what Iran is doing are certainly unwilling to push back. But it's the case; this is the world's responsibility to respond from these state-on-state acts of war that took place in Saudi Arabia this past week. ROBERTS: If Iran were to launch, in the middle of all of this, another attack against Saudi Arabia, would the United States have any other option but to respond militarily? POMPEO: John, unlike the previous administration, we try -- we do our best to avoid talking about what we will do, but the American people should know, just like the Iranian people should know, America is prepared to respond in ways that are consistent with America's national security interests. Our first aim, of course, is to keep the American people safe and secure, and part of that is to make sure that we have all the things in place so that we can do that. ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, many military and foreign policy experts, even members of the president's own support group, believe that in calling off the retaliatory strike in response to that drone shoot-down at the last minute, the president signaled to Iran that there are no consequences for its malign activities. What do you say to that criticism? POMPEO: Well, first of all, there have been consequences, real consequences. The Iranian economy will shrink by between 10 and 15 percent in the year in front of us, and we took a handful of actions, some of which I can't talk about here. So there were certainly consequences. The Iranians aren't looking for a green light. The Iranians have behaved poorly for 40 years. And so, it's not the case that any particular response has allowed the Iranians to think they have freedom to move about the cabin (ph). I assure you of this: the Iranian leadership understands four-square that President Trump will take appropriate action and impose appropriate costs on Iran if they continue to act in the way that they've done over these past now 40 years. ROBERTS: You mentioned, Mr. Secretary, at the beginning of this, the sanctions that President Trump put on Iran. On Friday, he said that there were sanctions at the highest level. If these sanctions don't work, what's next? What's left? POMPEO: Well, they are working, John. The toughest of the sanctions, the essential ban on the -- Iran's ability to sell its crude oil around the world took effect only -- (CROSSTALK) POMPEO: -- in May of this year. ROBERTS: But what I mean is if they don't work -- if they don't work to bring Iran to the table. POMPEO: As Secretary Esper said on Friday night, we're prepared to act in ways that are necessary in order to achieve the outcome President Trump has very clearly laid out. I talked about it a year ago, in May. We know what the objectives are. We simply want Iran to behave like a normal nation. ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, is it possible that if there were a retaliatory military strike against Iran, that it would be able to be contained, or would it, as Javad Zarif and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Council have warned, erupt into all-out conflagration in the Middle East, which would likely involve U.S. bases in the region, would likely also possibly involve Israel? POMPEO: We're certainly deeply aware of the risks. That's why we want to resolve this in a way that doesn't resort to kinetic action, if it's at all possible to achieve that. But as for Zarif, I don't know why nobody listens to him. He has nothing to do with Iranian foreign policy. He lies all the time. We need to make sure that we do the right things to protect and secure America and do our best to provide the resources to the Emirates and the Saudis, who I had a chance to speak to this week on my trip, so that they have increased capability to defend themselves and their own people. And when we -- when we do those things, I'm confident that we will have set the conditions for deterrence. And if that deterrence should continue to fail, I'm also confident President Trump will take the actions that are necessary. ROBERTS: All right. We will see what happens at the United Nations General Assembly this week. I'll see you there later on today. Let's switch to this whistleblower complaint. We still don't know the exact substance of the complaint but it does seem to revolve around a July 25th conversation the president had with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And we have heard from reporting in ""The Wall Street Journal"" that the president asked Zelensky about eight times to have the Ukraine work with his attorney Rudy Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's involvement in Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. To your mind, is that an appropriate conversation for Rudy Giuliani to be having with Ukrainian officials? POMPEO: Well, John, you're asking me to comment on an I.C. (ph) report I haven't seen and some reporting -- I have no idea if that has any foundation whatsoever. As for appropriate action, I've watched the president engage with the Ukrainian leadership. I listened to conversations. I remember the previous administration refusing to send defensive weapon systems to Ukraine. This president has chosen to do that not once, not twice, but now three times, so that the Ukraine people could fight back against the overtaking of southeast Ukraine. You remember, it was the previous administration that allowed Vladimir Putin to take one fifth of the Ukrainian country. We're going to see President Zelensky this week. I do hope -- I do hope that if Vice President Biden engaged in behavior that was inappropriate, if he had a conflict of interest or entered (ph) -- or allowed something to take place in Ukraine which may have interfered in our elections in 2016, I do hope that we get to the bottom of that. ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, you said that you have not seen the complaint, not many people have. I assume, though, that you have seen a transcript of the telephone call that the president had with Zelensky. Should a transcript of that be released to clear the air? POMPEO: I'll ultimately leave that to the White House. But you know, John, those are private conversations between world leaders, and it's -- it's not often that those are released. And when they're done, it's done when the White House deems it appropriate. And I'll leave whether that should be released to them. ROBERTS: Again, I assume that you've seen the transcript. Is it as described in ""The Wall Street Journal""? POMPEO: You know, I haven't seen ""The Wall Street Journal"" piece, John. There's a lot going on in the world. ROBERTS: Right. The whistleblower complaint reportedly alleges a quid pro quo or a promise made to a foreign leader. ""The Wall Street Journal"" reports there was no evidence of a quid pro quo in that call with Zelensky. Was there a quid pro quo -- was there a request to investigate Biden and/or his son? And was that linked to a promise of aid? POMPEO: John, I've watched this president evaluate how and when and to the extent we should provide support to Ukraine, both defense assistance and other foreign assistance, we've been at the center of that. Those conversations have always been 100 percent appropriate, 100 percent lawful, and 100 percent ensuring that the American taxpayers were protected, that we put those resources to good use and we've got good outcomes in Ukraine when we used American taxpayer dollars to support the Ukrainian leadership -- every single time, John. ROBERTS: If there was a quid pro quo, would that be a problem? POMPEO: John, you're asking me to provide legal analysis on a hypothetical on a report I haven't seen. Come on. ROBERTS: I mean, if an American leader says to a foreign leader, we will do this and it might have something to do with USA, in exchange for this, is that a problem? POMPEO: John, it's the case we have foreign assistance that is evaluated against American objectives consistently. It's my duty to protect America by making sure that when foreign assistance is provided to countries, that America benefit from that. And it's completely appropriate to make sure that American taxpayer dollars are used appropriately. ROBERTS: Do believe that there should be an investigation into Hunter Biden's involvement with the Ukrainian gas company? POMPEO: I'll leave that to others, but I certainly think it's appropriate if there's concerns and there's enough information to justify looking into it. The American people deserve to know if that was handled in an appropriate way by Vice President Biden. ROBERTS: Just before we go, Mr. Secretary, are you ruling out a run for the Senate from Kansas next year? POMPEO: I've said the same thing, John, for a long time. As long as President Trump is going to have me as secretary of state, which I hope is a long time, that's what I'm going to continue to do. ROBERTS: I'm sure he wants you as secretary of state for a long time. I'm just wondering if you still have aspirations for the Senate. POMPEO: It's what I want to do, too. I want to be President Trump's secretary of state. ROBERTS: All right. Secretary Pompeo, we'll see you later on in New York. POMPEO: Thank you, sir. ROBERTS: Thanks for joining us. We'll be following all the action, of course, at the United Nations General Assembly next week. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: Interactions between President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and the president of Ukraine are under scrutiny following reports of a whistle- blower complaint, claiming that the president urged the Ukrainian to investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, potentially influencing the 2020 race. Joining me here live in Washington to talk more about this is Mr. Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Rudy, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday."" RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How are you? How are you, John? ROBERTS: I'm good. Thanks for joining us. Let's clear something up, first of all. GIULIANI: Sure. ROBERTS: Let's dial the clock back to Thursday, play this exchange between you and Chris Cuomo on CNN, in which you appeared to at first say you didn't ask Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and/or his son, and then you seemed to change her mind. GIULIANI: Right. ROBERTS: Listen. Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CUOMO, CNN: Did you to ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden? GIULIANI: No. Actually, I didn't. CUOMO: You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden... GIULIANI: The only thing I asked about Joe Biden... CUOMO: ... and his role with the prosecutor? GIULIANI: ... is to get to the bottom of how it was that Lutsenko, who was appointed... CUOMO: Right. GIULIANI: ... dismissed the case against AntAC. CUOMO: So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden? GIULIANI: Of course I did. CUOMO: You just said you didn't. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: All right, so which is it? Did you ask the Ukraine -- did you ask the Ukraine -- did you ask Ukraine to look into it or not? (CROSSTALK) GIULIANI: I clarified it immediately. ROBERTS: All right. GIULIANI: He said to me, did you ever talk about Joe Biden? I said no. Then I said, I did say that you should investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. The no was obviously wrong. I corrected it immediately. ROBERTS: GIULIANI: I corrected it before he corrected it. The reality is, the distinction is this. What they are trying to say is, I went there for a political mission to kind of get Joe Biden in trouble. Ridiculous. I went there as a lawyer defending his client. I -- I have known about this for five months. I have been trying to get people to cover this for five months. So, I knew it would be very, very hard to get this out. And what I'm talking about, this, it's Ukrainian collusion, which was large, significant, and proven with Hillary Clinton, with the Democratic National Committee, a woman named Chalupa, with the ambassador, with an FBI agent who's now been hired by George Soros who was funding a lot of it. When Biden got the prosecutor fired, the new prosecutor, who Biden approved -- you don't get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country, unless something fishy is going on. The new prosecutor dropped the case, not just on Biden's kid and the crooked company that Biden's kid work for, Burisma. That was done as a matter of record in October of 2016, after the guy got tanked. He also dropped the case on George Soros' company called AntAC. AntAC is the company where there's documentary evidence that they were producing false information about Trump, about Biden. Fusion GPS was there. Go back and listen to Nellie Ohr's testimony. Nellie Ohr says that there was a lot of contract between Democrats and the Ukraine. Well, I have all the contacts. And, John, when the rest of this comes out, and when you look at China and the $1.5 billion that the -- that the Biden family took out of China while that guy was negotiating for us, this will be a lot bigger than Spiro Agnew. They have fallen into a trap. ROBERTS: So, you went over there to investigate alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election? GIULIANI: Yes. And if I can't do that, I can't defend a client. I... ROBERTS: All right, so when did this morph into an investigation of Joe Biden and Hunter Biden? And is it appropriate for you, as a representative of the president, to be going to Ukraine and finding dirt on Joe Biden and/or his son to use politically in 2020? GIULIANI: Well, that's the way you characterize it. It's certainly appropriate... ROBERTS: That's the way it appears to line up. GIULIANI: No, it doesn't. ROBERTS: You went there for one thing, you found out something else, and that's what you have been digging on this. (CROSSTALK) GIULIANI: That's the way the pro-Biden media lines it up. This began with someone coming to me saying, this information can clear your client about the corruption in Ukraine between the Ukraine, the Democratic Party, the ambassador, and the FBI agent who investigated the case. (CROSSTALK) ROBERTS: But it then -- but then it morphs into Biden. GIULIANI: And -- inextricably combined, because Biden had the guy fired, Shokin. By the way, his statement is on record. The lazy press could go read it. They don't have to listen to me. There are three videotapes of prosecutors on record, available on here, that nobody has covered for five months, because this town protects Joe Biden. His family has been taking money from his public office for years, $1.5 billion from China, when our vice president is supposed to be impartially and independently negotiating for us? And the kid, he takes him on Air Force Two to China, and the kid... ROBERTS: That was in 2013. GIULIANI: Yes. And the kid, unfortunately, is a drug addict. China didn't give $1.5 billion to his kid, Biden's kid, a recovering drug addict, Kerry's stepson, and Whitey Bulger's nephew. Ladies and gentlemen, go look at what the press has been covering up on you. Can you imagine... ROBERTS: This is a company called Rosemont Seneca. Let me just -- let me just come back, if I could. GIULIANI: You got to stop for a second. Whitey Bulger's nephew? ROBERTS: Let me just stop for a second. GIULIANI: One-point-five billion coming from China, when our vice president... (LAUGHTER) ROBERTS: Mr. Mayor... GIULIANI: That doesn't shock you? ROBERTS: ... let me stop for a second, because... GIULIANI: I mean, how far have we deteriorated? ROBERTS: Let me stop for a second, because we are throwing around a lot of Ukrainian names that people don't know about. GIULIANI: Well, that's because nobody would ever cover this. ROBERTS: Viktor Shokin was a prosecutor back when Biden was the vice president. He was looking into Burisma Holdings... GIULIANI: Right. ROBERTS: ... of which Hunter Biden was on the board of directors. GIULIANI: Correct. ROBERTS: There were some allegations that there was some monkey business going on with Burisma. (LAUGHTER) ROBERTS: Joe Biden -- Joe Biden -- Joe Biden went over to Ukraine in 2016... GIULIANI: Right. ROBERTS: ... and said that, I'm going to withhold more than a billion dollars in loan guarantees unless you fire this prosecutor. Joe Biden talked about that in 2018. Let's roll that. GIULIANI: Right. (LAUGHTER) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars. I said, you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here. And I think it was, what, six hours. I look at it. I said, we're leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: But Shokin had been heavily criticized for corruption. And it was the United States and a number of other Western countries who said... GIULIANI: So is everybody in the Ukraine. ROBERTS: ... he needs to go. GIULIANI: More relevant... ROBERTS: So, was this tied to Hunter Biden, or was this the United States saying, you have got a bad actor there, because he was accused of corruption in his office? And other countries in the West were saying he needs to go as well. GIULIANI: What does it matter, if the -- if the son is under investigation? He didn't disclose that. Doesn't the thing strike you? I mean, it is so warped. Doesn't it strike you as strange that he would tell that story and not mention to you that his son's company was the major defendant in the investigation, the guy who was carrying on? Do you -- I happen to know -- and I have seen the records -- do you know why he was fired? Do you know how the kid was paid? Three million dollars goes from Ukraine to Cyprus -- I'm sorry -- Ukraine to Latvia, Latvia to Cyprus, Cyprus to Rosemont Seneca. I have seen each one of the wires. When that prosecutor, Shokin, subpoenaed Cyprus, he got a response. I have the record. They gave him all the information, but two people, Hunter Biden and John Kerry's stepson -- I'm sorry -- John Kerry's speechwriter, who was the best friend of his stepson. ROBERTS: The prosecutor who followed.. GIULIANI: When that happened, Joe Biden knew that they were zeroing in on Hunter. And he went over there and he got him fired. And the next day, people showed up. And they started on getting the case for the kid dismissed, as well as the case for Soros. And that's what brings me into it. ROBERTS: Now, the prosecutor -- the prosecutor... GIULIANI: No, you got to let me finish. ROBERTS: OK. GIULIANI: He said, I went there to get dirt on Joe Biden. Do you know, when I found out about Joe Biden, do know what I told my colleague? They are going to cover this up. Too bad Biden is involved in this. I got a nice straight case of Ukrainian collusion. The minute I say Biden, that Washington press corps is going to go nuts. They have been covering up for years, China, plagiarism. ROBERTS: OK. OK. All right. Now you're straying into areas of opinion, as opposed to fact. GIULIANI: No, I'm not. I'm straying into what is wrong with us today and the unfairness. ROBERTS: We need to point out -- we need to point out that Yuriy Lutsenko, who was the prosecutor who was appointed after Shokin was fire... GIULIANI: Approved by... ROBERTS: ... resurrected, reanimated the case, and found that Hunter Biden was, in fact, paid millions of dollars. But Lutsenko said that the board of Burisma was able to pay a board member whatever they wanted, and he didn't see anything wrong with that. GIULIANI: John, how is the coverage so distorted? ROBERTS: I'm just pointing out a fact. GIULIANI: If you did any work, you would find out Lutsenko is the prosecutor that Biden put in. There's a newspaper article in which Biden approves Lutsenko when he's appointed. Doesn't that strike you as odd, that the vice president would approve a particular prosecutor? Did you ever bother to look? (CROSSTALK) GIULIANI: Let me finish. ROBERTS: One other point we need to make here before we go. GIULIANI: No, no, no, I want answer another question unless you let me finish. This is really unfair. These are very important things that have been covered up for years to protect slimy Joe. The reality is that there are three other prosecutors where all you have to do is go online, three others, that say that this was done precisely to get rid of Biden, to cover up Hunter, and to cover up Soros. I will give you their names. One of them is Kulik, Konstantin Kulik. The other is Shokin himself. And the third one is a prosecutor by the name of Inazdir (ph). They are present officials. Three of them were officials. One is still an official of the Ukrainian government. If you bothered to look, you could listen to them on tape telling you that. Now, they may all be lying, but Lutsenko may be lying also. But it's 3-1. ROBERTS: One more point we got to make. GIULIANI: And Lutsenko is Biden's chosen prosecutor. ROBERTS: OK. You have made your point. One more point to make we need to make. GIULIANI: You will also find there is a great deal of suspicion. ROBERTS: Yes, Joe Biden yesterday told our Peter -- Joe Biden told our Peter Doocy yesterday that he never discussed overseas business with his son Hunter. GIULIANI: Do you believe that? ROBERTS: I don't know. Do you believe that? GIULIANI: I'm flying my son to China. How long is the flight to China? ROBERTS: Its a while. GIULIANI: Fifteen hours, 16 hours, 17? I'm flying my son to China on Air Force Two. I'm going to negotiate with the Chinese to help America. My son is going there to negotiate to help the Biden family. When he comes back, and eight days later, the kid gets a billion dollars in his ridiculous private equity fund run by a recovering drug addict, somebody connected to the vice president of the United States and somebody connected to the biggest gangster in America. Wait a second. The son doesn't say to him, I got a billion dollars? By the way, you see what Joe said? It's contradicted by the son. The son said, I talked to my father about it. How about this? There was an article on December 9 of 2015 in ""The New York Times"" raising holy hell about Biden's son being on the board of the most corrupt company in Ukraine and how strange it looked. I don't know if Joe reads the newspapers, but somebody must have read that to him. And, finally, if Joe didn't know what his son was doing abroad, how may conflicts are there? This guy was flying blind? I don't know. Did he get money from Russia? Did he get money from Cuba? Was he doing business in Venezuela? You're telling me that the vice president of the United States was there for eight years. His son is going around the world taking millions from some adversary of the United States. ROBERTS: Yes. GIULIANI: Don't say yes. This is important. ROBERTS: No, no, we have -- I'm saying we have got to go. GIULIANI: This is about the only time I have gotten to point out a tremendously large scandal that affects the American people. And it's your job to do it, not just mine. I'm doing it to defend my client. ROBERTS: We are out of time. GIULIANI: But you're telling me that he had no system with his son to check on conflicts? So we know of two. We know there's a big conflict with Ukraine. We know there is a big conflict with China. Since Joe says and is apparently selling the swamp media on the fact that he didn't know, well, Joe, how many more conflicts are there? Venezuela? Cuba? ROBERTS: You have mentioned that. We have got to leave it. Mr. Mayor, we are... GIULIANI: One-point-five billion is enough for most people to get investigated. ROBERTS: We are out of time for this morning, but, clearly, we are going to keep looking into this. GIULIANI: And this is going to get bigger and bigger. And everything I say, I can prove. ROBERTS: Rudy, thanks so much for being with us. GIULIANI: Take me on. ROBERTS: All right. Appreciate it. Coming up, we will get reaction to the president's Iran policy with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Ben Cardin joins us here next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: Coming up, President Trump authorizes new economic penalties on Iran. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We have just sanctioned the Iranian national bank. It's going to be at the highest level of sanctions. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: We'll ask our Sunday panel whether the move will bring Tehran back to the negotiating table, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: As the United States boosts its defenses in the Middle East after blaming Iran for the attacks on Saudi oil facilities, the Islamic regime says it's ready for any scenario. Joining me here in Washington, Senator Ben Cardin, a top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator, welcome back to “Fox News Sunday.” SEN. BEN CARDIN, D-MD: John, it's great to be with you. Thank you. ROBERTS: So the U.S. is sending more troops and defensive weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to counter the threat coming from Iran. Your thoughts about sending more men and material there? CARDIN: John, this is a very dangerous situation. There could easily be a miscalculation. The temperature couldn't be harder between the United States and Iran. Our job is to isolate Iran. Iran is the bad actor. And what the president needs to do is get an international coalition to continue to work against Iran's support of terrorism. The challenge, of course, is, because, as the United States has been isolated when the president withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement. So we're having difficulty with our European allies to get the type of support we need, but we have to isolate Iran. ROBERTS: There are reports that -- from the Houthis apparently to Saudi Arabia and to the United States, I don't know if you saw my question to the secretary of state, that Iran is planning another attack in Saudi Arabia. If Iran were, in the middle of all of this, launch another attack at Saudi Arabia, would that demand a military response? CARDIN: There's really not a military solution to the problem of Iran. We need to make diplomacy work. Clearly there could be a miscalculation. We have to defend ourselves, no question about that, but we have to reduce the temp -- where we are, where we could have this miscalculation. It would be disastrous if we got into a fighting war in Iran. It will have consequences throughout the entire region. It's not in our national security interests. ROBERTS: All right, so we've got the United States ramping up sanctions on Iran, withdrawing from the JCPOA, which you yourself didn't -- didn't vote for. And Iran is countering by shooting down American drones, firing missiles and launching drones at Saudi oil facilities. I mean they are in a shooting war. So is -- is this -- is this -- I mean if you let somebody fire at you and you don't shoot back, are you not showing weakness? CARDIN: Well, John, here -- here's the fault of the Trump policies. Before we withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreements, there were conversations with the Europeans about strengthening the sanctions against Iran for the non- nuclear violations. We could have had that international support and tightens the economic pressure against Iran, but still stay within the nuclear agreement. By pulling out of the nuclear agreement, it's the view of Europe that this is an American problem rather than an international problem. ROBERTS: But -- but you know the arguments, this president said, look, it covers the nuclear, but it -- there's a sunset clause to it of a decade, which isn't much when you look at, you know, the history of nuclear development. But it also does not do anything to reign in Iran's malign activities. I pointed out, you yourself did not vote for the JCPOA because you were worried about future uranium enrichment. So why stay in a bad deal? CARDIN: No, I agree with that analysis, but the way to fix it is to work with Europe, work with our partners to deal with the non-nuclear violations, strengths the sanctions against Iran on the non-nuclear side, make sure they stay in compliance with the nuclear obligations. They were in compliance with the nuclear obligations when the United States pulled out. The bottom line is, we made -- the -- we isolated the United States rather than isolating Iran, and Iran is the bad actor. There's no question about it. We don't know what they're going to do, but we certainly need the support of our international partners. ROBERTS: But how serious is Iran about the JCPOA? The United States pulled out. There is still five signatories to it, yet Iran is violating the agreement. CARDIN: Well, the issue is, Iran -- we don't know how Iran's calculating this, but we do know that the U.S. sanctions is having a major impact on their economy. So the benefits they thought they were going to get under the nuclear agreement, they're no longer getting. ROBERTS: Right. CARDIN: That's causing them to recalculate. ROBERTS: For the moment, President Trump says he's showing restraint about Iran. He's got people like Secretary Pompeo saying it's an act of war. Others are pointing fingers, like Mark Esper and Pompeo at Iran. The president saying, I'm going to sit back and wait and see how this plays out. Listen to what he said in the Oval Office the other day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: I think the strong person's approach and the thing that does show strength would be showing a little bit of restraint. Much easier to do it the -- the other way. It's much easier. And Iran knows, if they misbehave, they're on borrowed time. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: So you've got the president's aides on the one hand saying, act of war, Iran's responsible. The president saying, I'm waiting and seeing her. He's leaving the door open to negotiation, even amidst all this tough talk. Could that be a good strategy to try to bring them to the table? CARDIN: I think it's an important week with all the world leaders -- most of the world leaders meeting up in New York for the opening of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I hope that we can get that type of unity with the international community in regards to Iran so that the military option is not the right option. I agree with Secretary Pompeo that diplomacy should be the way we proceed. I agree with that. And hopefully this week we can get the type of support in New York to make a difference in the calculation by Iran so that they stop these horrible things. What they're doing is horrible. We can't let them continue to do that. ROBERTS: Let me switch to this intelligence committee inspector general whistle-blower report. ""The Wall Street Journal"" reported on Friday that the president had a conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, in which he about eight times pressured Zelensky to have Ukraine work with Rudy Giuliani to look into Joe Biden. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said today, quote, I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure. So you have Democrats on the one side calling for the president's impeachment over this, and then you have the Ukrainian foreign minister saying, I don't see any pressure. CARDIN: I think we need to know what happened. The allegations are that the president used the power of his office for partisan political purposes, jeopardizing the national security of the United States by withholding aid to Ukraine, one of our key, strategic partners. That -- ROBERTS: Nobody's made the connection about aid yet. We don't even know what this thing's about. CARDIN: We -- we -- at least there's been some reports that there was $250 million that were held up, ultimately was released -- ROBERTS: I think people have connected the dots, but I don't think we've got anything really to back that up. CARDIN: Well, that's what -- let's find out. Let's -- let's find -- let's have transparency here. We can easily find that out if information about those phone calls would be released and we could see exactly what's involved. But the president has chosen, at least to date, not to release that information. These are serious allegations. Let's find out. I -- I -- I don't want to reach a conclusion. I'm just suggesting to you that an allegation that the president used his political office for partisan reasons, jeopardizing our national security, we need to get to the facts. ROBERTS: Is there a case to be made to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's -- their involvement in Ukraine? Let's listen to what the president said and what Joe Biden said the other day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he is not giving to a certain country less a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. BIDEN: Not one single, credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion. Not one single one. And so I have no comment except the president should start to (INAUDIBLE). (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: Now, in fact, a lot of credible news organizations, including ""The New York Times,"" have been looking into this. Ken Vogel, who's the reporter who wrote about it -- and here's the article -- back in May said on Friday that there's -- this could be a significant issue for Joe Biden and that there's more there. CARDIN: Well -- well, John, I know what happened in 2015 with the prosecutor. The international community needed that prosecutor to leave. Congress wanted that prosecutor to leave. Corruption was the center problem we had with Ukraine, maintaining our coalition against Russia for -- with sanctions. And we had to deal with the corrupt issues and the prosecutor was in the center of that. So that -- that was a policy that we wanted to implement. Joe Biden's issue has been looked at for a long time. There's been findings that there is no improper involvement. This is a distraction by the president of the United States to distract from his most recent situation. ROBERTS: You don't want to prejudge the situation with the president and his whistle-blower, but a lot of your Democratic colleagues are already making the leap to impeachment. Is that going too far? CARDIN: I -- I think you need to get the facts. I don't think you should -- you know, the impeachment process is a way in which Congress exercises its responsibility, checks and balances in our system. But you can't act on that type of a remedy until you have the facts. So let's get the facts first. ROBERTS: Senator Cardin, always good to see you. CARDIN: Nice to be with you. ROBERTS: Thanks so much for coming in. Coming up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the prospects of a showdown between the United States and Iran. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: I think it's abundantly clear and there is an enormous consensus in the region that we know precisely who conducted these attacks. It was Iran. NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What would be the consequence of an American or a Saudi military strike on Iran now? MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: An all-out war. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: The top diplomats from this country and Iran in a war of words this week over the fallout from the attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil industry. And its time now for our Sunday group. Jonah Goldberg for ""The National Review,"" Fox News political analyst Juan Williams, Susan Page of ""USA Today,"" and Matthew Continetti, founding editor of ""The Washington Free Beacon."" Are we going to war, Susan, with Iran? SUSAN PAGE, ""USA TODAY"": Well, judging from your interview with Secretary of State Pompeo, I'd say probably not. He -- you asked them if it's an active war, does that demand a military response, and he repeatedly denied -- declined to say yes. And judging from what the president did in June, after the American drone was shot down and he backed away from a military strike, I think the odds are against us taking military action in this case. ROBERTS: The fact that he backed away from that strike, does that mean that he cannot take military action? MATTHEW CONTINETTI, ""WASHINGTON FREE BEACON"": No. I mean he could take military action at any time. He's the commander-in-chief. What we're seeing, though, is that the maximum pressure campaign of the Trump administration has met maximum resistance from the Iranian regime. And the cyber operations and the economic warfare that the Trump White House has been waging against Iran has yet to deter them from their malign behavior in the region. But, that status quo is something I think the president prefers to all-out war. ROBERTS: Right. It -- the -- Congress is saying he's got to come to Congress for an authorization to use military force against Iran. First of all, does he have to? And if he went to Congress, would he get it? JONAH GOLDBERG, ""NATIONAL REVIEW"": It depends. I think we would need more provocation than what we have seen. I'm sort of a purist on this kind of stuff. I do think that you should go to Congress, unless it's in response to an immediate and urgent national security thing, then it -- Congress has the -- has the sole authority to authorize war. But we've seen that eroded so much over the last 50 years, like so many other congressional prerogatives that I think it's anybody's guess. JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: I think, John, based on your question, you can tell there's no clear end game in sight. What we know is the president says he doesn't want war there, but he's previously also said we're locked and loaded. And what was incredible to me was to hear him say that he's waiting for guidance to come from the Saudis. Now, the Iranians are no friends of ours, but, gosh, the Saudis, I don't know if they're a reliable and trustworthy regime. They kill American journalists. 9/11 is not to be forgotten. ROBERTS: And here's another argument that people made. The United States has sold Saudi Arabia, and the president made a big deal of this, billions of dollars in military equipment. Can't the Saudis handle this themselves? PAGE: And -- well, I guess we're going to find out. I mean we're making this gesture to Saudi Arabia with a very limited deployment. But -- but, yes, Saudi Arabia has a lot of defensive abilities, a lot of it provided by the United States, helped by the United States. WILLIAMS: But I think the key point here is, Iran has denied responsibility, but we have no reason to trust that they are not responsible, or at least supporting the Houthi rebels that did this. But the point from the American political perspective is, we are still trying to get out of Afghanistan. There is no appetite in his country for starting another war without a clear end game in sight. And the president has not provided that. CONTINETTI: And the president's policy, it reflects exactly that attitude though. WILLIAMS: Right. We all know what we're doing (ph). PAGE: And the president's base doesn't back it either (ph). CONTINETTI: He doesn't want to get involved either. What's remarkable here, for 70 years plus, the United States has guaranteed the free flow of oil from the Persian Gulf. That is ending. At its ending because of fracking. ROBERTS: Let's get on to the whistle-blower issue here. President Trump, he was leaving for Houston a short time ago. He said this about his conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of the Ukraine, back on July 25th. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: The conversation I had with the president of Ukraine was absolutely perfect. And people better find out who these people are that are trying to subvert our country, because here we go again. These are bad people. But the conversation I had with the president of Ukraine was absolutely a ten. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: So it was a ten. Is there anything wrong with the president saying to the president of the Ukraine, look, why don't you work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate what ties Joe Biden and Hunter Biden have to Ukrainian natural gas companies. PAGE: Yes. It's soliciting foreign help in your campaign for re-election for president of the United States. And it's something that I think people would generally find alarming. ROBERTS: Now, the Ukraine helped Hillary Clinton, so -- GOLDBERG: Yes, OK, look, I mean we've got to separate a whole bunch of things here. The idea -- you know, people who are -- you know, President Trump has -- has some weird messaging on this. On the one hand he says it's all made up and fake news. On the other hand he says he was spied on, which would suggest that, in fact, the allegations are true. Rudy Giuliani comes on air today and take great umbrage at the accusation or insinuation that he's a political hit man, and then he spends the next seven minutes like the -- one of the biggest political hit men I've ever seen. It could be -- I don't -- I think there's a lot of smoke and -- and bluster going on in what Giuliani is doing. It could all be true. If the president of the United States tried to bend national security, based upon his own partisan self-interest, that would be very, very, very bad. And the people who say he's just interested in corruption, this seems to be the only corruption case in the world he's concerned about, is the one about the guy who's beating him by ten points in the polls. ROBERTS: ""The Washington Examiner"" had an article this morning that suggested that the whistle-blower does not have firsthand knowledge of any of this. But the point is, is that if you're going to investigate the president, and there are 9,573 investigations of the president going on right now, should you not also investigate the person who might become president? CONTINETTI: A lot of conversations in Washington over the last 48 hours have begun with the word ""if."" And the fact is, we don't know. And so I think the advocates of impeachment in this case carry a heavy burden, John. One is that with the Russian investigation, there was a whole lot of misreporting and factual inaccuracy in the actual reporting. Two, when the Mueller report came out, it did not provide the data that Democrats wanted to impeach. And, third, all of these charges, as illustrated in Rudy Giuliani's interview with you, have the potential to boomerang on the Democratic Party. ROBERTS: All right, so let me ask you about the Democratic Party, Juan. You heard Ben Cardin say he doesn't want to prejudge anything. He wants the information. He wants to see this. You've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. You've got Elizabeth Warren. You've got a myriad of other Democrats not even waiting for a shred of evidence here. They're looking at reporting and saying, impeach him, off with his head. I mean should they not wait -- do they not have a responsibility to wait until we know some facts here before we got down the impeachment road? WILLIAMS: Yes, I think everyone should wait. But, remember, there's no reason to wait on the transcript. If, as the president describes it, nothing untoward took place, why is it that the administration is making such an effort to obstruct the Congress from getting that transcript? What we know is -- ROBERTS: It's not the transcript that they're not holding back -- WILLIAMS: Well -- ROBERTS: It's the complaint. WILLIAMS: Well, the complaint, the transcript, the whole thing. If -- because the transcript goes beyond the complaint, which is why I said transcript. But the idea is that this administration has, through the Justice Department, stop what is the law. The law says that if you have an urgent complaint, the inspector general of the director of national intelligence would transfer that to the Congress. It's not going on. That is wrong. GOLDBERG: Previous presidents have also disputed the idea that the president has an obligation by the -- by statute to do that. It's a -- it's a murky constitutional issue. PAGE: The one Democrat we haven't heard from calling for impeachment is the one Democrat who counts, Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She set a standard that we need to hear Republicans be outraged by the president's behavior, not just Democrats. And so far we haven't heard that. ROBERTS: Fifteen seconds. CONTINETTI: We'll be waiting for a long time. ROBERTS: Yes, Fifteen seconds, should the transcript be released? WILLIAMS: Of course. CONTINETTI: I think if it exculpates Trump, they should release it. But there is the issue of executive privilege here, governing foreign communications, which also needs to be respected. WILLIAMS: If this was Obama, House Republicans would have -- ROBERTS: We've got to go. Thanks, Juan. See you next Sunday, by the way. Coming up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" Denzel Washington and the club he says made him the man he is today. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: For many children, the hours between three and 8:00 p.m. are when their futures are decided. As Chris Wallace reported last fall, one organization has opened its doors for over 100 years to make sure that kids have a place to go after school and stay out of trouble. One of those kids became a household name, and he is our ""Power Player of the Week."" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DENZEL WASHINGTON, BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS NATIONAL SPOKESMAN: It's where I learned so many life lessons, just thinking I was having fun. CHRIS WALLACE, HOST (voice over): Denzel Washington is talking with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Four thousand local clubs that provide after-school programs for more than 4 million young people. And, in the process, change lives. He was in Washington last fall for the group's annual dinner. WASHINGTON: I remember that first day and how I felt and how special they made me feel. WALLACE: And to honor the national youth of the year. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Malachi Haynes. WALLACE: Malachi Haynes of Colorado, who's been going to his club since he was six. MALACHI HAYNES, BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB 2018 YOUTH OF THE YEAR: Being a leader and a role model in my community is my purpose. WASHINGTON: I was a wild one. You know, I was -- I had a lot of energy. WALLACE: Washington used to run track for his club. And he remembers when a new kid came in and started running faster. One of his mentors took him aside. WASHINGTON: He said, he has natural ability, but his natural ability will only take him so far. So I applied that to -- to -- to my career, my first two years when I started acting in college. WALLACE: Washington won the first of his two Oscars for his role in ""Glory,"" about an African-American military unit in the Civil War. For more than 30 years, he's played a series of indelible characters. WASHINGTON: To protect the sheep, you've got to catch the wolf. And it takes a wolf to catch a wolf, you understand? I was never interested in being a movie star. We were sort of New York theater snobs. I wanted to be James Earl Jones, you know? I was hoping to make $650 on Broadway one day. And -- and I did. WALLACE (on camera): Your father was a preacher and I've read that at various points in your life you've thought about becoming a preacher. WASHINGTON: Uh-huh. WALLACE: Really? WASHINGTON: It was prophesies that I would preach. And -- by this woman. And I said, well, maybe that's what I'm supposed to do. And says, well, you already have a pulpit. WALLACE (voice over): Now, Washington is more about giving back. WASHINGTON: You never see a U-Haul behind a hearse. That's what my pastor told me. You know, you -- whatever you have, you can't take it with you. So the question is, what are you going to do with what you have while you're here? WALLACE (voice over): The Boys & Girls Clubs deal with the ups and downs of life too. Kids at the clubs do better at school, are less likely to do drugs, and volunteer more. Malachi started his own program to improve reading levels. HAYNES: We call it Double Trouble. So we do an hour of reading, then an hour of playing basketball, eating pizza, just hanging out and getting to know the kids. WALLACE: And Denzel Washington says that's the real message here. WASHINGTON: We're just bombarded so much with negative news that the -- one can just feel like, well, what's the -- what's the use? But listening to these young people saying, oh, no, no, we're going to change it, we're going to do something about it, I'm -- that's inspiring. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: Chris asked Washington where he sees himself at this stage of his career. He says he uses stuntmen more than he used to but is excited about the unknown and what comes next in his life and career. And that's it for today. Chris is back again next weekend.

"Trump addresses reporters as he arrives at the United Nations, says 'what Biden did was wrong.' It was in the national interest of the United States that Ukraine, under siege by our Russian nemesis, be given the full quantum of military aid extended by Congress. It was in the political interest of  President Trump  that Ukraine aggressively investigate credible allegations of corruption and conflict-of-interest against former Vice President Joe Biden, a favorite among the Democratic candidates seeking to run against Trump in 2020. The national interests of the United States and the political interests of the president are not the same thing. If President Trump conflated them in his discussions with  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , that was a failure of judgment. But have we lost our capacity to say conduct is censurable without turning it into something it is not – such as effective immunity for  Biden  and grounds for Trump’s impeachment? GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN Don’t get me wrong. It is not my purpose to minimize the politicization of American foreign relations. To the contrary, I just wrote a book, "" Ball of Collusion: The Plot to Rig an Election and Destroy a Presidency. "" In many ways, it is a ""cri de coeur"" for a restoration of a vital American norm. Incumbent administrations must not wield the awesome powers of the presidency, especially the powers to conduct foreign affairs and gather foreign intelligence, out of sheer partisanship. My purpose is to place the potential wrong in context. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Let’s say, for argument’s sake, it is proven that Trump used his enormous influence over Kiev, or worse, his control over the release of defense aid Ukraine needs, strictly to better his electoral chances against Biden. That would be an abuse of power. It would also make the 45th president, well, the 45th president in American history to exercise his powers under the influence of his political standing. That is particularly true of presidents seeking reelection, even if we suspect that most exploitations of foreign relations power for electoral advantage have been less crude than Trump’s alleged squeezing of Ukraine. On that score, we must note that Trump denies exerting pressure and Ukraine denies that it felt pressured. Moreover, reports indicate that while the president urged his counterpart, repeatedly, to look into Biden’s alleged corruption, Trump did not explicitly tie that request to a release of $250 million in U.S. defense aid – although that aid, previously approved by Congress, was being slow-walked for reasons the administration has yet to explain. Still, even if we assume that the president delayed the aid in order to spur Kiev regarding Biden, that hardly means Biden’s conduct and patent conflict-of-interest do not rate scrutiny. In one of his notorious speak-first-think-later flourishes, Biden openly bragged that, as President Obama’s vice president, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in financial aid Kiev desperately needed as a quid pro quo to extort Ukraine’s government into firing a prosecutor. As the invaluable investigative journalist Peter Schweizer  outlined  in a Fox News column, this prosecutor was investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company that had put Biden’s son, Hunter, on its board under circumstances strongly suggesting it was currying favor with the then-vice president. Hunter Biden was lavishly compensated, notwithstanding that he had no discernible expertise in the energy sector. Ukraine, moreover, is no one-off. Rudy Giuliani, the president’s private lawyer (who hired me as a prosecutor more years ago than either of us would care to remember), has pointed out that Hunter Biden accompanied Biden on Air Force Two for a trip to China about U.S. government business that apparently turned into an eye-popping $1.5 billion windfall for the then-vice president’s son. That is, Biden proved quite accommodating as the Obama administration’s point-man on relations with Beijing, and Beijing quickly made an astonishing injection of capital into an investment firm started by Hunter Biden and Chris Heinz (the stepson of then-Secretary of State John Kerry). As Schweizer details in his important book, ""Secret Empires,"" the Communist Chinese government became a partner in the venture, as did a Massachusetts-based consultancy firm headed by James Bulger – son of the powerful former Massachusetts state senator Billy Bulger, and nephew and namesake of the notorious mobster Whitey Bulger. That Trump may have been ham-handed in raising Biden allegations in the context of U.S.-Ukrainian relations does not mean Biden should get a pass. Indeed, if these activities involved a son of Donald Trump rather than Joe Biden, The New York Times and The Washington Post would already have assigned the usual five or 10 alpha-journalists apiece, and we’d already have been treated to the usual breathless hourly updates on CNN and MSNBC. Obviously, a president can be in the wrong without being impeachable. Impeachment is a political remedy. It is a nonstarter in the absence of broad, bipartisan public support, which is plainly lacking in Trump’s case. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Political wrongs, if they are established, must be measured against the conduct of past presidents. Extensive investigations are underway of the Obama administration’s exploitation of foreign relations and foreign intelligence powers to influence the 2016 election – favoring Hillary Clinton and targeting Trump. Presumably, these investigations are inquiring into the relationship between the Obama administration and Ukraine. That relationship involved not only dropping an investigation of Hunter Biden’s company, but revving up an investigation of Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman. (At least, he was until media leaks sourced to Ukrainian officials resulted in his ouster.) If Trump abused his powers, he was wrong to do so. It will make his reelection bid more difficult. But let’s not pretend he would the first to play this unsavory game. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY"

"""We have a Senate that instead of trying to harness the opportunity and potential of every person in this country, they're trying to pull us back,"" Kennedy said Saturday in announcing his run. ""And I'm running for the United States Senate to tear that down, to fight back with everything we've got."" In recent weeks, Kennedy, 38, has sought to draw a generational contrast with Markey, 73, while benefiting from the goodwill shown for the generations of Kennedys who have represented the state before him.  In a campaign email Saturday, Kennedy lists conversations he's had with constituents following President Donald Trump's election and ""outdated structures and old rules"" as reasons he decided to enter the Senate race.  ""This is the fight of our lives, the fight of my generation — and I'm all in,"" he said.  Kennedy is the heir to a political dynasty that has never lost an election in the state, the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy and the son of former Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy II. One great uncle, Ted Kennedy, served in the Senate for nearly 50 years. Another, John F. Kennedy, won his first congressional race in 1946, when Markey was born. Kennedy drew on his family's long ties to Massachusetts in his announcement Saturday. ""It's extremely meaningful to me to be able to do this here, where in 1848 a few steps from where this building is today, my father's family first arrived here in this country,"" he said. Kennedy told reporters on Thursday that Markey is ""a good man,"" but had other issues he wanted to address in the race. Kennedy volunteered for the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic and worked as an assistant district attorney for Massachusetts before his election to Congress in 2012.  Last year, Kennedy gave the Democratic party's official response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, calling for a ""better deal,"" a ""living wage,"" paid leave, affordable child care, ""solvent"" pensions, ""fair"" trade pacts, good roads and a ""health care system that offers mercy, whether you suffer from cancer or depression or addiction."" He also turned his sights on the President. ""Bullies may land a punch,"" he said. ""They might leave a mark. But they have never, not once, in the history of our United States, managed to match the strength and spirit of a people united in defense of their future."" Some viewers focused less on his message and more on his mouth, wondering about his shiny lips. In 2019, Kennedy gave some advice to this year's speaker, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, tweeting to ""misplace your chapstick."" In the past several weeks, as the congressman's interest in the Senate seat became clear, Markey lined up prominent Democratic endorsements. His backers include fellow Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a presidential candidate, and  over 100 state legislators , including House Speaker Robert DeLeo and Senate President Karen Spilka.  ""I endorsed Ed Markey six months ago, seven months ago. I've cut a video for him. Eddie has been a great partner in the Senate,"" Warren told reporters last month, referencing her February decision. ""I think I know why you're asking that and if it's about Joe Kennedy, I will also say Joe Kennedy is also a great partner. He and Lauren were both my students and I worked with Joe before either one of us was in politics and have worked with him ever since he's been in Congress. He's really an amazing person."" US Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democrats' campaign arm and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the firebrand freshman, also back Markey. ""I'm going to run on all the issues I've been fighting for today and into the future: climate change, income inequality, a woman's right to choose and on gun safety legislation,"" said Markey this week. ""I am going to continue those fights into this campaign and I will do so every day that I'm out there crisscrossing the state of Massachusetts and fighting for the people of our state."" Rep. Lori Trahan, Democrat of Massachusetts, has endorsed Markey and said that Kennedy's entry to the race will not change her mind. She told CNN she supports Markey for his leadership on both local and national issues, including his work  addressing pipeline explosions  in her district and his role sponsoring the Green New Deal. She added that even though she's for Markey, ""I think the world of Joe."" Other Massachusetts Democrats are so far keeping out of the race, including Reps. Seth Moulton and Ayanna Pressley, who won their House seats through taking on sitting congressmen in primary campaigns in 2014 and 2018. Moulton told CNN that both Kennedy and Markey are ""great progressive leaders for the state."" In an interview, Pressley said she looked forward to continue working with Markey on environmental and gun control issues, while working with Kennedy on mental health care.  ""I think primaries are healthy,"" Pressley added. When asked about whether he had tried to flip the endorsements of his fellow members of Congress, Kennedy told reporters on Thursday that he respected the decisions that they've made.  ""The race is going to be decided by the people of Massachusetts,"" Kennedy said."
"According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump did not offer a quid pro quo to Volodymyr Zelensky during the July call; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports. As Congress and the White House wrestle over a whistleblower’s complaint against  President Trump , the story took a new turn late Friday when the  Wall Street Journal reported  that, in a July phone call, Trump “repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine” to investigate the dealings of Joe Biden’s family in Ukraine. Trump’s call is reportedly the source of a complaint by a whistleblower against the president that has sparked a furor among Democrats in Congress, who are demanding to see the complaint. If, as multiple news organizations are reporting, the whistleblower’s complaint centers on Ukraine, there is strong evidence that it relates to President Trump’s urging the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son. NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT The story behind that story is itself worthy of serious scrutiny. The proposed investigation involves Hunter Biden’s involvement with a controversial Ukrainian natural gas company while then-Vice President Biden was overseeing America’s Ukraine policy. Critics of the president have accused Trump of attempting to “extort” Ukrainian officials for “dirt” on Biden, the current front-runner for the Democratic nomination to run against Trump next year. But why would Ukraine have dirt on Joe Biden? For answers, one must look at Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company which, until earlier this year, employed Hunter Biden. In April 2014,  Hunter Biden agreed  to join Burisma’s board of directors, ostensibly to advise on legal issues, The New Yorker reported. Biden had no known expertise on the natural gas industry, but Burisma was certainly in need of help. Earlier that month, British officials  had frozen  the London bank accounts of Burisma’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, and soon after, Ukrainian officials opened their own  corruption investigation  into Burisma, the Kyiv Post in Ukraine reported. Hunter Biden helped to recruit a legal team for Burisma, including former Obama administration Justice Department official John Buretta and several American consulting firms, The  New York Times reported. The younger Biden was well compensated for his efforts. Records obtained by the Government Accountability Institute show he was paid as much as $83,333 per month for his work at Burisma. Hunter Biden claims he had no role in the investigation of the company, and that he never spoke about it with his father – but the facts show a troubling overlap with the Obama administration’s actions in Ukraine. On April 16, 2014, White House records show that Devon Archer, Hunter Biden’s business partner, made a private visit to the White House for a meeting with Vice President Biden. Five days later, on April 21, Joe Biden landed in Kiev for a series of high-level meetings with Ukrainian officials. Soon the United States and the International Monetary Fund would be pumping more than $1 billion into the Ukrainian economy, as  I wrote in the New York Post . CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The next day, there was a public announcement that Archer had been asked to join the board of Burisma. Three weeks after that, on May 13, it was officially announced that Hunter Biden would join, too. Like Hunter Biden, Archer had no background or experience in the energy sector. In March 2016, Ukrainian officials fired Viktor Shokin, the controversial prosecutor general whose office was overseeing the investigation into Burisma, The  New York Times reported . Six months later, the Burisma case was dropped entirely, the  Kyiv Post reported . According to Joe Biden himself, the former vice president played a key role in the prosecutor’s dismissal. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In March 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loans if Shokin was not fired, according to Biden, who recounted the exchange in  a 2018 speech : “I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b----. He got fired.” While the propriety of Trump’s call to the Ukrainian president is certainly questionable and worthy of inquiry, the investigation he was hoping for certainly seems warranted on its own merits.

"Trump addresses reporters as he arrives at the United Nations, says 'what Biden did was wrong.' President Trump  did not mince words on Monday when voicing his feelings toward the  media’s coverage  of reports that the president pressured Ukraine's leader to help investigate political rival Joe Biden. Calling the White House press corps “crooked as hell,” a riled up Trump slammed the media for “double standards” over what he claimed was the failure of the press to report on allegations of unsubstantiated wrongdoing by Biden and his son, Hunter, related to dealings with Kyiv. “Joe Biden and his son are corrupt, but the fake news doesn’t want to report because they’re Democrats,” Trump said in New York during United Nations meetings. “If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair.” ROMNEY WANTS ANSWERS IN WHISTLEBLOWER STORY Trump added: Look at the double standards, you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves…You got a lot of crooked journalists, you’re crooked as hell.” The president’s heated comments came as congressional Democrats are pressing for a full disclosure of a whistleblower's complaint about Trump’s phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump acknowledged Monday that he didn't want to give money to Ukraine if there were corruption issues. His comments raised further questions about whether he improperly used his office to pressure the country into investigating the former vice president and his family. ""It's very important to talk about corruption,"" Trump told reporters as he opened meetings at the United Nations. ""If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is, is corrupt?"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump has sought to implicate Biden and his son, Hunter, in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son. The matter is under new scrutiny following the whistleblower's mid-August complaint, which followed Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The person who filed the complaint did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, according to a person familiar with the matter. Lawmakers are demanding details of the complaint, but the acting director of national intelligence has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. Trump hinted on Monday that he may release the details of the phone conversation, but said its contents mainly consisted of congratulating the new Ukrainian leader. Fox News’ John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"And you would be wrong! ""It is regrettable that House Intelligence Committee Chairman (Adam) Schiff and Senator (Chuck) Schumer have chosen to politicize the issue,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said from the floor of the Senate on Monday, adding that the ""specific subject"" of the whistleblower complaint filed to to the intelligence community inspector general remains unknown. (It doesn't. Trump has made clear that a) he talked to the Ukrainian President and b) mentioned on that call the idea that Biden and his son, Hunter, might be involved in corrupt activity in the country.) Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who was once seen as a rare Republican willing to question Trump, had this to say when  asked by Vice's Liz Landers  if he had a comment on the Trump/Ukraine news: ""You're welcome to talk to James in my office."" And Texas Sen. John Cornyn had  this to say about the whistleblower : ""I am a little troubled that apparently some of the initial reports came form somebody that didn't have firsthand knowledge, and then it sort of took off like a wildfire."" So, yeah. The reason that questions about Trump's behavior throughout this Ukraine drama won't be the final straw in the Republican relationship with Trump is because there will never be a final straw in Republicans' relationship with Trump. When he won the GOP nomination, the vast, vast, vast majority of GOPers simply decided that even though they didn't support him initially and still had LOTS of questions about how he went about things, Trump was channeling their base and the only way to stay alive politically was to support him without question. Which is what they have done. Through the Mueller report and its double-digit instances of obstructive behavior by the President. Through his calls for four non-white Democratic congresswomen to ""go back"" where they came from. (Three of the four were born in the United States). And now through this. And to be clear, here's what we know this is -- based on what Trump has already said he did: The sitting President of the United States floated the idea that the 2020 Democratic frontrunner was doing something nefarious to a world leader and may have urged said world leader to investigate. (Here's what Trump said Monday afternoon at the UN General Assembly meetings in New York City: ""There was no pressure put on them whatsoever. I put no pressure on them whatsoever. I could have. I think it probably, possibly would have been OK if I did."") Regardless of whether there was a specific ask for an investigation or some kind of quid pro quo offered by Trump -- The Washington Post has reported there was a ""promise"" made between Trump and the Ukrainian President -- this is already the sort of stuff that any Republican should be willing to criticize the President about. After all, even if Trump didn't offer a quid pro quo, he quite clearly was aware of the power imbalance between the two nations and the fact that Ukraine would be eager to please the US. That's not to say that every Republican should come out for impeaching Trump today. Far from it. But, it is to say that the unwillingness to criticize behavior that is clearly un-presidential (at best) reeks of the bargain the party made with itself when Trump won: Winning matters more than anything and everything else. The Point : The silence from Republicans is deafening. Again."

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , pulling ahead of the primary field in the most recent Iowa polling,  Greg Gutfeld  believes the presidential hopeful is just playing the waiting game and letting her competition -- including  former Vice President Joe Biden  -- ""drip"" away voters. ""She's like a bucket under a leak. She doesn't have to do anything, the leaks just fall into her bucket because Sanders is leaking people and Biden is leaking people,"" Gutfeld said on "" The Five "" Monday.

"The facts of whether the President pressured Ukraine to investigate his potential Democratic general election opponent  Joe Biden  while a US military aid package was on the table are still obscured. Trump supporters say there is so far no evidence that he offered a quid pro quo to the Ukrainians and note that an intelligence community  whistleblower who raised the alarm  was operating with a second-hand knowledge of Trump's conversations. But if Trump used his power to try to coerce a foreign leader into influencing US elections, it could precipitate the worst political crisis of a presidency that has been mired in notoriety from its first hours. It would amount to a situation in which Trump's team, which according to the Mueller report expected to benefit from Russian election meddling in 2016, is now using the power of the presidency to incite collusion ahead of the 2020 election. That possibility seemed to unlock a shift Sunday in the Democratic position on impeachment. House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said on CNN that Trump may have ""crossed the Rubicon."" And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- who has been loath to contemplate an impeachment drama -- warned that events might necessitate a ""new stage of investigation."" Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat on the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs panels, told CNN on Monday morning, ""I think we're reaching a tipping point both within our base and within our caucus."" Republican senators who have strongly supported Trump were largely silent but Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah  tweeted  Sunday ""it would be troubling in the extreme"" if Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden and that it is ""critical for the facts to come out."" There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son Hunter. The then-Ukrainian prosecutor general Yury Lutsenko said in May that Burisma Holdings, a major energy company,  did not violate Ukrainian law  by having Hunter Biden on its board and paying him. Trump's claims that Biden pushed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor because he investigated a business for which his son served as a board member have previously been found to be false. The prosecutor was seen as corrupt by multiple governments and international institutions, not just the former vice president. Why pressure by Trump on Ukrainians would matter Presidents are expected to act in the interests of all Americans and not to use their vast discretion in foreign policy to pursue political vendettas or subvert US democracy. The Founders saw the presidency as a public trust, meaning that its incumbents should not put their personal interests over the national interest. The Ukraine story is so significant because it may have the potential to fall into such grave constitutional territory and could represent an abuse of presidential power. Trump and his team seemed at odds Sunday over whether to publish the transcript of his conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And they went on offense in typical fashion, bending facts and spinning conspiracy theories, obfuscation and hypocrisy. Trump insisted that he said ""absolutely nothing wrong"" in the call with the Ukrainian president. ""It was perfect,"" he said. Trump often gives the impression that he believes he is not constrained by norms on the limits of power observed by past presidents. In July for instance, he said, falsely, that Article 2 of the Constitution ""allows me to do whatever I want as President."" Past scrapes like the 2016 Russian election meddling scandal -- and multiple controversies ranging from his insulting behavior toward the late Sen. John McCain to his payments to women who claimed they had affairs with him -- have failed to bring him down. His emergence from each may have taught him a lesson. Trump says he spoke to Ukrainian President about Biden Trump on Sunday appeared to add new context to the Ukraine story when he said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Ukraine's president at a time when Kiev was awaiting a $250 million military aid package from the United States. The call with Zelensky took place on July 25. Congress passed the bill in August and the White House lifted a hold on the money in September. ""The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,"" Trump said. CNN has reported that Trump urged Zelensky to investigate Biden's son in a call on July 25, but did not discuss a pending aid package at the time, indicating there may not have been an explicit quid pro quo outlined in the conversation. The latest developments highlighted Pelosi's reluctance to trigger impeachment proceedings against Trump amid fears of a political backlash. But Schiff, a Pelosi ally, suggested things may be about to change. ""This would be an extraordinary remedy, a remedy of last resort and not first resort,"" Schiff said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""But if the President is essentially withholding military aid at the same time he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that that conduct represents."" Pelosi and Schiff were in close coordination throughout the weekend talking about the Ukraine whistleblower story and coordinating strategy, a leadership aide confirmed to CNN. The way that events could force the hands of Democratic leaders became even clearer later on Sunday. Pelosi hinted at a change of strategy in a message to Democratic colleagues, over half of whom had already backed the idea of impeachment. ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi wrote on Sunday. Democratic reluctance on impeachment Pelosi has been reluctant to embrace impeachment since Senate Republicans are unlikely to vote to convict the President. There is also no desire to set Trump's political base alight as Democrats try to keep their House majority in 2020. If Trump's behavior is exposed as corrupt, Democrats may be forced into impeachment hearings -- whatever the long-term political cost. To do nothing would be to accept that a President can abuse his power by seeking foreign interference in American democracy. Trump would feel validated and emboldened. The balance between Congress and the Presidency will have been fundamentally altered and there will be few checks and balances left capable of constraining Trump and future presidents. Inaction might also be politically unsustainable since Democrats might see their own leaders as willing to use the power of a House majority to defend their own presidential front-runner. Democrats, both freshmen from Trump-won districts and moderates who have resisted calls for impeachment, are telling their colleagues privately they are prepared to announce their support for impeachment proceedings if the controversy continues to grow -- namely if there's evidence that Trump sought to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigating the Bidens, according to Democratic sources involved in the conversations on Monday morning.   That could change the calculus for Pelosi, who has in part resisted because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash over impeachment. But if those members come out in support of impeachment proceedings, Pelosi is bound to shift her positioning as well, according to Democrats close to the speaker. Trump allies hit back Seeking to fog such questions, Trump's lieutenants went on the offensive on Sunday talk shows using a familiar playbook. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo revived debunked questions about Biden's conduct. ""I do think if Vice President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt, I do think we need to get to the bottom of that,"" Pompeo said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""America cannot have our elections interfered with, and if that's what took place there, if there was that kind of activity engaged in by Vice President Biden, we need to know."" For the administration to make an argument about electoral interference seems somewhat rich, given that Trump has long rejected evidence that Russia intervened in 2016 to help him. On ""State of the Union,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said there was no reason to believe Trump pressured Ukraine, though admitted he wasn't on the call in question. And he argued that Biden's son should not have been allowed to do business in Ukraine while his father was vice president. Asked by Jake Tapper Sunday about the glaring inconsistency in this statement since Trump's children continue to work globally on a business from which the President has not fully divested, Mnuchin dodged. ""I don't really want to go into more of these details,"" Mnuchin said. Both Mnuchin and Pompeo opposed releasing transcripts of Trump's calls, arguing that a President has a right to confidentiality in conversations with foreign leaders. The administration's efforts to stop acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire from releasing the whistleblower report to Congress, and its opposition to releasing a transcript, are only fueling speculation the White House has something to hide. If there was wrongdoing such conduct could equal obstruction of justice, historically an impeachable offense. Trump, however, said that he hoped they would release the transcript. Biden, meanwhile, spent the weekend  defending himself  and trying to turn the scandal to his own advantage in a tight primary race. ""Trump is doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum and he is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" Biden said. This story has been updated with additional developments Monday."

"The mainstream media is failing to hold  Joe Biden  accountable for discrepancies regarding his explanations about his son's business dealings in  Ukraine , White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Monday on  ""Fox & Friends"" . ""He’s not telling the truth and the fact checkers are asleep because it’s Joe Biden and they’re asleep to not even check their own facts, their own reporting when he admitted that he talked to his father.

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE' The Trump administration pushed back  Tuesday in the wake of multiple reports that the White House froze millions in aid to Ukraine shortly before President Trump pressured the country's leader to  investigate  Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The reports coincided with a renewed round of calls, including from more centrist Democrats, for a formal impeachment inquiry. Those calls came a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she is opening the door to that route if the administration continues to withhold a whistleblower complaint apparently related to  Trump's Ukraine  discussions. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats have called for the transcript of the phone call to be released. Conway said Trump hopes the contents of the call are made public, but noted the potential ramifications for foreign policy. ""You don’t want to have a chilling effect on other leaders wanting to speak with the president. But you saw him yesterday. He said, 'I hope you will learn what’s in there. It was a perfect call,'"" she responded. Fox News' John Roberts and Brooke Singman contributed to this report."
"DES MOINES — Allegations that President Trump courted foreign interference from Ukraine to hurt his leading Democratic rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr., dominated presidential politics on Saturday, as Mr. Biden demanded a House investigation of Mr. Trump’s phone call   with Ukraine’s leader and as Mr. Trump lashed out, denying wrongdoing without releasing a transcript of the call. With Mr. Trump seizing on a familiar defense, saying Democrats were undertaking a “witch hunt” against him, Mr. Biden called on the House of Representatives to begin a new investigation of whether the president sought the interference of a foreign government to bolster his re-election campaign. “This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power,” Mr. Biden said during a campaign swing in Iowa. “We have never seen anything like this from any president.” Mr. Trump is said to have urged the Ukrainian president on a July 25 phone call to investigate Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who did business in Ukraine while his father was vice president. Mr. Trump’s request is part of a secret whistle-blower complaint in the intelligence community that is said to involve Mr. Trump making an unspecified commitment to a foreign leader, according to two people familiar with the complaint. The sharp accusations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden elevated the president’s dealings with Ukraine as a potentially significant new issue in the presidential race, and offered voters a preview of what is likely to be an extraordinary general election contest  if Mr. Biden were to win the nomination.  The controversy has focused on whether Mr. Trump manipulated foreign policy — a military aid package to Ukraine had been delayed at the time of the phone call — to pressure the country’s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to take action to damage Mr. Biden’s election bid. On Saturday, Mr. Trump sought to deflect attention from that question by accusing Mr. Biden of acting improperly as vice president in calling for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had overseen an inquiry into corruption related to the oligarch whose company employed Hunter Biden.  Mr. Trump  described his conversation with Mr. Zelensky as  “perfectly fine and routine. ” “Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He said that any effort to investigate him would fail, comparing it to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into his ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign. Intensifying a line of attack he and his allies have stoked for months, Mr. Trump said the real problem was Mr. Biden and questions about what the president described as “the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son.”  Referring to his conversation with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump said: “Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster.” No evidence  has surfaced to support Mr. Trump’s claim that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor general’s dismissal. But some State Department officials had expressed concern that Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine could complicate his father’s diplomacy there. The issue strikes a particular nerve for Mr. Biden, who has long feared putting his family under the harsh spotlight of a presidential campaign. During a two-minute encounter with reporters on Saturday morning, he grew irate, angrily insisting that he had never spoken with his son about any overseas work. “You should be looking at Trump,” Mr. Biden said. “Trump is doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum.” Even as they avoided mentioning Mr. Biden, other Democratic presidential candidates moved quickly to capitalize on the new dynamic in the race. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who rarely mentions Mr. Trump in her stump speech, opened her remarks at a cattle call on Saturday afternoon by excoriating both the president and congressional Democrats. “He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system,” she told a crowd of 1,200 cheering Democratic voters gathered in Des Moines for an afternoon of primary speeches. “It is time to call out this illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings right now.” Ms. Warren,  who first called for Mr. Trump to be impeached in April  after the release of Mr. Mueller’s report, went further on Friday, arguing on Twitter that by failing to act on impeachment,  Congress had become  “complicit in Trump’s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in U.S. elections.” Though he has yet to call for impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump — as have several of his rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination — Mr. Biden on Saturday tiptoed closer to embracing the  idea, which  has been gaining support on Capitol Hill despite opposition from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Mr. Biden, whose appearances on the campaign trail can be halting and sprinkled with misstatements, has generally delivered his  strongest performances  when focused on Mr. Trump. Speaking about the president allows Mr. Biden to discuss foreign policy and national security, issues that his campaign has said differentiate Mr. Biden, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, from the rest of the 2020 Democratic field. While  Mr. Trump’s attacks give Mr. Biden the one-on-one showdown with the president that his campaign has spent months trying to create, it also exposes him and his son to another round of questions about Hunter Biden’s business activities in Ukraine.  The Biden campaign moved quickly to warn the news media over the story, underscoring a deep concern about how allegations about the younger Mr. Biden’s work will be received by voters. “Any article, segment analysis and commentary that does not demonstrably state at the outset that there is no factual basis for Trump’s claim, and in fact that they are wholly discredited,  is misleading readers and viewers ,” said the deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, in an email to reporters. But Biden advisers also seized on the furor to portray Mr. Trump as fixated on, and worried about, a potential general election race against Mr. Biden.  “There is only one candidate the president is trying to get foreign governments to dig up bogus dirt on,” Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Mr. Biden, said. The   effort by the president and his team to shift the focus to Mr. Biden could boomerang, casting the Democratic front-runner as a sympathetic figure unfairly attacked with foreign help. It could just as easily mark a defining moment for Mr. Biden, a 76-year-old politician first elected to the Senate in 1972 and long accustomed to playing by the more genteel political rules of a different era. [ Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week? ] Donna Brazile, the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman who led the party through Hillary Clinton’s loss to Mr. Trump three years ago, said the exchange on Saturday “in many ways feels like 2016.” Just the prominent discussion of the actions of Mr. Biden and his son in Ukraine, regardless of the merits of the president’s accusations, has the potential to hurt Mr. Biden, Ms. Brazile said. “We’re basically creating a political  story, which right now is undermining Joe Biden , when I do believe the real focus should be getting the substance of the complaint out to the American people as soon as possible,” she said. On Saturday morning, Mr. Trump posted a video mash-up of TV news footage of stories about Mr. Biden’s son. “This is the real and only story,” the president wrote.  Citing the reports by journalists seemed contradictory given the president’s claim that the media had not reported on the issue. But the tweets signaled that Mr. Trump and his campaign organization would be doing as much as possible to sow doubt about Mr. Biden. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a Biden backer, said that no matter who emerges as the Democratic nominee in 2020, that person will face misinformation and slashing personal attacks by the president and his campaign. “You have any other nominee, Trump will do something comparable to try to disadvantage that nominee,” said Mr. Coons, as he walked with Mr. Biden into a Polk County Democratic Party event. “I don’t see anything about this story that is specific to Joe Biden.” So far, Mr. Biden’s rivals, nearly all of whom converged on Iowa this weekend, have been quick to assail Mr. Trump while avoiding commentary about how the president’s accusations against the Bidens would affect the Democratic nominating contest.  Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey , whose campaign manager on Friday released a memo stating he would have to drop out of the race if he failed to raise $1.7 million before the end of September, remarked that “this is not a partisan issue.” He and  former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas  reiterated their calls for Mr. Trump to be impeached. Even if Mr. Biden’s primary competitors don’t take direct aim, the perception of Mr. Biden’s son leveraging his connections cuts a stark contrast with two leading rivals, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders, who have centered their candidacies around a fierce populist message of rooting out corruption in Washington. It’s a message that worked in 2016 for Mr. Trump, who cast Ms. Clinton as the avatar of establishment self-dealing, a past-her-prime creature of Washington unable to adjust to the times and to produce real change. Mr. Biden’s team is acutely aware of that comparison. After Mr. Biden initially gave only a meager retort on the Ukraine issue Friday, his campaign decided to go further. Sensing an opportunity to highlight Mr. Trump’s fixation with Mr. Biden, his campaign released a statement in his name condemning the president for “abhorrent” conduct and demanding Mr. Trump release the transcript of his call with the Ukrainian leader and allow the director of national intelligence to release the whistle-blower’s claims to Congress. Advisers to Mr. Biden said his  initial reluctance  to comment reflected his prudence about discussing sensitive national security matters rather than unease with the work of his son in Ukraine.  But the former vice president is highly sensitive about questions regarding his family, and it was not until several outlets reported on what Mr. Trump said in the phone call last month that the Biden campaign determined it should try to go on the offensive.

"WASHINGTON — Senator  Bernie Sanders  on Tuesday unveiled a proposal to create a new tax on the wealth of the richest Americans, including a steep tax on billionaires that  could  greatly diminish their fortunes. With the proposal, Mr. Sanders is embracing an idea that has been a centerpiece of the campaign of his top progressive rival, Senator  Elizabeth Warren . But while Ms. Warren came first, Mr. Sanders is going bigger. His wealth tax would apply to a larger number of households, impose a higher top rate and raise more money. Mr. Sanders’s plan  to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires. His tax  would  cut in half  the  wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years,  according to two economists  who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan. Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the  housing plan he released last week  and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for “Medicare for all.” “Let me be very clear: As president of the United States, I will reduce the outrageous and grotesque and immoral level of income and wealth inequality,” Mr. Sanders said in an interview. “What we are trying to do is demand and implement a policy which significantly reduces income and wealth inequality in America by telling the wealthiest families in this country they cannot have so much wealth.” Asked if he thought billionaires should exist in the United States, Mr. Sanders said, “I hope the day comes when they don’t.” He added, “It’s not going to be tomorrow.” [ Sign up for our politics newsletter  and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] “ I don’t think that billionaires should exist ,” he said, adding that there would always be rich people and others with less money.   “This proposal does not eliminate billionaires, but it eliminates a lot of the wealth that billionaires have, and I think that’s exactly what we should be doing.” The proposal from Mr. Sanders is the latest sign of the push in the Democratic Party to collect substantially more revenue from the wealthiest Americans by rethinking how they are taxed — a move that  could  provide large sums of money to finance new social programs. And it is a significant development in the competition of ideas between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren,  the two leading progressive candidates in  the Democratic primary race . Democrats Want to Tax the Rich. Here’s How Those Plans Would Work (or Not). We break down the benefits and risks to the four main ideas that presidential candidates have embraced. Both of their plans would need to be passed by Congress in order to take effect — a virtual impossibility unless Democrats win control of the Senate in the 2020 elections, and far from a sure thing even then. Ms. Warren’s plan touched off a number of questions about the feasibility of  creating a wealth tax , including whether such a tax would be constitutional, how it would be enforced and whether it would generate as much money as has been projected. On Tuesday, Ms. Warren welcomed Mr. Sanders’s plan. “I’m delighted to see people talking about a wealth tax,” she  told WBUR . “I think it’s great because this is how we make big structural change in this economy. We need all of the presidential candidates talking about it; where are the rest of them?” Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, would create an annual tax that would apply to households with a net worth above $32 million — about 180,000 households in total, or about the top 0.1 percent, according to the economists who worked on the plan. He would impose a 1 percent tax on net worth  above $32 million , with increasing marginal rates topping out at 8 percent on net worth over $10 billion.  For single filers, the brackets would be halved, meaning the tax would kick in at $16 million. By contrast, the wealth tax proposed by Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, would apply to households with a net worth above $50 million — an estimated 70,000 households in total. The structure of her plan is simpler: She would apply a 2 percent tax on net worth from $50 million to $1 billion, and a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion. Unlike the Sanders plan, the tax brackets would be the same for married and single filers. Bernie Sanders’s wealth tax proposal $32 million to $50 million net worth: 1 percent marginal tax rate $50  million to $250 million: 2 percent  $250 million to $500 million: 3 percent  $500 million to $1 billion: 4 percent  $1 billion to $2.5 billion: 5 percent  $2.5 billion to $5 billion: 6 percent  $5 billion to $10 billion: 7 percent  Over $10 billion: 8 percent Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax proposal $50 million to $1 billion: 2 percent Over $1 billion: 3 percent  Note: The brackets shown for the Sanders proposal are for married filers; the brackets would be halved for single filers. The Warren proposal uses the same brackets for married and single filers. Mr. Sanders’s tax is projected to raise $4.35 trillion over a decade, while Ms. Warren’s is projected to raise $2.6 trillion over the same time period. Those estimates were produced by  Emmanuel Saez  and  Gabriel Zucman , two economists at the University of California, Berkeley, with whom both the Sanders and Warren campaigns consulted as they developed their proposals.  (The projection for Ms. Warren’s plan differs slightly from their  original estimate  of $2.75 trillion earlier this year.) “The Sanders plan is really pitched at the idea that we don’t want billionaires and decabillionaires to be billionaires and decabillionaires for as long as they currently are,” Mr. Saez said. “It’s going to erode their fortunes much faster than the Warren wealth tax.” Mr. Sanders included several steps in his plan to enforce the tax, including creating a “national wealth registry,” increasing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and requiring audits of many taxpayers who are subject to the wealth tax, including all billionaires. Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman calculated how the Warren and Sanders wealth taxes would have affected the fortunes of the richest Americans had each been in effect since 1982. The fortune of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder who Forbes said was worth $160 billion last year, would have been $87 billion under the Warren plan and $43 billion under the Sanders plan. Over all, the economists found, the cumulative wealth of the top 15 richest Americans in 2018 — amounting to $943 billion, using estimates from Forbes — would have been $434 billion under the Warren plan and $196 billion under the Sanders plan. Mr. Sanders is  hardly a newcomer to the idea of a wealth tax . In a 1997 book, he wrote that it was “time, high time, to establish a tax on wealth similar to those that exist in most European countries.” In 2017, he included a wealth tax on a  list of financing options  for Medicare for all. Ms. Warren  was quick to harness the idea  in the 2020 race. She released her wealth tax proposal in January, weeks before Mr. Sanders began his campaign. Since then, the proposal has become a cornerstone of Ms. Warren’s campaign and a fixture of her stump speech, even prompting chants of “Two cents!” from crowds. The money from her tax would go toward other policy plans she has issued, including her proposals for universal child care, student debt cancellation and tuition-free public college."

Following  President Trump 's comments that he did  nothing wrong  during a phone call with  Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy,  Rep. Peter King , R-N.Y., said during an interview on "" America's News HQ "" that the case raises ""constitutional issues"" about the commander-in-chief's privacy. ""I think this raises very, very serious constitutional issues,"" King said Sunday. ""I think it’s wrong as a general matter to have private conversations between the president of the United States, whether it’s  Donald Trump  or  Bernie Sanders  or  Elizabeth Warren  or anyone else -- those conversations, with a foreign leader, being somehow made public.""

""If it goes to Congress, it’ll be made public. This went on all during Russia,"" King added. ""It went to the Intelligence Committee -- then it was leaked to the New York Times... and it all turned out to be fake and to be false. But, the fact is, we can’t have the president of the United States, no matter who it is, being held hostage... even to the inspector general... This, to me, violates the separation of powers."" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif, had the opposite view and threatened to cut funding to the intel community if the contents of the call were not released. Trump fired back Sunday morning while speaking with reporters on his way to a rally in Houston, and maintained the call was above board.

"Giuliani's comments came in a heated exchange on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" as Chris Cuomo pressed the former New York mayor over conversations he'd had  with a Ukrainian official  about Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who had investigated the former vice president's son, Hunter. Giuliani has repeatedly pointed to the event as a scandal, even as other Western governments also called for that prosecutor's dismissal and no evidence has indicated Biden's move was inappropriate. That prosecutor was replaced by Yuriy Lutsenko, who would later drop an investigation into a company in which Hunter Biden was involved. ""Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?"" Cuomo asked Giuliani. ""No, actually I didn't. I asked the Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016 by the Ukrainians for the benefit of Hillary Clinton, for which there is already a court finding,"" Giuliani responded.  ""You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden and his role with the prosecutor?"" Cuomo asked.  ""The only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that Lutsenko, who was appointed, dismissed the case,"" Giuliani said.  ""So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?"" Cuomo pressed. ""Of course I did,"" Giuliani said.  When asked about his contradicting answer, Giuliani said he ""didn't ask"" for Biden to be investigated specifically, but asked Ukraine ""to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme."" Giuliani's remarks come the same day  The Washington Post  and  The New York Times  reported that a recent whistleblower complaint about Trump making a ""promise"" to a foreign leader involves Ukraine.  As CNN previously reported , the complaint has led to a standoff between Congress and acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who has refused to turn over the complaint to the House Intelligence Committee."

"'Fox News Sunday' anchor Chris Wallace reacts to Pelosi's formal impeachment inquiry announcement. ""Fox News Sunday"" anchor Chris Wallace weighed in on the formal impeachment inquiry being launched against  President Trump , insisting that the ongoing controversy surrounding his communications with Ukraine's leader puts ""a lot of meat on the bones"" of the process for House Democrats. ""I think that the most interesting aspect of this is, you know, we're talking a lot about what the whistleblower knew or didn't know firsthand ... but the fact is that President Trump and his staff have said quite a lot since Sunday in trying to explain or defend what they did that puts a lot of meat on the bones,"" Wallace told ""Special Report"" anchor Bret Baier. ""The fact is that the president says that in that introductory or in that congratulatory phone call with the president-elect at that time of Ukraine... He did talk about  Joe Biden  and his son and possible corruption and expressed some concerns about wanting the Ukrainian president to look into that."" Wallace then pointed to White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway's  remarks on ""Fox & Friends""  Tuesday morning confirming the report that Trump had asked Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to halt military aid to Ukraine prior to that July phone call. COMEY SAYS HE HOPES CONGRESS DOESN'T IMPEACH TRUMP: IT LETS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 'OFF THE HOOK' “Two parts of the basic story here -- that the president wanted Biden investigated, and that he had previously stopped aid that had been approved by Congress for Ukraine -- that those have been confirmed by the administration,"" Wallace continued. ""It may not bear fruit, but there is some meat on the bones here, both in terms of what the president said to the Ukrainian president and the actions that he had taken to stop aid before he made that call.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks to reporters following Speaker Pelosi's announcement on a formal impeachment inquiry. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ,D-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday that actions President Trump has already acknowledged render him eminently impeachable. “What is going on is that the president has committed several impeachable offenses. He, himself, what he has admitted to is already impeachable, regardless of future developments,” said Ocasio-Cortez. She referenced such things as emoluments and pushing for assistance from foreign governments.

The whistleblower said Trump told Zelensky that he would not release the aid unless he investigated Biden. A source familiar with the situation  has told  Fox News the whistleblower did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the phone call and Trump has agreed to release a transcript on Wednesday.

"Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, among President Trump’s staunchest defenders, has publicly — if gently —  called on  the president to “tell us as much as he can without compromising executive privilege, so that we can understand what happened.”  The senator is referring to a whistle-blower complaint with the inspector general of the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, detailing multiple concerning acts by Mr. Trump, including  inappropriate promises  he may have made to a foreign leader. In a radio interview on Monday, Mr. Graham  predicted  that “President Trump is going to blow you away with his willingness to disclose and be transparent about this phone call, because I think he did nothing wrong and he has nothing to hide.” Mr. Trump would be wise to listen to Mr. Graham. The president, who says he did nothing wrong, should welcome the opportunity to let Congress clear up this matter. Mr. Atkinson, a Trump appointee, found the complaint to be of “urgent concern and credible,” prompting him to alert the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire. Under federal  law , Mr. Maguire had a responsibility to deliver the inspector general’s findings to Congress within a week. Instead, the Department of Justice advised Mr. Maguire  not to pass along the report . Mr. Atkinson felt  compelled  to alert Congress to the existence, but not the contents, of the complaint. As subsequent reporting has revealed, among the whistle-blower’s core allegations is that Mr. Trump  pressured  a foreign government to take steps that would damage a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. In a July phone call with the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr. Trump is said to have  repeatedly  urged Mr. Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, on a corruption investigation of Mr. Biden, focused on the tenure of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter on the board of a Ukranian gas company. At issue is not whether Mr. Trump spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart about Mr. Biden or even whether he accused Mr. Biden of corruption. The president  acknowledged  as much on Sunday, when he told reporters, “The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in  the Ukraine.” This jibes with what Mr. Giuliani said — far more  combatively  — in a Thursday  interview  on CNN. Pressed on whether he had asked Ukrainian officials to look into Mr. Biden, Mr. Giuliani initially said no, then, upon further questioning, declared, “Of course I did!” Whatever the nature and impetus for Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani’s pressure campaign, it came at a delicate moment in relations between the United States and Ukraine, a former Soviet republic. This summer the Trump administration,  without  any  warning ,  temporarily held up $250 million in military aid  aimed at helping Ukraine defend itself against aggression by Russia. At the time, the administration said it was  reviewing the program  to make sure the money was being used in the best interest of the United States. The money was released this month,  the same week that  three House committees announced plans to look into whether Mr. Trump had pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rival and whether his administration had suggested, explicitly or implicitly, that the aid money was contingent on that help. This is a complicated situation, and there are serious questions begging to be cleared up. The White House has worked to prevent that from happening. By refusing to turn over the whistle-blower report, the administration is following the same playbook it has used for all of Congress’s inquiries: deny, deflect and delay — possibly indefinitely. This time, lawmakers seem disinclined to tolerate such presidential contempt. In  a letter  on Sunday  to fellow House Democrats , Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned, “If the administration persists in blocking this whistle-blower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.” Ms. Pelosi gave the administration a deadline of Thursday, when Mr. Maguire is set to appear before the House Intelligence Committee, to turn over the whistle-blower’s “full complaint” and to “establish a path for the whistle-blower to speak directly to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as required by law.” In addition to Mr. Graham, Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, called on Mr. Trump in a Sunday  tweet  to end the stonewalling: “If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out.” Critical indeed. This should not be a partisan issue. Lawmakers from both parties have an interest, and a duty, in making clear that any president, in accordance with the law, is accountable to Congress.

CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, President Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was  eventually released  after objections from the Senate. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. Biden said Friday that the claim has no credibility. Biden released a statement Friday criticizing Trump for the alleged phone call, demanding the president release a transcript and the whistleblower's complaint.

"It's the latest example of how Republicans are extremely reluctant to criticize the leader of their party even in the face of a growing controversy with many outstanding questions.  The tone was set by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, when he opened the chamber floor and blasted Democrats for what he said was a politicization of the issue before the facts were known.  McConnell also refused to tell reporters if he believed the formal whistleblower complaint that's  being held back by the administration  should be made available to Congress or if Trump was wrong to discuss with the Ukrainian President possible investigations of Joe and Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  ""Is it a whistleblower or is it a leaker, I don't know which,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of the GOP leadership and Intelligence Committee, who said the matter may fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice for prosecution, not Congress for oversight.  Cornyn sharply pushed back when a reporter questioned why the senator thinks the person who filed a complaint with the Intelligence Community's Inspector General is not an actual whistleblower.  ""What makes you think he is?"" Cornyn asked.  Even Sen. Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina who chairs the Intelligence Committee, which is taking the lead on unpacking the allegations for the Senate, suggested he's not sure if the charges involve the intelligence community. ""I don't even know if the complaint even deals with the Intelligence Community,"" he said before sides-stepping questions about the appropriateness of Trump pressing the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens.  ""Talk to him,"" is all Burr would say, referring to Trump.  Sen. Kevin Cramer, a Republican senator from North Dakota, downplayed the President's conversation with Ukraine's President. ""I think as is often the case, it's a lot of hysteria over very little,"" Cramer said. As did Sen. Chuck Grassley, the most senior GOP senator who has a long history of advocating for and protecting government whistleblowers.  When Grassley was asked about Trump acknowledging that he brought up Biden in a call with Ukraine's President, he responded by turning the focus to Biden, saying, ""What you're asking me, you could ask me the same question, was it appropriate what Biden did?"" Sen. Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who sits on the Intelligence Committee, said he doesn't think Trump ""should've done it"" when asked about the President's phone call urging Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.  ""I don't think he should've done it but that's a far cry from what some people around here are claiming to know as fact that frankly we don't know as fact,"" Rubio said, adding that people are talking about impeachment so much the term has ""lost all meaning."" Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican of Wisconsin who spoke to the President about why aid for Ukraine had not been appropriated yet for the upcoming year before visiting Ukraine earlier this summer, said Trump told him he was evaluating the funding because ""he was concerned about corruption."" Johnson said he believed that was a ""legitimate concern."" Connecticut Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, was asked if he is concerned some GOP senators will try to refer the whistleblower matter to the Justice Department for prosecution of a leaker of classified information:  ""This is an extraordinary moment. We're seeing our country turn into a banana republic. Republicans better be careful what they wish for because a Democratic president could use the same tools Donald Trump is to turn the White House into one big extension of his reelection campaign,"" Murphy said. ""If that's the direction they take, attacking the whistleblower, trying to coverup this corruption, it's a really, really said day for the country,"" he added."
"Sanders, a Vermont independent, has come under fire from a number of his 2020 Democratic presidential primary rivals over the cost of his plans, which would run into the trillions of dollars. While he has maintained that the wealthy would foot the bill for most of those proposals, Sanders has acknowledged that the middle class would see their taxes rise to pay for Medicare for All. He says that many Americans would still come out ahead because they would no longer pay premiums or out-of-pocket bills for health care. The new proposal was rolled out a day after  Bloomberg  reported that a polling firm associated with former Vice President Joe Biden had been studying which arguments against Medicare for All would be most effective with voters. One of its conclusions: the cost to taxpayers. Sanders responded to the news by insisting again that ""no one earning less than $29,000 will pay any new taxes"" under his plan, which he called ""a great deal for the American people."" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has already  unveiled plans to push for a similar wealth tax , which she often cites on the campaign trail -- to roaring approval from supporters -- as the potential source of funding for a series of ambitious programs. Sanders could be angling to establish a similar pitch, and respond to Biden, with a populist win-win proposal that pays for expensive new programs by soaking the rich. Under Sanders' ""tax on extreme wealth,"" married couples worth more than $32 million would pay a 1% tax on their wealth above that threshold. The rate would rise to 2% on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, climbing in increments to a 8% tax on wealth above $10 billion. The tax would be levied on single filers worth more than $16 million, with the top 8% rate assessed on their wealth above $5 billion. Sanders has long railed against the growth in income inequality in the US, noting that over the last 30 years, the top 1% has seen a $21 trillion increase in its net worth, while the bottom half has lost $900 billion in wealth.  ""We are going to take on the billionaire class, substantially reduce wealth inequality in America and stop our democracy from turning into a corrupt oligarchy,"" said Sanders, who earlier this year released a proposal that would expand the federal estate tax on the wealthiest 0.2% of Americans, imposing a top rate of 77% on estates worth more than $1 billion. His wealth tax, meanwhile, would hit the richest 180,000 households in US who are in the top 0.1%, according to the proposal. It would cut the wealth of billionaires in half over 15 years. The levy would raise $4.35 trillion over a decade, according to University of California Berkeley economics professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who analyzed the plan for the Sanders campaign. It would eliminate the gap in wealth growth between billionaires and the middle class. The professors, who are well known for their work on income inequality and taxing the rich, also evaluated  Warren's wealth tax proposal , which she released in January. Warren is calling for a 2% levy on wealth above $50 million, with an additional 1% tax on net worth above $1 billion. Saez and Zucman estimated her plan would raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years from about 75,000 households. Sanders would use the revenue raised from his tax to pay for his universal childcare proposal and his affordable housing plan, which calls for capping annual rent increases and investing in affordable housing.  His housing plan  is estimated to cost $2.5 trillion over a decade. It would also help fund Medicare for All, which independent experts have estimated could cost around $32 trillion over 10 years. Taxing wealth, however, could be very difficult to do. There are questions about whether it is permitted by the US Constitution, with legal scholars falling on both sides of the argument. Also, wealth taxes can be tough to administer since the rich often have assets that are hard to value. Sanders maintains a wealth tax is constitutional, and his proposal includes several enforcement mechanisms."

"President Trump addresses the press following meeting with prime minister of Singapore. President Trump  mocked  CNN anchor Chris Cuomo  by repeatedly referring to him as ""Fredo"" -- just weeks after a video of the host taking offense at being called that name went viral. During a bilateral meeting with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the United Nations on Monday, Trump took several questions about the whistleblower controversy involving his communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. His phone call with the Ukraine leader is alleged to have involved a potential investigation into Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President and 2020 frontrunner  Joe Biden . When specifically asked if he approved lawyer Rudy Giuliani's handling of the controversy in various interviews, the president singled out a clash the former New York City mayor had with Cuomo on CNN last week. ""I think he was excellent,"" Trump responded. ""I watched it the other night... I haven't watched that show in a long time. I don't watch CNN because it's fake news, but I watched Rudy take apart Fredo."" CNN'S CARL BERNSTEIN COMPARES TRUMP-UKRAINE STORY TO WATERGATE Trump's ""Fredo"" insult was in reference to an  August confrontation that went down between Cuomo and a heckler , who taunted the CNN anchor with a nickname drawn from ""The Godfather"" movies. Fredo referred to the weak-minded and suggestible brother of Michael Corleone. ""The press doesn't give [Giuliani] credit because they take little tiny snippets where Rudy was a little bit -- if he mispronounces a word, they'll show that and they won't show the whole,"" Trump continued. ""Rudy Giuliani took Fredo to the cleaners. The first time I've watched CNN in a very long time. So I hate to watch it because it's so fake."" Last month, a video posted online showed a man telling Cuomo, in regard to the Fredo tag, ""I thought that was who you were."" ""No, punk-ass b----es from the right call me 'Fredo.' My name is Chris Cuomo. I'm an anchor on CNN,"" a heated Cuomo responded. ""'Fredo' was from 'The Godfather.' He was a weak brother and they use that as an Italian slur -- are any of you Italian? It's a f---ing insult to your people. It's an insult to your f--kin' people. It's like the N-word for us. Is that a cool f---ing thing?"" CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO SEEN IN VIDEO LASHING OUT OVER 'FREDO' TAUNT After the man sarcastically told him, ""You’re a much more reasonable guy in person than you seem to be on television,"" Cuomo reacted, ""If you want to play, we'll f---ing play."" ""If you've got something to say about what I do on television, then say it, but you don't have to call me a f---in' insult,"" he continued. ""Hey man, listen, I don't want any problems,"" the man, who appears to be holding the camera from below, told Cuomo. ""Well, you're gonna have a big f---in' problem,"" Cuomo shot back. The man, who has been described on social media as a ""Trump supporter,"" repeatedly claimed he thought Cuomo's name was ""Fredo."" The anchor responded by calling him a ""liar"" and told him to ""own what you said"" and ""stand up like a man."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"
"Constitutional law attorney Jenna Ellis Rives on Democrats' reaction to President Trump allegedly asking Ukraine officials to investigate Joe Biden. CNN political correspondent and famed Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein compared the  Trump-Ukraine  story to… Watergate. Bernstein has been a staunch critic of President Trump and appeared on CNN’s liberal “Reliable Sources” on Sunday to offer his opinion on reports that a  whistleblower  may have accused the president of wrongdoing related to a July phone call with  Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE' Trump reportedly has been accused of asking Ukraine’s leader multiple times to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, and possibly using military aid as leverage. Trump denied making any improper requests – but that didn’t stop Bernstein from comparing it to Watergate. “If the reporting of Shane Harris and the Wall Street Journal is accurate, and it seems to be, it clearly moved toward a grievous abuse of power by the President of the United States. I keep getting asked, ‘Are there echoes of Watergate in this?’ There are in the following ways,” Bernstein said Sunday. “Watergate was very much an attempt by Richard Nixon to undermine the Democratic electoral process.” Bernstein said that Nixon used “political espionage and sabotage” to nominate George McGovern, who Nixon considered the “weakest candidate,” as opposed to Edmund Muskie. BIDEN FACES SCRUTINY FOR DEMANDING OUSTER OF UKRAINE OFFICIAL PROBING FIRM THAT EMPLOYED HIS SON Back in 1972, Bernstein and Bob Woodward reported that a White House aide fabricated a letter detailing Muskie condoning a racial slur against Americans of French-Canadian descent, which derailed his campaign. “Something of the same thing seems to be happening here where Biden, who Trump and his people have said they fear the most, in terms of being an opponent, has been the object of these, perhaps, dirty tricks,” Bernstein continued. ""One thing Nixon never did was engage a foreign power to investigate a candidate running for office in the United States. It is a grievous offense if this is what happened.” Bernstein, along with Woodward, helped take down President Nixon with Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the Watergate scandal in the Washington Post. Fox News’ Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report."
"Vice President Mike Pence sits down for an exclusive interview on 'Hannity.' Editor’s Note: The following is an excerpt from Andrew C. McCarthy’s new bestselling book, "" Ball of Collusion: The Plot to Rig and Election and Destroy a Presidency ."" The footnotes have been omitted. It is in connection with Paul Manafort that we encounter some genuine collusion targeting the 2016 campaign: willful collaboration among foreign governments, the  Obama administration , and the Clinton campaign. Just a week after the campaign introduced Carter Page as a  Trump  foreign policy adviser, it announced that Manafort had been brought on board, too. The consultant was an old political hand, experienced managing the rough-and-tumble of a convention fight. Manafort had longstanding, lucrative political consulting (and other business) arrangements with Ukrainian and Russian  oligarchs  who had Kremlin ties. These arrangements had already been spun into a narrative of political corruption in 2007 and 2008 by Glenn Simpson — then a Wall Street Journal scribe. In 2016, as the Fusion GPS impresario, Simpson would pull these articles off the shelf to help weave the Russia-gate tale. FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AS CAUCUS PLANS TO DISCUSS UKRAINE WHiSTLEBLOWER MATTER In February 2014, the Ukrainian Euromaidan uprising finally forced the flight to Moscow of Manafort’s client, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. With American attention intensifying as tensions boiled over in Kiev, Manafort reentered the FBI’s investigative cross-hairs, as did other American political consultants who did work that benefitted the Party of Regions. Yanukovych’s abdication delighted the Obama administration, which was quick to back the new administration of President Petro Poroshenko. Kiev became so dependent on Washington for desperately needed financial support that, by threatening to withhold funds, Vice President Joe Biden pressured Poroshenko into firing Viktor Shokin, one of his top prosecutors. Shokin just happened to be investigating a natural gas company called Burisma, which just happened to have placed Hunter Biden, the vice president’s son, on its board of directors. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER While the Veep pushed the International Monetary Fund to grant Ukraine a $17.5 billion loan package, Burisma lavishly compensated Hunter’s law firm, to the tune of more than $3 million over an eighteen-month span. A lot of money? Sure, but it’s chump change compared to the Chinese government’s $1.5 billion infusion in a joint investment fund with Hunter Biden while Vice President Biden, administration point-man on China issue, turned a blind eye to Beijing’s aggression in the South China Sea. Under the circumstances, it may seem ironic that the Obama administration prodded Ukraine to establish a National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) — but the IMF, like most progressive institutions, is duly impressed by such Orwellian titles. Naturally, the fledgling NABU developed a close-knit relationship with the FBI. In 2014, NABU alerted the bureau to a ledger said to have belonged to Yanukovych, bête noire of the new Ukrainian government. The ledger purports to show $12.7 million in cash payments to Manafort. The FBI used the information to interview Manafort, but the authenticity of the ledger has not been established. Manafort dismisses it as fake, contending that the Party of Regions paid him by wire transfer, not cash. Ukrainian officials have conceded that they cannot prove the payments reflected in the ledger were made. The case was thus reportedly closed with no charges. (Perhaps not coincidental to the Obama Justice Department’s decision not to pursue the case: Manafort had brought influential Democrats into his Ukrainian work, such as former Obama White House Counsel Greg Craig and the consulting firm started by Obama and Clinton adviser John Podesta — a firm that is still run by Podesta’s brother.) But then came 2016, and sudden renewed interest in the Manafort- Ukraine investigation … just as the U.S. presidential campaign kicked into high gear. Contrary to the media-Democrat collusion narrative, Manafort had pleaded with Yanukovych to chart Ukraine’s course toward the EU rather than Russia. It was the Ukrainian president’s rejection of this advice that sparked the protests and his flight to Moscow. Afterwards, Manafort busied himself by propping up a new Ukrainian political organization, the Opposition Bloc, to supplant the Party of Regions. That put Manafort on the radar screen of Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian-American and a DNC consultant who was all in for Hillary. Chalupa is said to have had an inkling that Manafort would become involved in the Trump campaign. Why she did is an interesting and thus far unanswered question. To be sure, if it was conjecture, it would have been sensible conjecture: a Ukrainian keeping tabs on Manafort would know he was a friend and former political consulting business partner of Roger Stone, who was himself vigorously supporting Trump’s bid. Manafort was itching to get back into the American political arena, and Trump’s steamrolling campaign would be a logical landing place. Chalupa also had good sources in Kiev who were focused on Manafort. These included Serhiy Leshchenko, a Ukrainian legislator opposed to Yanukovych’s Party of Regions and the Opposition Bloc, and Artem Sytnyk, NABU’s director. It was Sytnyk who took over and quietly closed the investigation of Burisma after Vice President Biden got Poroshenko to pink-slip the prosecutor. Leshchenko just happens to be a vassal of Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian billionaire who just happens to give millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. Wonder of wonders, Leshchenko took a public, strident anti-Trump position during the U.S. campaign — highly unusual for a foreign parliamentarian. “A Trump presidency would change the pro-Ukrainian agenda in American foreign policy,” he told the Financial Times, so it was “important to show not only the corruption aspect” of the mogul, but also that Trump was “a pro-Russian candidate who can break the geopo- litical balance in the world.” That, he added, was why most Ukrainian politicians were “on Hillary Clinton’s side.” (I’m sure she was thrilled about the enthusiasm in Kiev, but enthusiasm in Wisconsin might have been more helpful.) During the same early 2016 weeks when Chalupa was tapping her Ukrainian sources and giving Democrats a heads-up about a potential Manafort-Trump alliance, NABU investigators and Ukrainian prosecutors journeyed to Washington. There, the Obama administration arranged for them to huddle with the FBI, the Justice Department, the State Department, and the White House’s National Security Council (agencies that coordinated frequently throughout the collusion caper). Andrii Telizhenko, a political officer at Ukraine’s embassy in Washington, later told The Hill’s John Solomon that the U.S. officials uniformly stressed “how important it was that all of our anti-corruption efforts be united.” The officials also indicated to their Ukrainian counterparts that they were keen to revive the investigation of payments by Yanukovych’s ousted Party of Regions government to an American political consultant — i.e., the FBI’s Paul Manafort probe. I know this may be hard to believe, but the Obama officials seem to have been less interested in Greg Craig than in Manafort. Nazar Kholodnitskiy, Ukraine’s chief anti-corruption prosecutor, told Solomon that soon after the January 2016 Washington meetings, he found that Ukrainian officials were effectively meddling in the American presidential election. Another top Ukrainian lawman, Kostiantyn Kulyk, recalled that after the Kiev contingent’s return home from the United States, there was lots of buzz about helping the Americans with the Party of Regions investigation. Which brings us back to Serhiy Leshchenko, Ukraine’s unabashed Clinton backer. And whaddya know — besides serving the government in Kiev and providing scintillating geopolitical analysis, Leshchenko had a side job: he was a source for...wait for it...Fusion GPS — the Clinton campaign-opposition arm, led by Glenn Simpson, which later dreamed up the Steele dossier. Turns out it was Leshchenko (along with NABU chief Sytnyk) who leaked the unverified Yanukovych ledger to the media in May 2016, just after it was announced that Trump had made Manafort his campaign chairman. There is also a pending investigation into whether Leshchenko attempted to blackmail Manafort by sending text messages to the consultant and his daughter, threatening to give NABU, the FBI, and the media “bulletproof” evidence of Manafort’s financial dealings with Yanukovych. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The ledger’s exposure, of course, is what led to Manafort’s ouster as Donald Trump’s campaign chairman. The Ukrainian payments became an important strand of the Russia-gate narrative. The wealth that Manafort’s Ukrainian work generated formed the foundation of his prosecution by Special Counsel Mueller for tax, money laundering, and unregistered foreign-agent offenses. Can anyone say ""Clinton campaign collusion with Ukraine""? The Ukrainian courts can: In December 2018, one such tribunal ruled that Leshchenko and Sytnyk had violated Ukrainian law by leaking the ledger. The infraction, the court added, “led to interference in the electoral processes of the United States in 2016 and harmed the interests of Ukraine as a state.

"WASHINGTON — Bernie Sanders has long wanted to remake the health care system so no one will have to pay directly for medical care again. Now, he also wants to go back and cancel all the medical debts of people who have been billed under the current system. In a plan released Saturday, Mr. Sanders,  the Vermont senator and presidential candidate , proposes  wiping out  an estimated $81 billion in existing debt and changing rules around debt collection and bankruptcy. He also calls for replacing the giant credit reporting agencies with a “public credit registry” that would ignore medical debt when calculating credit scores. The proposals reflect Mr. Sanders’s concern that the medical system has placed financial hardships on too many Americans, by discouraging them from seeking needed medical care — but also by saddling them with expensive and unfair bills that can harm their financial security, ding their credit and, in some cases, lead to bankruptcy.  The plan  is Mr. Sanders’s latest effort to transform the health care system in America, a goal on which he has staked not just his second presidential run, but much of his political legacy. His proposal also separates him from other  presidential candidates : While several of them have come to embrace his “Medicare for all” plan to create a government-run health insurance system, he is the first top-tier contender to call for such drastic measures on medical debt.  “We’re addressing it on both ends,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re addressing it now by trying to help the people who have past due medical bills. And we’re addressing it by finally creating a health care system that guarantees coverage to people without any premiums, without any deductibles, without any out-of-pocket expenses.” [ Sign up for our politics newsletter  and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Medical debt affects Americans who lack health insurance, of course. But it is also  increasingly affecting people who have insurance  with holes, like high deductibles or  limited networks  of doctors whose care is paid for.  Around 16 percent of adults with credit reports have at least one medical debt,  according to  a study  published last year in the journal Health Affairs. The plan calls for the government to negotiate and cancel the debts, though it does not specify the precise mechanism. While eliminating every American’s medical debt would probably not come cheap, Mr. Sanders’s plan could wind up costing far less than the total amount of debt he is seeking to cancel. Craig Antico, a founder of the charity RIP Medical Debt, which buys and forgives medical debt,  estimated that the market price for $81 billion in debt could be as low as $500 million . Most past-due medical debt never gets paid, which is why bill collectors are often willing to sell the debts for pennies on the dollar. The plan would also create a public credit rating agency to “replace” for-profit companies like Equifax, and it would exclude medical debts from credit ratings. It would establish a new legal process, managed by the bankruptcy court system, to help adjudicate medical debts that are not yet in collections. Studies suggest that medical debts can be less damaging to people’s credit than other kinds of debt, in part because the credit reporting agencies treat people’s ability to pay medical bills as less predictive of creditworthiness than, say, their ability to pay credit card bills or car payments. And, despite the news media’s focus on particularly large medical bills, the typical bill in collections is less than $600, according to the Health Affairs article. But medical debts do affect credit somewhat, and they can cause psychological stress, beyond the financial consequences. A  survey  of people with medical debts  conducted by The New York Times  and the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2016 found that 44 percent of adults under 65 who had problems paying medical bills said those bills had a “major effect” on their lives. Fear of medical debts causes some people to avoid needed medical care. And medical bills can affect other parts of people’s finances that are harder to measure, showing up as an unpaid credit card bill or a missed loan payment. “I have a belief that if a plan like this could eliminate the debt that’s causing hardship, it could make a huge difference in people’s lives,” Mr. Antico said. The Sanders campaign circulated statistics suggesting that more than 500,000 Americans declare bankruptcy each year because of medical bills. That number, derived from  a survey of bankrupt individuals , overstates the impact of medical bills on bankruptcy. The study itself noted that health problems can cause bankruptcies in two ways, through direct medical bills and through lost income due to illness itself. The 500,000 figure includes both groups.  Other research has shown that  income losses due to illness are often the bigger financial hit than medical bills . Neither Mr. Sanders’s “Medicare for all” plan nor his medical debt program would address that secondary issue, though he has also called for guaranteeing workers paid medical leave.   The plan “is well targeted,” said Neale Mahoney, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, who studies medical debt. “It just may not be that much relief.” [ Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week? ] Mr. Sanders said that, in conversations with people around the country, he had come to see medical debt as the most consistent and visceral manifestation of a broken health care system.  At an event this month in Carson City, Nev., for instance, he heard  from a veteran  who said he had $139,000 in medical debt. When Mr. Sanders asked the man how he would pay off the debt, the man responded: “I can’t. I can’t. I’m going to kill myself.”  Those kinds of deeply moving moments, he said, drove him to seek a new way to ameliorate that particular pain as part of his overall vision for changing the health care system.  “I have always believed that health care is a human right, and it has always disturbed me immensely that so many of our people are uninsured or underinsured and can’t go to the doctor,” Mr. Sanders said. “But I have learned in this campaign something else, which I didn’t talk about previously, and that is the financial pain that this dysfunctional health care system is causing people.” The new plan is part of a burst of policy-related activity from the Sanders campaign, which also released  a housing plan last week  that included a proposal to establish a  national rent control standard . Margot Sanger-Katz reported from Washington, and Sydney Ember from New York."

"'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on why President Trump's handling of the latest showdown with Iran is drawing increased media criticism, especially from the likes of John Bolton and neocons. John Bolton had to know he was sending a message to the man who pushed him out of the White House. And a strong message it was, disagreeing with the president on just about every foreign policy hot spot. The recently departed national security adviser was speaking to a Manhattan luncheon for the Gatestone Institute, a conservative think tank he once chaired. About 60 people were gathered at Le Bernadin, including such hotshots as Alan Dershowitz, former attorney general Michael Mukasey and Newsmax chief Chris Ruddy. So the leak, in this case to Politico, was inevitable. The former Fox News contributor certainly gets that any words uttered before such a large audience will soon find their way into print. SIZE MATTERS? MEDIA PRAISE ELIZABETH WARREN -- AND HER CROWDS What’s fascinating here is that the Bolton broadside comes as Trump’s handling of the latest showdown with Iran is drawing increasing media criticism, especially from the right. The president is essentially in a no-win situation, whether he chooses a military strike against Iran or sticks with diplomacy and sanctions. The neocon wing of the GOP wants him to retaliate for the attack on Saudi oil facilities that our intel agencies are blaming on Iran, and is casting his reluctance as a sign of weakness. Bolton told the luncheon that any negotiations were Iran (and North Korea) are “doomed to failure,”  according to Politico. “Bolton also said more than once that Trump’s failure to respond to the Iranian attack on an American drone earlier this summer set the stage for the Islamic Republic’s aggression in recent months…Bolton said the planned response had gone through the full process and everybody in the White House had agreed on the retaliatory strike. But ‘a high authority, at the very last minute,’ without telling anyone, decided not to do it.” Reporters quickly asked Trump for his response. “John was not able to work with anybody, and a lot of people disagreed with his ideas,” he said. “A lot of people were very critical that I brought him on in the first place because of the fact that he was so in favor of going into the Middle East, and he got stuck in quicksand and we became policemen for the Middle East. It’s ridiculous.” SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES The president was referring to the Iraq war and Bolton’s role in the Bush administration. Trump ran against that war, and endless wars, and obviously wants to get out of Afghanistan. The neocons are growing more critical of Trump’s reluctance to pull the trigger in these situations. He even got into a little spat with his pal Lindsey Graham, who said, like Bolton, that the president’s failure to strike back after Iran downed an American drone is what paved the way for the attack that cut Saudi oil production in half. The Beltway press, as part of an establishment whose kids are rarely sent off to fight, often reflects these pro-war instincts. Iraq, you’ll recall, was going to be a cakewalk. Bret Stephens, a conservative  New York Times  columnist who detests the president, wrote yesterday that Trump’s policy is “locked, half-cocked, and probably bluffing.” He said this president combines “the rhetorical impulses of Bob Dornan with the strategic instincts of Dennis Kucinich.” Trump does like to talk tough with foreign adversaries. And obviously he has ordered airstrikes before. But it’s no accident that he threatened to incinerate North Korea and wound up in a pen pal relationship with Kim Jong-un. And yet if he keeps turning to sanctions and diplomacy, does there come a point where he looks like Barack Obama and his Syrian red line? Trump is bound to disappoint the neocons by exercising restraint when it comes to military options, knowing full well that there are unintended consequences that could bog down U.S. troops for years to come. That means he’s likely to face continued criticism from John Bolton, but might be in tune with the war-weary portion of the country."
"The question facing House Democrats of whether to impeach  President Trump  should not be answered based on poll numbers, Fox News contributor Sol Wisenberg argued Tuesday on  ""America's Newsroom."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was set to meet Tuesday with fellow House Democrats to discuss whether to move forward with an impeachment inquiry in the wake of the  Ukrainian whistleblower controversy . Wisenberg said if Democrats believe Trump has crossed the line, then questions about the potential political fallout must take a backseat. SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL ""They should ignore the polls and do what they think is right. Impeachment is a solemn matter to be deliberated upon and I think they've been looking at the polls too much,"" the former independent counsel said. ""Whether or not there are grounds for impeachment is a different matter. If you believe there are grounds for impeachment, don't look at the polls, don't worry about how it'll affect the election, move forward."" Wisenberg said he would give the same advice to either party and is not advocating that impeachment would be the right course of action in this instance. ""[Impeachment] is not an easy task in the best of circumstances and I don't think they're gonna have an easy road of it, but my God, they should try to do the right thing,"" he said. UKRAINE CONTROVERSY TURNS INTO DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR BIDEN The push for  impeachment  has picked up steam in recent days, including from  Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., in response to a whistleblower complaint that reportedly alleged Trump pressured the  Ukrainian  president to investigate  Joe Biden  and his son, Hunter Biden. ""The House must impeach. It must start today,"" Warren tweeted Tuesday morning. In addition, a slew of key swing-district Democrats  threw their support  en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as  The New York Times ,  The Washington Post  and  The Wall Street Journal  reported Monday that Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Multiple administration sources  confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that the Office of Management and Budget indeed told the State Department and Department of Defense  in July that it was putting a hold on the aid to Ukraine. But administration sources told Fox News that the reason for the freeze was tied to concerns about corruption. The rapid-fire support for an impeachment investigation by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after Pelosi  strongly suggested  she was now warming to the idea."
"The Steak Fry marks just the latest event in the  first-in-the-nation caucus state  where candidates will pitch themselves as the best contender to take on President Donald Trump.  With less than five months to go until the February 3, 2020, caucuses, candidates are putting an increased focus on the state -- and dusting off some dance moves -- in hopes Iowa voters will bolster their campaigns in a crowded Democratic primary field.  Sen. Kamala Harris of California,  who is looking to reframe her stagnating campaign by setting high expectations in Iowa , made her Steak Fry entrance alongside a marching drumline: Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who captured 2% support in Iowa in a September  CBS/YouGov Iowa poll , put on a similarly energetic display: And while Klobuchar has hit Trump's policies as ""all foam, no beer"" on the campaign trial, she said her beer on Saturday was just the opposite.  ""All beer, no foam,"" she said, beverage in hand.  Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro put less emphasis on his own moves and more focus on the mariachi band that accompanied his entrance.  ""Brought our own flavor to the #SteakFry,"" he tweeted Saturday."
"Now Ukraine has become wrapped in the Trump presidency's many subplots: the role of Russia and President Vladimir Putin, the legacy of Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, Trump's reelection outlook and a loose network of advisers not always operating in concert. The result is renewed focus on a country Trump once sought to tune out but where he now sees a political opportunity. His approach to Ukraine melds political and national security concerns fanned by some of his closest advisers. Trump has raised the issue involving the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden repeatedly in private conversations and believes there is a political opportunity in further probing the matter, the people familiar with the matter said. He's been urged along by his private attorney,  Rudy Giuliani, who told CNN on Thursday evening  that he'd pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son. Giuliani has maintained that he has been acting on his own and not at the direction of the President as he meets with Ukrainian officials. But Giuliani is aware that the issue has gotten Trump's attention, according to the people familiar with the situation. And Trump has raised it multiple times, in person and on the phone.  A source close to the White House who is familiar with Trump's comments said the President has been seething for months about Ukraine and Biden. The source described Trump as ""angry"" about what he sees as a liability for the former vice president. The source also said Giuliani has been ""egging him on."" Trump told reporters on Friday that ""somebody ought to look into"" the Biden matter, and said that ""it doesn't matter what I discussed"" during a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. CNN reported on Friday that in that call,  Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden's son . Trump is due to meet next Wednesday with Zelensky in New York. Trump was not initially interested in meeting with Zelensky or engaging with him, viewing him as an extension of the country's previous leader, President Petro Poroshenko. Trump believed Ukraine was a corrupt country that wasn't committed to reform, according to people familiar with his thinking at the time. The phone call and meeting come after months of back and forth between Trump and his advisers, who have worked to convince him that engaging the new Ukrainian leader is worth his time and effort for national security reasons. The country's attacks on Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, with accusations of him laundering money with offshore accounts, were the ultimate foundation for the President's beliefs.  Trump also consistently cast Ukraine -- a portion of which was annexed by Russia in 2014 -- as a messy situation created by his predecessor that he was unenthusiastic about wading into himself. ""He had never been concerned or interested in Ukraine,"" one person familiar with Trump's thinking said.  ""Obama lost it,"" was Trump's view, the person said, adding that the President always seemed ""more interested in engaging Putin than Zelensky.""  Trump's ties to Putin have been heavily scrutinized, and he's been accused of showing deference to the Russian leader. He's also remained fixated on Obama, frequently seeking to unravel his legacy. That lack of interest in Ukraine appeared to shift over the summer, when some of Trump's national security advisers worked to convince him that engaging Ukraine's new leader would benefit US national security interests. Though Trump continued to remain skeptical, he told his advisers he was open to being convinced of further engagement.  Then-national security adviser John Bolton and other senior Trump administration officials invited Oleksandr Danylyuk, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, to Washington for meetings in early July. They went well, and the White House saw it as a ""sign of encouragement"" to nudge Trump toward working with Ukraine.  The renewed engagement happened to dovetail with Giuliani's efforts to convince Ukrainian officials to look into Biden and his son -- an effort Giuliani spoke about publicly and that quickly caught Trump's attention. Even before Zelensky took office, Giuliani made known he was looking to set up a meeting to discuss an investigation into Burisma, the natural gas company where Biden's son Hunter had served on the board of directors. Giuliani's meetings occurred over the summer, just as US administration officials were working to spark Trump's interest in Ukraine. The parallel efforts seemed to be the launchpad for convincing Trump to engage with Ukraine more robustly. Three weeks later, Trump spoke by phone with Zelensky for the first time, in a call that is now under intense scrutiny for its potential role in the  whistleblower's complaint . Later, aides worked to arrange a meeting in Poland, though Trump ultimately did not make the trip because of a hurricane in the United States. People familiar with the matter said Bolton and the other US officials who met with Danylyuk in early July did not discuss the Biden matter. But the issue was known, and colored the talks. ""That was a bizarre situation, but it all seemed to be dealt with in Giuliani track,"" a person familiar with the meetings said. ""It was out there, but it was being handled by Giuliani. We did not deal with that because he [Giuliani] was talking about it and saying he was a private citizen."" At the same time, the administration begin reviewing $250 million in foreign aid to Ukraine, initially placing a hold on the package that angered some in Congress. The issue provided another wedge between Bolton, who was an advocate for the aid, and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who pushed for the package to be reviewed.  The money was released last week . It's not known how, if at all, the foreign aid was related to the Biden matter. And a person familiar with the situation said Friday that Trump had not discussed the pending aid package during the July 25 call with Zelensky. But even before this week's revelations about the intelligence whistleblower, Democrats in Congress had accused the administration of engaging in a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government. Through it all, Trump's interactions and meetings on Ukraine have been treated with special sensitivity within the administration. The State Department never got extensive readouts of his calls. And few people within the administration learned precisely what was discussed. ""There was concern about leaks,"" one person said of the tight hold on information."
"  The UN General Assembly is always a high stakes event for national security, but this year's gathering will take place amid rising tensions with Iran, a nuclearizing North Korea, the degradation of the global nonproliferation agenda, ongoing humanitarian crises and more.      And the UNGA already has a dark cloud hanging over it. As world leaders descend on New York City, they are already well aware of the urgent whistleblower complaint, lodged by a member of the intelligence community, concerning at least one of President Trump's communications with a foreign leader as well as Trump's own admission that he discussed Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Sunday,  the President said , ""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption).""    These world leaders may be convinced Trump is more concerned about his own political standing than the security of the American people. This waters down the credibility of any US national security work as our peers wonder whose interests the President and his team are really serving: America's or Trump's.      Trading places The United States has often been a champion for promoting the rule of law and anti-corruption around the world, including through the UN.  The concept of the rule of law is even embedded in the  UN charter  -- and through the  State Department  and other US government entities we have programs focused on advancing it overseas.  However, our ability to advance rule of law and anti-corruption initiatives globally takes a direct hit when the President is viewed as a poster child for the kind of actions we're trying to get other countries to stop doing.   President Trump reportedly pressed Ukraine's President Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son,  a source told CNN . And Rudy Giuliani confirmed that he also asked the Ukrainian government to investigate the former Vice President, even though there is no evidence of wrongdoing from either Joe Biden or his son Hunter.    This  news only bolsters the idea that the President is abusing his power to engage in self-dealing. Allegations of nepotism,  emoluments violations , channeling business to  Trump properties  and more have already painted a picture of a President doggedly pursuing self-interest.  Taken with new allegations of self-dealing and abuses of power, other leaders may now need to include anti-corruption talking points on their agenda when meeting with President Trump.    We have urgent business with Ukraine, including helping them to deter Russian aggression. Instead, because of the President's reported actions, the meeting may be overshadowed by the whistleblower complaint, Giuliani's efforts, and getting the story straight on their last phone call.  Ukraine has already been roped into this domestic US issue. Their Foreign Minister  issued a statement  saying that Zelensky didn't feel pressured and that Ukraine is an independent state. Zelensky and his team are trying to walk a fine line between keeping the President happy (they must know his ire has consequences ), without drowning in his political hot water. Fighting Trump's battles is likely not a priority for Zelensky. He has real ones of his own -- including an  ongoing armed conflict  with Russia -- going on at home.    This dark cloud of potential conflicts of interest and abuse of power will likely carry over into other meetings as well, like the President's meetings with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Polish President Andrzej Duda, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.      Even before the whistleblower complaint and the administration's decision to freeze security assistance to Ukraine earlier this year, world leaders were aware that  Trump is willing to cut off foreign assistance  to countries who won't (or can't) do his bidding. The idea that the President relies on explicit or implicit quid pro quos to score political wins has only been bolstered by recent events. Foreign leaders now have good reason to wonder whether incoming Trump requests are campaign 2020 calls or actually have to do with national security.    Fairweather fan    While Trump's bilateral meetings at the UNGA this week will be critical, his approach to the United Nations itself may indicate that he's a fairweather fan of the United Nations.   Even before he assumed office, President Trump had railed against the United Nations, saying it was "" not a friend of democracy ,"" and as President-elect he said the UN was causing problems and would be a waste of time and money if it didn't live up to its potential.  With his America First agenda, Trump's preferred not to play with others -- he's not a fan of coordinating with other countries through international institutions. He's withdrawn from  some UN entities  and  cut US funding to others . Trump's 2019 budget request even proposed cutting voluntary  US funding to UNICEF . His  UNGA remarks  last year even included a statement that ""America will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance, control, and domination.""   This year, the President may need to turn to the UN for support. While the formal UN agenda includes a host of topics that the President doesn't like -- including  climate change and sustainable development  -- he's probably going to try to get other member states to focus on what's top of mind for him, like  reports  that Iran was behind the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, after several months of  illegal activities in international waters, and a host of other malign activities. Iran's increasingly aggressive behavior will likely be a key topic for Trump in both public and private discussions.       The administration recently rolled out new  sanctions against Iran  and announced the deployment of more US forces to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But these actions would benefit from UN backing.  We've already cut off most transactions with Iran and these unilateral US sanctions probably won't have a lot of bite unless we're willing to punish foreign entities and individuals who violate our new sanctions or the UN passes similar ones. So making a compelling case about Iran's activities at the UNGA may be on top of Trump's to-do list.    Odd man out     While he's seeking to convince his global peers about the threat from Iran, Trump will probably try to water down their focus on another malign actor: North Korea.     North Korea conducted several  missile tests  over the last few months  -- a sign of its advancing arsenal -- and experts say its nuclear stockpile is expanding.  Trump's former National Security Adviser John Bolton said that North Korea's missile tests  violate UN Security Council resolutions , but Trump still  downplayed the missile tests . His stance on North Korea will likely be at loggerheads with that of our allies at the UN and will add to the general perception that there is no coherence when it comes to Trump's approach to rogue regimes.      While North Korea said that it welcomes a "" new method "" of talks with the US, denuclearization discussions remain stalled. Meanwhile, Trump argues that Kim "" likes testing missiles "" and he'll probably use his time at UNGA  to make the case that Kim deserves special treatment in the eyes of the international community. While many of our allies are concerned about North Korea's advancing illegal capabilities, Trump's the odd man out. Perceptions that his national security strategy is irregular and incoherent at best -- and more likely driven by naked self-interest -- will continue to proliferate"
"Senate Minority Leader Schumer says it is the Senate's duty to take the 'national security matter seriously'; chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge reports from Washington. The escalating controversy over  President Trump’s  phone conversation with  Ukraine’s president  has ignited a battle on Capitol Hill over Democrats’ demands for a copy of the whistleblower complaint against Trump, as some liberal lawmakers threatened subpoenas while Republicans called for restraint while they gather facts. Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate dealings involving 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, citing those claims to revive calls for impeachment. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, but Democrats have been moving full steam ahead, calling for the whistleblower complaint to be released to lawmakers. SOURCE SAYS WHISTLEBLOWER DIDN'T HAVE ‘FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE’ OF TRUMP CALL WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT “The Senate Republican ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ attitude is unacceptable and must change,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Senate floor Monday. “This again is an issue of solemn obligation. There is no wiggle room here, none.” The New York Democrat earlier in the day wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asking him to issue a subpoena and hold hearings over the complaint. In a floor speech Monday afternoon, the Kentucky Republican rebuffed those calls from Democrats, saying the Senate Intelligence Committee has been following an established process and was working to hear from the intelligence community's inspector general this week. “It is regrettable that House Intelligence Committee Chairman [Adam] Schiff and Sen. Schumer have chosen to politicize the issue,” McConnell said, calling for looking into the matter in an “appropriate, deliberate bipartisan manner.” In a statement Monday, Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley called for lawmakers not to rush to judgment. “One thing we do know is that rampant speculation by politicians and the media is not helpful,” he said. “That’s how the false Russia collusion narrative took root.” He added: “Let’s not repeat the mistakes of the past. Going forward, it’s important to respect the law and the whistleblower’s confidentiality while we gather the facts of the case. And of course, transparency is always the best policy so long as we don’t endanger national security.” On Wednesday, Democrats chairing three House committees sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking the department to produce documents related to the complaint, or face subpoenas. “Seeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution, which the President is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend,” the chairmen wrote. “Yet the President and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election.” The letter was sent by Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel of New York and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland. At least one Republican lawmaker, however, has called for the release of the transcript. “At this stage, given the seriousness of the allegations, it’s very important that the transcript and potentially as well the whistleblower come forward,"" said Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, an occasional Trump critic. Meanwhile,  a source told Fox News  on Monday that the whistleblower who sparked the complaint did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the conversation. The source said that it was made clear  in the complaint itself that the whistleblower  did not have direct knowledge of the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky. Fox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials would be on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower was not one of those people. It's unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation or learned of it another way. These new details have fed into skepticism about the allegations from Trump’s allies in Congress, with some likening it to how Democrats  rushed to call for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s impeachment  last week. Some Democrats backed off after The New York Times amended an explosive article on new college-era allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh to make clear that the alleged victim did not have any recollection of the alleged episode. On Fox News’  “Outnumbered Overtime,”  GOP Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah on Monday likened the two situations and called for restraint regarding the whistleblower complaint. “I think it’s fair to just take a breath, and say let's just find out the facts and see what happens,” he said. Without full knowledge of the facts, Democratic calls to impeach President Trump over the whistleblower complaint have no credibility, says Utah Congressman Chris Stewart, Republican member of House Intelligence Committee. Republicans also have been trying to return the focus to Biden. Trump allies have claimed son Hunter improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioned whether his father, the onetime vice president, helped protect him by seeking the ouster of prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was looking into the company's owner. Trump, in a Sunday night tweet, said the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin. Burisma hired Hunter Biden in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted amid protests and as his father was involved heavily in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Two years later, Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless Shokin was fired. Many critics in Ukraine and the West had accused Shokin of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner. Fox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But, the controversy flew largely under the radar until last week. While the heat has been on Trump over whether he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context. Fox News’ Chad Pergram, Jason Donner, Jake Gibson, Ronn Blitzer and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is surging and has a real ground game in Iowa, says Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier, anchor of 'Special Report.' As she surges in the latest national and early voting state polls, Democratic presidential candidate  Sen. Elizabeth Warren  is making a major television and digital ad buy to spread her message to potential primary voters. Warren’s presidential campaign announced on Tuesday that the populist  Democratic senator from Massachusetts , who’s released one progressive policy proposal after another through the primary campaign, will spend eight figures – or at least $10 million – to place spots on TV and on-line in  Iowa ,  New Hampshire ,  Nevada , and  South Carolina. Those are  the first four states to vote on the primary and caucus calendar. WARREN SURGING IN NEW 2020 POLLS IN NH, NEVADA, IOWA  “Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,” Warren campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in an email to supporters.  Lau explained that  spots “will be more digital than old-school broadcast television, and we have built an in-house staff to produce videos and ads rather than adopt the consultant-driven approach of other campaigns (and the big commissions and fees that come along with it).” The Warren campaign confirmed to Fox News that the digital ads would start running immediately, and that they’re currently reserving time for the TV commercials. Officials said the buy would last for several months. The Warren campaign released three of the ads on Tuesday – 15-second, 30-second and one-minute spots. “Take any of our big problems – health care, climate change, gun violence. Corruption is at the root of why our government won’t act,” Warren says  in the 15-second ad.  “I know what’s wrong. I know how to fix it. And I’ll fight to get it done.” SANDERS UPS THE ANTE WITH WEALTH TAX HIGHER THAN WARREN'S PLAN Lau also announced the campaign is continuing to expand its staffing. While Warren already has a formidable team in the four early-voting states, Lau spoke of  "" hiring state directors and organizers in a number of states that have primaries and caucuses in March. And we're targeting our resources to invest in places that will be critical to keeping the House, taking back the U.S. Senate and regaining ground in key state legislatures in 2020.” The $10 million ad buy and the expansion of campaign staff suggest that Warren’s fundraising remains strong. After a slow start earlier in the year, the senator hauled in over $19 million in the April-June second quarter of fundraising. "
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set to meet with House Democrats as President Trump defends handling of Ukraine aid; insight from Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, Democrat from Michigan. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich. told Fox News Tuesday that she supports an impeachment investigation of  President Trump  over  events surrounding a phone call  involving the president of Ukraine because ""we cannot be divided on following the rule of law."" FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AMID BOMBSHELL REPORTS TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE AID A growing number of  House Democrats have supported an impeachment probe  against Trump after it was revealed that the administration froze $400 million in aid to Ukraine shortly before the president allegedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The president said Tuesday that he would release an unredacted transcript of the phone call. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CLAIMS UKRAINE AID WAS STALLED OVER CORRUPTION CONCERNS, DECRIES MEDIA ‘FRENZY’ Dingell told  Fox News’ ""Outnumbered Overtime”  that if Trump did not make investigating Biden a condition of releasing the aid, then why did the White House block it being provided to the two intelligence committees?” 
 “Now we get information that the Inspector General for Homeland Security determined that there was a real credible threat to our national security,” she added. Dingell's endorsement of an impeachment inquiry marks a change for the third-term congresswoman. In March, she told "" Fox News Sunday "" that "" I do not think an impeachment should ever be a partisan event. I think we need to have Republicans and Democrats or it will tear this country apart. It's a very serious movement."" Administration sources told Fox News that the freeze on Ukrainian aid was tied to concerns about corruption. Those sources said that Trump wanted to be confident that the incoming Zelensky administration was going to take steps to end corruption before releasing the funding.

"Then along came Donald Trump, who gave both prominent jobs.  And last week, former White House Press Secretary Spicer was twirling in a lime-green ruffled shirt, dancing with the stars. And former Trump campaign manager Lewandowski, defiant in a red tie and jacket, was tangling with and frustrating the House Judiciary Committee's Democrats in a hearing that many could only label absurd.   Spicer's much-hyped re-emergence was not okay, wrote  Anushay Hossain , and she wasn't referring to his dance moves.  ""Sean Spicer's entire claim to fame (or infamy) comes from lying for a president who uses his office to lie, to side with dictators, to defend men who abuse women and work for him, to separate families, to stand up for white nationalism and much, much worse.  Spicer lied for a liar for a living. ""  Lewandowski, who's considering a run for a US Senate seat in New Hampshire, got an equally bad review from legal analyst  Elie Honig : "" Lewandowski was a truly horrible witness.  His demeanor was the stuff of a trial lawyer's nightmares. He was angry, combative, sarcastic, and more intent on getting off personal insults and pumping up his impending Senate campaign than actually answering questions or getting Congress or the public any closer to truth.""  Writing about the Lewandowski hearing in the Washington Post,  Harry Litman  warned, ""We may have just gotten a living glimpse of the way President Trump will continue  to distort and darken our politics long after he himself has left the scene ."" Then there's Rudy Giuliani.  The former New York City mayor actually had a national reputation before his immersion in Trumpworld, but has added a new cast to it. In a contentious interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo about an intelligence whistleblower allegation, wrote  Michael D'Antonio , "" Trump's personal lawyer and TV attack dog...both denied and confirmed  that the controversy may have to do with the fact that Giuliani has urged Ukrainian officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden."" (There's no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.) In a July call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump repeatedly suggested working with Giuliani on such an investigation, according to the Wall Street Journal. Zelensky may have a lot to gain from good relations with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. That, wrote  David Andelman , raises a ""key question: will Ukraine's new president calculate that he can win big points with the Kremlin  by giving a little help to Trump, Giuliani and their campaign  from more than 5,000 miles away?"" The Ukraine matter seemed to be at the heart of the striking new fissure in Trump's relationship with intelligence agencies.  Frida Ghitis  asked, ""What exactly could President Donald Trump have done that...drove a US intelligence official to file a formal whistleblower complaint over communications between Trump and an unidentified foreign leader...?""  She added, ""we have encountered another secret in a presidency that has been defined by obfuscation and falsehoods...  what is Trump hiding? ""  This could be seen as a warning to Trump's 2020 political rivals. In fact, Democrats should be ready for a race unlike anything they've seen before, wrote  Julian Zelizer . Now, ""Trump has the power of the presidency behind him. With that power comes  the potential for the administration to unleash damaging investigations  in the middle of the campaign that will put the Democrats on defense.""   The A team is long gone Now that generals James Mattis, John Kelly and H.R. McMaster have left the administration, along with CEOs Gary Cohn and Rex Tillerson, the President has ""surrounded himself with yes-men and is running his Cabinet like he used to run his real estate company --  as a one-man show surrounded by flunkies ,"" wrote  Peter Bergen . Trump's selection of Robert O'Brien, the State Department's chief hostage negotiator, as national security adviser last week fits right in, Bergen observed.  One of the first things on O'Brien's agenda is how to respond to the attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, which the Trump administration blamed on Iran.  Trump and his team have said many times that the President was willing to meet with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani with no preconditions -- but last Sunday Trump tweeted that was ""fake news."" It must be ""amnesia,"" Bergen noted. "" Trump's posturing back and forth between aggression and conciliation  might work for a real estate deal in Manhattan, but it's quite confusing and the stakes are also much higher when you are dealing with the complex calculations of a major regional power such as Iran.""

One of them, 19-year-old  Katie Eder  wrote, ""we're striking for a Green New Deal; for the immediate cessation of fossil-fuel projects on sovereign indigenous land; for environmental justice; for the protection and restoration of nature; and for sustainable agriculture. We're striking for ourselves, for our friends and family, for the kid who lives down the street from us.  We're striking because it's what we have to do. "" Good for them, wrote  David Gergen  and  James Piltch . Like the Parkland students and the civil rights protesters of the 1960s, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is leading a movement of conscience, one that contrasts with the do-nothing attitudes of many of their elders. ""At least once before, a children's movement was a core inspiration for our country to address its greatest injustices,"" Gergen and Piltch wrote.  ""Today, the young speak with moral clarity again."" Kavanaugh redux The controversy over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh resurfaced in a big way with the publication of a piece in the New York Times opinion section drawing on a new book by two of the newspaper's reporters. There was something for all sides to focus on.  The book,  Jill Filipovic  wrote, ""explores and corroborates previously under-reported claims by Kavanaugh's Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez that when she was a student, Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face as a joke. According to news reports, the FBI never fully investigated her claims, nor interviewed the people who reached out to them to corroborate. Thanks to constraints put in place by the White House, sources told CNN, the FBI also never interviewed Christine Blasey Ford, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, nor Kavanaugh himself.  The 'investigation' was a sham, and the Trump administration made it that way .""  The Times came in for withering criticism for its handling of the piece, since -- while it described an additional allegation against Kavanaugh -- it failed to point out that the woman allegedly involved did not remember the incident, according to her friends, and declined to speak to reporters (The Times added an editor's note with those points after the piece was originally published). The Washington Post's  Kathleen Parker  wrote, ""The recent fiasco at the New York Times, which last weekend published the latest uncorroborated sexual assault accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh,  was a monument to hearsay and a travesty of journalistic ethics. "" Also in the Post,  Marc Thiessen  welcomed the call by some Democrats to impeach Kavanaugh: ""As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose. In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Brett Kavanaugh or liberal court packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should.  So, let the impeachment proceedings begin ."" Elie Honig  blasted President Trump's tweet urging the Justice Department to ""rescue"" Kavanaugh from the allegations. That's definitely not its role, wrote Honig. Still, the calls for impeachment are futile: "" Kavanaugh almost certainly is not going anywhere ... He likely will sit on the Supreme Court for decades to come, certainly for as long as he wishes. But Kavanaugh's deeply flawed confirmation process should stand as a reminder of the danger of turning the Justice Department, long fearless and proudly independent, into an institutional political operative."" The short SNL career of Shane Gillis Days after Saturday Night Live announced that comedian Shane Gillis would be joining its cast, the show fired him for what it called his past ""offensive, hurtful and unacceptable"" remarks. Presidential candidate  Andrew Yang  had waded into the controversy, saying that it would be a mistake to dismiss Gillis for his 2018 podcast comments, which included anti-Asian slurs.  Dean Obeidallah  applauded Yang's suggestion of ""a more nuanced approach that offered the hope that people like Gillis can evolve."" Obeidallah, a former comedian and SNL staffer, wrote,  ""We should encourage and incentivize people to improve, instead of ensuring that they remain ignorant and hateful.""  Comedian  Judy Gold  thought SNL's call was sensible: ""Shane Gillis has every right to say whatever he wants -- that's what is so great about this country and the First Amendment. But let's get a few things straight. The clip wasn't exactly dug up; it's not old, it's from last year.  The clip is not funny, because it's not comedy.  It's a guy who happens to be a stand-up comic blathering with his friend, Matt McCusker, who also happens to be a stand-up comic, as they sit in front of microphones gratuitously spewing epithets and making lazy 'jokes' about other races, sexual orientations and gender without any real context or substance.""  An 'imposter'? In the midst of a challenging election campaign, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had to try to explain why he wore brownface or blackface at least three times. Amid his apologies, he admitted he didn't know how many times he had darkened his skin. ""Canada's elections take place on October 21, and it's looking like a tough race,"" wrote  Michael Bociurkiw . ""Any perception of being insensitive or hypocritical-- as an 'imposter,' in the words of one major Canadian newsmagazine earlier this year --  is certainly not the way Trudeau wants to be seen. Janaya Khan  suggested that, for Trudeau, ""blackface is a mere obstacle to overcome in his campaign run after receiving rebukes this week for darkening his face several times in the past. But for the millions of black, Indigenous and other people of color in Canada, this is far more than a simple scandal. Blackface is a reminder that people of color are  still considered to be 'characters' instead of equal and full human beings."" Be nice to the coral reefs The storms that have devastated the Bahamas are a reminder of the fragility of coastlines. Marine scientist  Michael Beck  wrote that endangered coral reefs are much more than a tourist attraction. They ""act as submerged breakwaters, they 'break' waves and protect communities and wetlands that further block waves and storm surge. ...coral reefs dampen more than 97% of waves before they reach coastlines. Losing just one meter from the top of a reef allows an exponential increase in the wave energy that passes through to the shore. This would lead to a doubling in the cost of flooding during storms for coral reef coastlines in more than 60 countries around the world."" Beck noted, ""Storms have shaped our shorelines for millennia, and for most of that time our reefs and wetlands  stood as guardians against those storms. Without them, we have only ourselves .""

"KEENE, N.H. —  Beto O’Rourke  began his rally with a non sequitur. He told a story of how he was killing time at a park a few hours earlier when he happened upon a woman pounding on a set of drums, with her car parked next to her, and the radio blasting “Any Way You Want It” by Journey. “And I thought, that is so punk rock!” Mr. O’Rourke effused. Mr. O’Rourke, the pin-balling presidential candidate from Texas, told the audience that he felt fortunate to have witnessed such “a beautiful, powerful, transcendent moment.” He then got to the point of his story. Or not: “I don’t even know why I’m telling you this,” he acknowledged. “Except that I had to share this with somebody.” Mr. O’Rourke’s entire campaign sometimes feels like one giant non sequitur. Where was this story going? Was there a point to it? And did he even care if anyone was taken aback? The answer that last question would seem to be “no,” and has become especially resonant since Aug. 3, when 22 people were killed in a mass shooting in Mr. O’Rourke’s hometown, El Paso. In the heightened aftermath of the slaughter, the once-celebrated candidate has found himself  restored to, or at least closer to, the place of political prominence  he seemed to relinquish from the second he began running for president early this year. “I think I feel differently personally and that can’t help but come through,” Mr. O’Rourke said in an interview, discussing how the shooting had changed the character, if not necessarily the trajectory, of his campaign. “I think El Paso reminded me or brought home for me how urgent this situation is out there in the country right now.” Mr. O’Rourke has become the most vocal candidate in pushing for tougher gun laws, including bans on the assault weapons used in numerous mass shootings. The issue has provided a kind of emotional centerpiece to a campaign that had seemed to lack one. It has also, in recent days, stirred the most emphatic crowd reactions at Mr. O’Rourke’s events to date, including a standing ovation Saturday at the  Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines , where 17 Democratic presidential candidates appeared. “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,”  Mr. O’Rourke said  at this month's Democratic debate in Houston. The refrain — one of the most potent of his campaign thus far — earned him both instant applause inside the hall and near-instant condemnation from gun-rights advocates, some in the form of the threats that he says have become an ominous background companion to his life. He was also admonished by many Democratic leaders who worried that his vow to take away guns would confirm every caricature of a radicalized left intent on punishing law-abiding gun-owners. “I don’t know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O’Rourke,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said in a conference call with reporters. Mr. O’Rourke said he took pride in getting attacked by Mr. Schumer and President Trump (who had tweeted at him) on the same day. “It shows me we’re doing something right,” Mr. O’Rourke said Thursday, following a visit to a marijuana dispensary in Oakland, Calif. He said that provoking Mr. Trump and particularly Mr. Schumer showed he was willing to speak plainly and directly and not as a normal politician would. Later that day, in a session with reporters, Mr. O’Rourke would taunt Mr. Schumer for doing “absolutely nothing” on guns. “Ask Chuck Schumer what he’s been able to get done,” he said. To observe Mr. O’Rourke in recent week s  is to witness one candidate’s unfiltered attempt at a midcourse transformation. It’s a shift that has taken him far beyond the norms of a typical presidential primary campaign itinerary, with stops in California to tour Skid Row in Los Angeles, San Quentin State Prison in Marin County and Blunts and Moore, the pot dispensary in Oakland, where he unveiled a plan to legalize marijuana. For his part, Mr. O’Rourke, says he could give a damn about adhering to the niceties of campaigns, and he has been proving as much with his frequent deployment of four-letter words more incendiary than “damn.” “Over the last five weeks, I’ve just been focused on saying what’s on my mind, being myself,” Mr. O’Rourke said. “And not really in the slightest being interested in polls, or how things poll, or what you’re supposed to say.” That’s fortunate, or at least handy spin, given that Mr. O’Rourke’s poll numbers have been stuck in the low-single digits for months, with negligible movement since El Paso. The blessing, say Mr. O’Rourke’s campaign advisers and supporters, is that he is once again the unvarnished candidate that captivated them during his near miss Senate campaign in Texas last year against the incumbent Republican Ted Cruz. He is still doing some campaigning as it used to exist: talking to people in early-voting states .   His audience sizes often number just in the double-digits, which could be viewed as a comedown  compared to the thousands that were thronging Mr. O’Rourke during his Senate race last year — including one September rally in Austin featuring Willie Nelson that drew upward of 50,000 people. Did he find this contrast deflating, a reporter asked Mr. O’Rourke after a low-key rally at Keene State College in New Hampshire? “Oh, I’m really grateful to anyone who would forgo a perfectly fine movie or dinner date to spend some time on a Friday night with a candidate for the presidency,” Mr. O’Rourke replied, offering perhaps the only possible answer a politician could give (what candidate would admit to being “deflated?”). Mr. O’Rourke still manages to project earnestness with his entire body.  He keeps casually dropping in his now-signature profanity  because, he explained, being polite and restrained “doesn’t always express the anger  o r the urgency that I feel.” His zigzagging trajectory over the last year can be ordered into pronounced phases. Last fall — the peak of his Beto-Mania Phase — ended in a narrow loss to Mr. Cruz. Nevertheless, the hype persisted. “We did not see that coming,” Mr. O’Rourke said of the continued attention, which ushered in a new phase. Late on election night, a couple of supporters wandered into Mr. O’Rourke’s El Paso home to commiserate. “They were just these drunk dudes in their teens who were bummed out and decided to come to Beto’s house,” Mr. O’Rourke recalled. “They just walked in and were like ‘Hey dude, we’re just so sorry you lost, can I get a selfie with you?’” “And I was like, ‘Sure, but you can’t just walk into someone’s house like this.’ And they were like ‘Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.’” Mr. O’Rourke nursed his defeat, set out on a road trip and went to the dentist, live-streaming as he went. He decided to run for president.  From the outset, the enterprise seemed to lack definition.  He was outshone and overtaken in a crowded field of movement progressives (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren), an established elder (Joe Biden) and new faces (Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris) who seemed brighter than last year’s meteor. He came off shaky and overwhelmed in the first two debates. Beto-mania 2018 seemed far away. After the Democratic debate in Houston this month, Mr. O’Rourke said he had struggled in the earlier debates because “I suck at acting.” He felt that he had been too scripted and rehearsed before, so he tried to be less so this time. “The first 30 or 40 minutes is like” — he growled out the sound of an explosion, pantomiming a hand-motion over his head that seemed to signify his brain blowing up. (Debates can be disorienting, is what appeared to be his point.) At one point, Cory Booker was asked whether Americans should abide by vegan diets, as he does. The New Jersey senator replied: “No,” and added, “actually, I want to translate that into Spanish — ‘No.” “I wanted to kind of like, high-five him across the stage,” Mr. O’Rourke said, and he later commended Mr. Booker for the line backstage.  “And then Joe Biden said something really nice,” Mr. O’Rourke said. “And then he and I talked a little bit and had one of those little moments.” Mr. O’Rourke can sometimes come off like an excited adolescent talking about a campaign-themed teen tour. He is collecting experiences, searching for something authentic. Here is something authentic: fear, of which there is no shortage in the country, especially around guns. The morning after the debate, Mr. O’Rourke pulled out his cellphone and called up a text message he had just received. It was from an unidentified party inviting him — and not in a nice way — to “come take my AK-47.” “I have been getting these messages from different numbers, emails, you know,” he said, explaining that people have been arrested after making threats on his life. Mr. O’Rourke has three young children and is fully aware of what’s possible. No security detail is evident around him. People show up with guns at his rallies and many know where he lives. He has become one of the biggest lightning rods in this hottest of national debates. Does he himself get scared? “For me, this is a great question,” Mr. O’Rourke said. “I think it goes to the heart of why we haven’t made progress.” He was referring to “progress” in stopping gun violence, not progress as a campaign. Yes, people are scared, he said, intimidated by the threats and perceived political risks and frightened into silence. “People keep begging us to do something,” he said. “It’s really powerful. And that’s the judgment I fear, more than people threatening us with guns.” Is this a higher purpose or another phase? At the very least, Mr. O’Rourke has burrowed a place for himself in the 2020 free-for-all, wherever he is headed. He has gotten people’s attention again, including from the president, who tweeted that Mr. O’Rourke’s vow to confiscate some assault weapons had “made it much harder to make a deal” on guns. “Dummy Beto,” is how the president addressed him. Asked about this in San Quentin, Mr. O’Rourke said he “could care less.”"
"Pelosi announces plans to go forward; Mike Emanuel has the details.

"Forty-two percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers said they want to continue the state's caucus system, which has traditionally made the Hawkeye State the center of the early months of presidential campaigns, even if it means not everyone who wants to can participate. Iowa's status as the first state where voters weigh in on who the parties will nominate to run for the White House has given it special importance in the campaign as many candidates choose to spend much of their time meeting voters in diners and house parties across a state that demands face-to-face interactions with the candidates. However, that tradition has been questioned in recent years and now 44% of likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa say they're in favor of switching to a primary, even if it risks Iowa's status as the first contest of the nominating season. Advocates for a primary argue it would increase access to the voting process because it wouldn't require hours of participation in the same way that a caucus does. Voters in Iowa who spoke to CNN after taking the poll saw pros and cons to both sides of the argument, but many mentioned how much they enjoy the ability to meet candidates and the unique opportunity that is provided to them.  ""I've had the chance to meet just about every presidential candidate throughout my life, since I was 11. That's awesome,"" likely Iowa caucusgoer Allie Paarsmith told CNN. ""I know how lucky I am. We just wouldn't get that sort of attention otherwise, it brings people to the Midwest. It would be sad to see a Midwestern state lose that first in the nation status.""  RELATED: Full poll results Voters who tend to be more liberal or younger are more likely to prefer a primary system where voting is more accessible -- those who say they're very liberal would rather hold a primary (64%) over a caucus (30%) by a wide margin, and a majority of those under the age of 35 prefer a primary (53% primary, 36% caucus). Moderate likely Democratic caucusgoers preferred holding a caucus (52%) so that Iowa would remain as the first test for the Democratic Party rather than hold a primary (38%), as did those age 55 and older (47% caucus, 37% primary). Those who have attended a caucus before were more apt to favor a caucus (46%) than those who would be attending for the first time in 2020 (28%), and men were more likely to favor caucuses (50%) than women (37%). Paarsmith, a librarian in the greater Iowa City area, said that while she loves being able to meet candidates, she understands how hard it is for some people to have a caucus.  ""People work! Especially Democrats work all hours of the day. It really is eliminating a poorer population, typically of color, that can't attend the caucus because they're at work or recovering from a 12 hour shift,"" she said. Multiple Iowans expressed their sympathies towards those who can't take time off, and wanted to make it easier for those people, but weren't always sure if a primary system would be the solution. Kevin Cavallin, a moderate Democrat who still hasn't officially decided which candidate to support in February, is an adamant supporter of the caucus system.  ""The problem with that notion is the fact that New Hampshire is the first primary. If Iowa switches to a primary system, that violates New Hampshire and Iowa's agreement ... and to me that's unacceptable,"" he told CNN. ""I mean, it sounds selfish, but at the same time, I think the caucus system works. The advantage of Iowa is that it doesn't cost you a small fortune to campaign here.""  But almost half of those polled disagree. They don't see the caucus as that important for the state's sense of identity.  Kelli Sharpe, a 39-year-old liberal Democrat, would prefer a primary.  ""I'm actually one of the few Iowans who doesn't think we should be first in the country. I don't think that makes sense,"" she told CNN. ""We're not very many people, and we're making decisions for everybody. The primary is much more easy to pull off, it's simpler, I think that would be a better system."" Likely caucusgoers who said they turned out in 2016 for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are divided on the caucus question, with 49% in favor of a primary and 44% preferring a caucus, while those who backed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016 are more firmly in the caucus camp (53% caucus to 39% primary). Sanders' backers were part of a movement in the Democratic Party to reform the presidential primary process, which included increasing access to caucuses in states that continue to hold them. That movement led Iowa's Democratic Party to propose a new system of ""virtual caucuses,"" designed to maintain the state's long-standing caucus system while expanding participation in the process. The proposal was ultimately rebuffed by the DNC because of concerns about security for those participating remotely, and instead Iowa will add in-person satellite caucuses for those who are unable to caucus in their home precinct. Cavallin, who strongly prefers a caucus, said he still wants it to be better -- having a surrogate go in a voter's place if that person couldn't caucus or a letter of intent have been mentioned as possible reforms -- but what's most important to him is that people's voices are heard and the election is conducted fairly.  ""It's important to have the caucus, but it's also important to get it right,"" he said. ""I'm not selfish enough to say that 'I want Iowa to be first no matter what.' It's nice that we're first, but we need to do it right and we need to take it seriously.""  The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll was conducted by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, September 14 through 18 among a random sample of 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample of likely caucusgoers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points."
"As with so much in the Trump presidency, it all starts with Hillary Clinton. Here's what we know: Giuliani's accusation Rudy Giuliani, the President's attorney and political attack dog, said on CNN Thursday night that his ongoing efforts to  pursue Clinton took him to Ukraine . First he alleged, without evidence, that she and Democrats were behind the effort to discredit Paul Manafort, who is currently in prison for, among other things, laundering money he was paid as a political consultant in Ukraine. Then things turned away from Clinton. ""In the course of investigating that, I found out this incredible story about Joe Biden, that he bribed the President of the Ukraine in order to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,"" said Giuliani, alleging a media coverup. ""That is an astounding scandal of major proportions, which all of you have covered up for five or six months."" From there the interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo went completely off the rails and Giuliani eventually admitted he had asked the current Ukrainian government to look into Biden. ""Of course I did!"" he said. But the President's attorney trying to get action from Ukraine is one thing. It would be something different entirely if the administration used official leverage to get a foreign country to investigate a US political rival, especially just months after special counsel Robert Mueller detailed multiple interactions between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia but found nothing rising to the level of coordination between campaign associates and officials and Russian governmental officials. Trump spoke with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 and that phone call may be part of what led to the complaint against Trump. Asked Friday about that July 25 call and whether he mentioned Biden to the Ukrainian President,  Trump tried to deflect back to Biden . ""It doesn't matter what I discuss,"" he said. ""But I will say this: Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case."" On Friday afternoon, the Wall Street Journal reported that on that phone call Trump pressured the new president ""about eight times"" to work with Giuliani on Biden, citing people familiar with the matter. Vice President Mike Pence recently met with Zelensky and was asked about Giuliani's efforts and whether the administration has held up aid to Ukraine as a result. REPORTER: Specifically, number one, did you discuss Joe Biden at all during that meeting yesterday with the Ukrainian President?  And number two, can you assure Ukraine that the hold-up of that money has absolutely nothing to do with efforts, including by Rudy Giuliani, to try to dig up dirt on the Biden family? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE:  Well, on the first question, the answer is no.  But we — with President Zelensky yesterday, we discussed — we discussed America's support for Ukraine and the upcoming decision the President will make on the latest tranche of financial support in great detail. Ukraine uses the aid in its efforts against Russian separatists, part of a long-term conflict with Russia. Biden's efforts in Ukraine Despite Giuliani's allegation, there has been no media coverup of the allegations against Biden.  The New York Times wrote about Biden's son  and his activities back in May and made clear that Trump's allies were pushing it. The President tweeted about it at the time. Since then, Trump, Giuliani and others have come back to the story repeatedly. Asked about Trump's statement Friday, Biden said ""Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion."" ""Not one single one, and so I have no comment except the President should start to be (the) President,"" Biden said. The crux of Giuliani's allegation is that Joe Biden tried to have Ukraine's top prosecutor ousted in 2016 because of an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. At the time, Hunter Biden was serving on Burisma's board. But the reality is much more nuanced. It is absolutely true that at the same time Burisma was being investigated, western governments, including the Obama administration wanted the prosecutor removed due to concerns about corruption in his own office. Biden too opposed  the prosecutor in Ukraine, Viktor Shokin, and threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine. He's actually bragged about it. Recounting a trip he made to Kiev in 2016, he said it showed the US was able to get Ukraine to take corruption more seriously. ""I looked at them and said: I'm leaving in six hours,"" Biden  said during an event at the Council of Foreign Relations in 2018 . ""If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" None of this is a particularly good look for the Bidens, but there's no proof or suggestion of any actual wrongdoing. At least one former official in the prosecutor's office said the investigation into Burisma had already been shelved by the time Joe Biden was threatening to withhold financial aid unless Ukraine replaced its top prosecutor. It's also not clear if Hunter Biden was a focus of that investigation when it was occurring. In an interview on May 14 posted on Facebook by his assistant, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yury Lutsenko said Burisma paid an entity connected to Hunter Biden ""millions,"" but added, ""from my point of view, a board member can be paid whatever a company decides ... they didn't violate any Ukrainian laws.""  He said that he said it was a matter for US law to consider, not Ukrainian investigators. Lutsenko in May said he was looking to ""reanimate"" an investigation of Burisma, Hunter Biden's former employer -- but that apparently never happened. Lutsenko left office in August after the new administration of Zelensky took office. Giuliani himself went to meet with a representative of Zelensky after the President's call with Trump in July. According to Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Ukrainian officials understand there is a link between what Giuliani was asking of the Ukrainians to do and getting US military aid. Murphy met with the Ukrainian President a few weeks ago and described the scene on Twitter. ""Zelensky did not explicitly connect the two in our meeting, but he was VERY concerned about the cut off of aid, and VERY aware of the conversations that Rudy Giuliani was having with his team. I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump's campaign operatives. He agreed,"" Murphy explained in a series of tweets.   Trump's playbook Fostering conspiracy theories about his rival was a strategy that worked for Trump in 2016 as he used decades of conservative conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton to label her ""crooked"" and suggest she should be in jail rather than the White House. Biden, however, is not followed by the same political taint as the Clintons and the effort by Trump and his allies may now have led to a whistleblower sounding the alarm under a law meant to protect intelligence officials for uncovering improper activity. The specifics of the whistleblower complaint remain a mystery and could remain that way as Trump's new acting Director of National Intelligence refuses to share information about the complaint with Congress. The Intelligence Community Inspector General has caused alarm by publicly saying he is being kept from doing his job. Father and son Hunter Biden's personal life and substance abuse issues have already caused angst for the former vice president. The overlap between the father and son's political and business interests have fueled GOP attacks that Biden is little more than a self-interested politician. Whether the facts fully support that case appears to be an afterthought for his critics. GOP researchers have been digging through Hunter Biden's career history as well as the points where it appears to intersect with his father's, particularly where it pertains to Ukraine and China, another topic Giuliani brought up during his interview with Cuomo."
"The affair, centering on Trump's contacts with a leader of a mystery foreign nation -- identified in two reports as Ukraine -- has also injected a toxic element into relations among the President, the intelligence community and Congress. It is hard to see how any of this ends well. Six months after special counsel Robert Mueller shut up shop, the White House again faces suspicion over Trump's dealings with a foreign power and seems to be taking steps to stop the full story from coming out. Democrats are rummaging for new skeletons in Trump's closet and yet another showdown is developing between the executive and Congress that appears almost certain to play out in the courts. The details of the controversy unleashed  when a whistleblower sounded the alarm  about the President are complex, disputed according to political allegiance and largely not public. The Washington Post  and  The New York Times  reported Thursday that the contacts at issue between Trump and the foreign leader involve Ukraine. In the past, some of Trump's supporters, including his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, have urged the Kiev government to open investigations that the President could use to raise suspicions about his political rivals, including Joe Biden. In a  heated exchange with CNN's Chris Cuomo  on Thursday night, Giuliani denied asking Ukraine to investigate the former vice president, before admitting he had done just that. The US and Ukraine were in discussions about $250 million in military aid to Kiev this summer that had been delayed by the White House. Giuliani said he didn't know anything about the package, but that if Trump had used it as leverage to benefit himself politically in any way he would not have done anything wrong.  ""The reality is that the President of the United States, whoever he is, has every right to tell the president of another country you better straighten out the corruption in your country if you want me to give you a lot of money. If you're so damn corrupt that you can't investigate allegations -- our money is going to get squandered,"" Giuliani said.  T rump attempted to discredit the whistleblower as ""highly partisan"" in a series of tweets Friday morning, echoing remarks made by Giuliani on Thursday night. The President said his comments to ""a certain foreign leader"" were ""pitch perfect."" Trump tweeted: ""Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!"" Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. There is so far no public evidence that the whistleblower's complaint pertains to this conversation or that there was any abuse of power by Trump. The White House later lifted the hold on aid.  But the potential ramifications of this new storm are already becoming clear and the risks facing the President, the intelligence community and Democrats in Congress are climbing by the day. Disturbing possibilities There must at least be a possibility that Trump abused his power or committed a grievous ethical lapse in dealing with the foreign leader. His defense was not exactly reassuring, considering some of the wild comments the President has made in the company of rogue counterparts such as Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un. ""Is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call?"" Trump tweeted on Thursday. CNN reported Thursday  that the intelligence community inspector general suggested to the House Intelligence Committee that the complaint raised concerns about multiple actions. He would not say whether those instances involved   Trump, sources familiar with the closed-door briefing told CNN. The inspector general, Michael Atkinson, was legally unable to discuss the complaint itself, since Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has declined to hand it over. Democrats say he is compelled to provide the complaint under whistleblower legislation, and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said his committee may take legal action if it isn't turned over. The Washington Post on Wednesday  said the complaint referenced a ""promise"" Trump allegedly made to the unidentified leader. CNN has not confirmed that aspect of the controversy. The whistleblower didn't have direct knowledge of the communications, an official briefed on the matter told CNN. Instead, the whistleblower's concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration's determination that the complaint didn't fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said. It is hard to know the potential exposure faced by the President. But given the sensitivity of the issue, the complaint is likely to have come from an official familiar with the scope of presidential power. And it was signed off as ""urgent and credible"" by the inspector general -- a Trump appointee -- who thought Congress should know in line with whistleblowing laws. The implication of such a fact pattern is staggering and opens up the potential of serious misconduct inside the White House -- despite Trump's denials of any wrongdoing. A President maligned?  If, on the other hand, the alleged behavior by the President does not reach such a bar, the political fallout will be considerable. Trump, acting within his wide Article Two constitutional powers, may have been maligned and there will be accusations that the whistleblower -- though moving within the scope of the law -- will have overreached. The President's suspicion of the intelligence community, which he sees as a ""Deep State"" bent on overthrowing him, will grow. If a president cannot trust his own spies, and thinks they are working against him and not the country's enemies, then America's national security will be harmed. The President's allies are already arguing that the controversy is simply another ruse by House Democrats to damage Trump. ""He has very wide authority, really unchecked authority, to talk to world leaders about anything he deems appropriate as he is representing the United States of America,"" said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union.""If this were able to go forward, any staffer in an agency could constantly hobble a Democratic President, duly elected."" ""This is an unconstitutional argument,"" Schlapp said on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Of course, the White House could clear all this up by explaining the contents of the alleged contacts between the President and the foreign leader. But it is taking the opposite tack. According to three CNN sources , the White House and the Justice Department advised the director of national intelligence that the complaint isn't governed by laws covering intelligence whistleblowers. The revelation is the first known evidence of the White House's involvement in the standoff. There may be an argument that the content of the President's communications or an official's impressions of them sent to Congress are subject to executive privilege. But the administration's resistance to scrutiny is already fueling suspicions of a cover-up. And it throws new light on the role of Attorney General William Barr -- who has been accused by critics of shaping special counsel Robert Mueller's damning revelations to the President's advantage. Barr, who served in the same role for President George H.W. Bush, advocates a theory of expansive presidential power, one reason why he has become perhaps Trump's favorite Cabinet member. Whistleblowers exposed House Democrats argue that the White House is yet again adopting a model of presidential power that threatens to tear the checks and balances of the US system to shreds. Schiff effectively argued that the approach taken by the administration could lead to the quashing of whistleblower claims in the government. That could lead down a road of power without accountability and in theory impunity for any presidential wrongdoing. ""The impact of this opinion is that if the Department of Justice decides that any employee of the intelligence committee comes forward, follows the law, follows the process, is nonetheless outside the process, they're not protected,"" the California Democrat said. ""Which not only means this whistleblower is not protected, it means no whistleblower is protected. That is the danger of the DOJ's misinterpretation of the law."" The fresh confrontation between the White House and the Congress is certain to fuel the frustration of Democrats at the White House's efforts to evade scrutiny. And it will add momentum to claims of many grass roots liberals and a growing corps of House Democrats who do not share House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reluctance to proceed with impeachment."

This threatens the well-being of millions of Americans. Efforts to discredit and undermine the program, whether through benefit cuts or privatization, will ultimately erode the nation’s entire social welfare system. Individuals earning under $50,000 a year receive 90 percent of Social Security benefits. Nearly half of all racial minority retirees rely on them for all or nearly all of their  income .  It’s time Democrats debated this vital issue. Michael Reisch Baltimore The writer is a professor of social justice at the University of Maryland School of Social Work. To the Editor: No  one is talking about or seems to care about the  deficit and national debt . We are running a  $1 trillion deficit  during good times, so what happens when things go south, which they inevitably will? I don’t want to saddle my children with a huge national debt. Matt Carbone Valhalla, N.Y. The writer is an accountant.  To the Editor: There has yet to be any meaningful debate discussion of  the judiciary . The president has appointed over  150 judges  (and counting), including two Supreme Court justices, one of whom remains controversial a year after his appointment. I would like to hear questions about what the candidates would be looking for in their judicial appointments and also what they plan to do when their plans are inevitably derailed by judges appointed by this president. It may also be time to open a discussion of changes to the judiciary, such as term limits for judges. Should someone who is president for only four (or even eight) years really be able to reshape the judiciary for 40 years?  The Republicans are highly successful at getting their voters to the polls with promises of judicial appointments. It is beyond time for the Democrats to stress the importance of judicial appointments to their voters. If the president is re-elected, he will undoubtedly get at least one more Supreme Court appointment, and the consequences for the country would be dire. Judy Gitlin Valley Cottage, N.Y. To the Editor: I  offer the candidates not an issue to discuss but a plea to include in their discussion what has been absent:  the hope and promise of America . The candidates, rightly enough but relentlessly and angrily, point to what we do wrong, to our endless faults, our systemic racism, sexual harassment, cruel capitalism, economic injustices and widespread discrimination. Recall Ronald Reagan’s  “Morning in America”  ad. However shallow it may have sounded, and however much mocked, it resonated deeply, and we recall it even today.  Perhaps candidates should take a hint. Perhaps point to a vision, however imperfectly realized so far, of a country where liberty and justice are part of its promise and its future, a country for which so many sacrificed. Perhaps draw inspiration if not from Reagan then from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose message always remained one of hope, of a dream.  Mel A. Topf Providence, R.I.  To the Editor: The  issue of  affordable housing  for low- and moderate-income persons has not been adequately addressed. Although Senator Bernie Sanders and Julián Castro, former Housing and Urban Development secretary, have made fleeting references, I have not heard a thorough discussion of this problem, including homelessness. I believe that decisive federal action is necessary because local and state government simply lack the resources to solve this nationwide problem. Bob Ryan San Francisco To the Editor: It  is becoming increasingly apparent that Congress has ceded too much power to the unrestrained discretion of the president on matters such as tariffs, spending (on, for example, the wall) and war by invoking an “emergency.” There must be discussion about what the candidates would support to properly  rebalance power  between the executive and legislative branches. Joel Lutzker Greenwich, Conn. To the Editor: I  have an opposite suggestion: Ban all questions about health care. We need to hear about other pressing issues. David Martocci Interlaken, N.J. To the Editor: The  Democratic debates have virtually ignored numerous  national security  issues, particularly the bloated defense budget; the overzealous tempo of military deployments; the overabundant overseas bases; the unnecessary modernization of our nuclear weapons; and the troublesome decline of arms control and disarmament. The United States has become the dominant arms merchant in the international arena and has downplayed the important instrument of diplomacy. A manifesto signed by  Bertrand Russell, Albert Einstein and others  warned years ago: “ We have to learn  to ask ourselves, not what steps can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a military contest that will be disastrous to all parties?”  The Democratic debates would be a good place to start this conversation.  Melvin A. Goodman Bethesda, Md. The writer is a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy and former C.I.A. intelligence analyst. To the Editor: Millions  of workers are earning less than their parents did. This is true of those affected by automation and international trade and those with less than a high school education. They have not only lost income but also feel left out. What will the candidates do to increase the supply of well-paying, respected  jobs ? Peter Dawson Boulder, Colo. To the Editor: Debate  topics? How perfect that the mandate is “ no more than 200 words .” I’d like to see a discussion of the very  travesty of “debates” : prime-time manufactured, largely substanceless verbal contests with strict time limits. No nuance, no depth, no real follow-up.  It’s all sportscasting, replete with countdown clocks and sleazy previews and promotions, offering the promise of zingers, punches landed, gaffes, put-downs, rehearsed scripts, weaponized sound bites. Afterward are headlines about who won, who lost, who’s out, who came back.  How much better would be in-depth, challenging interviews, with follow-ups, rather than this sorry, unbearable sideshow.  Susan Wolfson Princeton, N.J. To the Editor: Agriculture  is being recognized as both the culprit and the savior in our race to combat climate change. I’d like to know what the candidates plan to do about the crisis affecting land stewardship and food production. In the Midwest, where I live, small farmers struggle to make a living, are ignored by federal and state governments, and often end up abandoning their important profession. It’s time to recognize that the fate of these farms is the canary in the coal mine. Vikki Proctor Evanston, Ill. To the Editor: One  glaring omission is  reproductive rights . While most candidates have at least alluded to protecting those rights, there has been no specific question about what each would do to keep the Supreme Court from reversing Roe v. Wade, even though a case challenging it is likely to come before the court in the next few years. Even more important, what would the candidates do to protect access to contraception, now covered in the Affordable Care Act? As The Times  just reported , the abortion rate is at its lowest since 1973, when it became legal, partly because of coverage of long-term contraception methods by Obamacare. Now the Trump administration is trying to roll back contraceptive coverage. How will the next Democratic president ensure that women have control over their reproductive lives? Ellen Sweet New York The writer is former vice president of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health. To the Editor: I  wish the candidates would address the  dysfunction in the Senate . Particularly, why does the Senate majority leader have such outsized power to shape national policy by controlling what the Senate will even consider? It is not a matter of constitutional law. It is just Senate rules — essentially a tradition, tacitly agreed upon among senators. The Senate does not reflect principles of democracy, and it needs reform. I would like to hear the leading candidates, several of whom are senators, discuss ways to reform the Senate and place some limits on the power of the majority leader.  Michael T. Ferro Endwell, N.Y. To the Editor: I  would ask: What rules or restraints would you impose upon yourself and others in your administration on  tweeting ?  Dick Stoll Milwaukee"
"White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham says Turmp is weighing the release of Ukraine phone call transcript. Following  President Trump 's claim that he did nothing wrong during his phone call with  Ukranian  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy,  White House  press secretary  Stephanie Grisham  said he's ""willing"" to release the transcript. ""When foreign leaders come together to speak, they need to be able to speak candidly,"" Grisham said during an interview on "" Fox & Friends "" Monday. ""I do think that perhaps releasing this kind of a transcript could set a bad precedent,"" she noted. Trump has been accused of pressuring Zelenskly to investigate  2020 presidential  hopeful  Joe Biden  and his son Hunter for their connection to a natural gas firm that is linked to a corruption investigation.  Democratic  lawmakers and some in the media have since called on Trump to release the full transcript of the conversation. ""[President Trump] is willing to do it, I think. But there's a lot of other people, lawyers and ... such that may have a problem with it. So we'll see what happens."" POMPEO HOPES GOVERNMENT CAN 'GET TO THE BOTTOM' OF ANY POSSIBLE BIDEN WRONGDOING Grisham said Democrats are choosing to attack Trump out of desperation and are grasping at straws to distract from their failure to resonate with voters. ""This is just another reason for Democrats and for the media to attack and look for things that just aren't there,"" she said earlier in the interview. ""The fact of the matter is, the president has calls with foreign leaders all the time. People are listening [in] on those calls generally. There's some kind of a transcription made generally. And the president knows that. And he's above board."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She also said Democrats' calls for  impeachment  will continue to fall on deaf ears, as the party's legislative agenda continues to stall in Congress. ""They can keep yelling [impeachment]. This just shows they don't have anything to run on themselves,"" Grisham added. ""They've no issues. They can't get anything done. So they're going to attack this president. It's fine."""
"The letters from Sen. Bob Menendez -- sent to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Inspector General Steve Linick -- come after the New Jersey Democrat made clear on the House floor Monday that he would seek more information on the call as  House Democrats near a ""tipping point""  on impeachment in the wake of the Trump administration blocking a related whistleblower complaint's release to Congress.  On Friday,  CNN reported  Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was part o f the whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. Trump on Sunday acknowledged that he discussed Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. In his letter to Linick, Menendez requests that the Inspector General ""immediately open an investigation"" into the Trump administration's withholding of foreign military assistance to Ukraine and whether it was tied to the whistleblower complaint.  Menendez calls the withholding a ""highly unusual move and without any legitimate explanation.""  Menendez's letter to Pompeo seeks information surrounding the State Department regarding the agency's ""role in delaying assistance to the Ukraine and facilitating meetings between the President's personal attorney and Ukrainian officials to discuss a potential Ukrainian investigation intended to bolster The President's 2020 election prospects."" The letter requests a series of records surrounding the July call with a requested response by September 30. Menendez's letter to Mulvaney similarly requests details regarding the role ""the Office of Management and Budget, and you personally, played"" in blocking security assistance to the Ukraine.  Trump previously branded criticism of the call a ""Ukrainian Witch Hunt,"" while Biden accused the President of abusing his power to ""smear"" him. White House officials are considering releasing a transcript of Trump's call with the Ukrainian President,  multiple sources have told CNN , but some senior administration officials are balking at the idea and the precedent it could send. Trump on Monday remained unclear about the fate of the transcript. Earlier this month, the chairmen of the House committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight announced an investigation into allegations that Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani had pressured the Ukrainian government to back Trump's reelection campaign. And over the weekend, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  sharpened her rhetoric  on the White House's refusal to produce the whistleblower complaint."
"Days after dismissing and downplaying a whistleblower's complaint , Trump has now acknowledged he discussed Biden in a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and CNN has reported that the President pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. But Trump has since tried to obfuscate any wrongdoing on his part and instead try to train the spotlight on Biden. ""Joe Biden and his son are corrupt,"" Trump claimed without offering specifics on Monday, his first day at the United Nations General Assembly, an annual gathering of world leaders in New York. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump added: ""If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they'd be getting the electric chair right now."" He did not specify what Biden ""did."" The President also denied claims he put pressure on the Ukrainian leader by threatening to withhold US aid, saying: ""I did not make a statement that 'you have to do this or I'm not going to give you aid.' I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that."" ""There was no pressure put on them whatsoever. I put no pressure on them whatsoever. I could have. I think it probably, possibly would have been OK if I did,"" he said. The Ukrainian government said this of the July 25 call : ""Donald Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA."" Trump also sent mixed signals on whether he would release a transcript of the call. ""It was a very nice call. I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon,"" he said, but then added that he was hesitant as to whether the transcript would be released, saying it may set a bad precedent for future calls with world leaders."
"To the Editor: Re  “ Claim on Trump Is Said to Involve a Foreign Leader ” (front page, Sept. 20): Donald Trump has said, “ I have the right  to do whatever I want as president.” Indeed this is mostly true. The president not only has broad powers but he can even be spared legal consequences as long as he remains in office. This was made painfully clear in the Mueller investigation. There are, however, red lines. The founding fathers did allow for congressional oversight and action in the event of a bad actor who would use the office of the presidency in service of himself rather than in service of the country. Now there is a whistle-blower in the intelligence community who has urgent information about the president that he believes Congress needs to know. It is information that Mr. Trump and the Justice Department would rather see withheld from Congress. If speculations are true, and the president himself or through an emissary threatened to withhold vital military aid to Ukraine if it did not investigate business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden’s son or pursue a corruption investigation of Mr. Biden himself, that type of quid pro quo would be deeply troubling. It is the definition of politically self-serving. Lawlessness is rampant in the Trump administration. If we want to restore the rule of law to our republic and faith in our democracy, we must insist that the whistle-blower be permitted to speak, come what may.  Felicia Massarsky Atlantic City To the Editor: The  legacy of President Trump will be a field of horrors stretching to the horizon, but interrupted by a few bits of important insight into the flaws in our democracy. Who would have thought a president would refuse to disclose his potentially conflicting business interests, then use his powers to enhance those very interests? Who would have thought that the nation’s chief executive would dispatch a lackey to threaten his duly appointed attorney general with professional execution if he didn’t reverse a principled decision? Who would have thought that in service of his re-election, the leader of the nation might have tried to enlist a foreign power to conduct an investigation of his likely political opponent? Yes, one day we’ll look back on these times with disgust, but it will be seasoned with a pinch of sardonic gratitude to the man who showed us where we might find the cracks in what we thought was the seamless wall of our democracy.

"New questions surround Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son and his ties to the Ukraine; insight from investigative reporter Peter Schweizer, author of 'Secret Empires,' and Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, author of 'Witch Hunt: The Story of the Greatest Mass Delusion in American Political History.' Author  Peter Schweizer  on Friday night addressed the questions surrounding Hunter Biden’s involvement with a  Ukrainian natural gas company  while his father, former Vice President  Joe Biden , oversaw America’s Ukraine policy. ""The underlying story here involves Hunter Biden going around the world really collecting large payments from foreign governments and foreign oligarchs in the case of Ukraine,"" Schweizer, the author of ""Secret Empires,"" said on Fox News'  ""The Ingraham Angle."" CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT Joe Biden, now the Democratic presidential frontrunner for 2020, faced scrutiny for months over accusations that he pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who at that time was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Biden's son. Rudy Giuliani, a personal attorney for President Trump, has suggested that Biden worked to protect the company from investigation while in office. Biden said Friday that the claim has no credibility. The issue involving the Bidens resurfaced Friday after  The Wall Street Journal  reported that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine. Schweizer implied Hunter Biden's credentials didn't match with the position he held, and that the situation looked suspicious. ""He is supposed to be advising them on natural gas regulatory issues. He has no background in Ukraine. He has no background in energy or natural gas. So the question is, What is he being paid for? He's not being paid for his expertise, he has none,"" Schweizer said. ""His father at this time is the point person on U.S. policy to Ukraine."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The author said Trump was ""right"" to ask for an investigation and accused Hunter of lying. ""Donald Trump is right to ask the question and to ask that there be an investigation to see what Hunter Biden was being paid for. Joe Biden has offered no answers,"" Schweizer said.

"Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is surging and has a real ground game in Iowa, says Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier, anchor of 'Special Report.' MANCHESTER, NH –  A new poll in the state that holds the  first presidential primary  in the race for the White House indicates  Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  has surged and now enjoys a slight 2-point advantage over  former Vice President Joe Biden,  the longtime front-runner in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The Monmouth University survey,  released Tuesday, also shows  Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont  fading to a distant third.  WARREN EDGES OUT BIDEN IN NEW IOWA POLL, SANDERS DISTANT THIRD Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in the state ,  with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within the survey’s sampling error.  Warren’s support has soared by 19 points from the previous Monmouth poll in the Granite State, which was conducted in May. Biden’s dropped 11 points from that survey. Sanders, meanwhile, is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent, dropping 6 points from Monmouth’s May survey.  New Hampshire, which votes second in the presidential nominating calendar following the Iowa caucuses, is considered by many political analysts and pundits as a must-win for both Sanders and Warren. The independent senator from Vermont crushed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, launching the one-time longshot for the nomination into a marathon battle against the eventual nominee. He’s retained a strong organization and devoted supporters in the state as he bids a second time for the White House. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  But Warren, who like Sanders hails from a neighboring state to New Hampshire, has also built up a powerful campaign organization in the Granite State, and has made numerous visits. Warren will return to the state to hold town halls on Wednesday and Friday. “Warren continues to look stronger with every new poll. She seems to be picking up support across the spectrum with gains coming at the expense of both Biden and Sanders,” said Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray. The surge from Warren is coming from self-described liberals, among whom she’s up 28 points since the May poll to stand at 39 percent, with Sanders dropping 13 points down to 16 percent. Warren’s also risen 11 points among self-described moderate and conservative voters to stand at 18 percent, with Biden dropping 15 points to stand at 30 percent. According to the poll, the only other candidate to register in double digits is South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who’s at 10 percent, slightly behind Sanders. Sen. Kamala Harris of California stands at 3 percent in the survey, with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each at 2 percent. The remaining 10 candidates tested in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls earned 1 percent or less in the poll. The Monmouth poll in New Hampshire is one of the qualifying surveys the Democratic National Committee uses for their polling thresholds for candidates to make the cut for the primary debates. Gabbard’s 2 percent showing in the new poll means she’s reached 2 percent in four qualifying polls, allowing her to make the stage at next month’s fourth round of nomination debates. The poll’s findings are similar to those of the latest poll in Iowa this past weekend.  A Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom  survey indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling. A new poll released Tuesday in Nevada, which holds it's caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren. A USA Today/Suffolk University survey  puts Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent. The most recent polls in New Hampshire have been all over the board, with one suggesting Sanders holding a lead; another indicating a three-way tie among Biden, Warren and Sanders; and a third pointing to Sanders trailing Biden and Warren. The Monmouth University poll was conducted from Sept. 17-21, among 401 New Hampshire voters likely to vote in next February’s Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. The poll’s release comes with four-and-a-half months to go until the New Hampshire primary.  “It is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux,” Murray noted. "
"""We don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,"" Trump told reporters in describing the call. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.) And Monday, sources told CNN that White House officials are considering releasing a transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky.    Now  House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Adam Schiff , normally reticent about impeachment, says that if a whistleblower complaint that was revealed last week shows Trump tying military aid to Ukraine to Ukraine probing the Bidens, ""we may very well have crossed the Rubicon"" on impeachment. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi spoke of ""a grave new chapter in lawlessness."" Trump's administration has already intervened to keep secret the whistleblower complaint that appears to be related to Ukraine -- thereby blocking the normal process that would inform Congress of the controversy.  And in doing so, he has aligned himself more closely with the tragic example of Richard Nixon, who resigned as Congress accused him of high crimes and misdemeanors. Trump made his regard for Nixon plain to me when, during a 2014 stroll around his office, he paused to pick up a framed letter. The note, signed in blue by the disgraced former President, urged Trump to go into politics. Trump told me he admired Nixon because he was such a good judge of talent. In my time with Trump, as I gathered research for a biography of him, he criticized Obama, both Presidents Bush, as well as Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, but he never said a bad word about Tricky Dick who, it must be said, spent a troubling amount of time on the dark side of politics.  Nixon's ""dirty tricksters,"" among them longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone -- who faces trial in November on charges of lying to Congress and obstructing justice -- worked with a level of creative malevolence that a manipulator like Trump would surely admire. But it was Nixon's hubris, combined with his lies, that proved his undoing. In Trump we hear echoes. Our current President's lies and misstatements are legion. The  current Washington Post count exceeds 12,000 . His hubris was on display during the 2016 campaign when he said he could ""stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone"" and not lose any votes. In office Trump has lived by the same heedless attitude, axing aides -- often for insufficient loyalty -- at a furious rate and turning the federal government into a Trump Tower on the Potomac, where one man rules by his gut instinct. Of course, the chaos and subsequent ineptitude of the Trump regime separates him from Nixon, whose team was generally effective in administering the government. Nixon's creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and his opening of relations with China, for example, were accomplished because he had deep experience in government.  But one of the impeachment articles that brought down Richard Nixon -- perhaps the most important one -- cited his refusal to release tapes of conversations that he had secretly recorded in the Oval Office. First revealed by White House aide Alexander Butterfield, the tapes proved Nixon's involvement in the Watergate cover-up and made it impossible for him to deny the truth. Here the comparison with Trump becomes, for the moment, a question mark, since we don't know exactly how the discussion of the Bidens was framed in the phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  And now the President seems to be saying he wants to release a transcript of the call. At first glance this openness suggests a real break from the Nixon stonewalling model, but a glance through recent history suggests Trump may just be more adept than Nixon when it comes to doublespeak.  In his  comments Sunday  about the transcript, Trump said, ""We'll make a determination about how to release it, releasing it, saying what we said."" A casual listener would hear in Trump's words a desire to make the call transcript public. But that's not what he said.  In fact, he noted any release would be ""saying what we said,"" which leaves lots of room for editing. Trump also added that releasing the contents of the call would pose challenges to foreign leaders and that intelligence officials may block him from coming clean. Sunday, both his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and his Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, were dispatched to the morning talk shows to caution against the release: ""I think it would be highly inappropriate to release a transcript of a call between two world leaders,"" said Mnuchin. We have heard this sort of thing before. Trump said he wanted to release his tax returns, as every president has for decades, but that his  lawyers wouldn't let him . The same thing happened during the Mueller investigation, when Trump repeatedly said he wanted to sit for the special counsel's questions, but then he followed a strategy that prevented the meeting from ever happening. Take all the evidence into account and it's easy to see that, like Nixon, Trump's ignoble impulses -- his obfuscation, his self-dealing -- represent a threat to the country and to his own presidency. The difference is a matter of style. Trump is Nixon, but with far more chutzpah and far less respect for the nation's institutions. He represents a dangerous variation on a tragic type."
"True to form the President and his confederates are only adding to the chaos. In response to questioning from CNN's Chis Cuomo Thursday night, for example, Trump's personal lawyer and TV attack dog,  Rudolph Giuliani, both denied and confirmed  that the controversy may have to do with the fact that Giuliani has urged Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden is leading the pack of Democrats hoping to oppose Trump in 2020. Could it be that the President's lawyer is mixing politics and policy in an unsavory way?   As usual it's hard to follow the action, but what is known thus far should worry us all. According to various news outlets, the White House and Justice Department told the inspector general for intelligence matters there was nothing to the whistleblower's report that a high level official, most likely the President, communicated in some untoward way with a foreign leader. Under apparent pressure from the White House and Justice, the acting director of national intelligence blocked the intelligence IG from notifying Congress of the complaint, sidestepping a law requiring this. Now Capitol Hill leaders and the administration are battling over  just who has a right  to see the complaint. In a normal, pre-Trump Washington, the issue of such a complaint would have been handled in a routine, if not collegial, way. But in this era, when the White House stonewalls as a matter of course, such a conflict seems inevitable—and, too, that the President would act in a way so heedless that some intelligence professional would sound an alarm But this new crisis is completely in character for Trump, who has always operated as if personal relationships, and his self-interest, are all that really matter in every context. In every organization he has ever led, from his businesses in New York to the US government he has insisted on being the sole authority and expert, a man who ignored the rules as a matter of routine. During his decades as a real estate developer and entertainer,  Trump's style meant that he controlled  all of the many hundreds of entities under his organization's umbrella, and those who worked below him were charged with making sure his decisions -- whether good or bad -- turn out for the best, while he claimed credit for successes and dodged accountability for failures.  Then, and apparently now, Trump relied on his instinct, which often got him into big trouble. Multiple bankruptcies proved that Trump's decision-making gut is a less-than-perfect instrument. Upon examining his failures,  Susan Craig, of The New York Times, declared,  ""We found most of it was just bad business.""  As President, Trump has depended on unconventional operatives like Giuliani to help him in an unofficial capacity. For months Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, has been trying to stir up concerns about Biden and his son Hunter's involvement with a Ukrainian energy firm. An official in that country  told The Daily Beast  that Trump is seeking compromising information. Trump himself  has said ""it doesn't matter""  if the President of the United States is engaged in this slimy business. In comments to reporters Friday,  he added:  ""I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate.""    Hope for real clarity on the matter is dimmed by the fact that Trump enjoys rubber-stamp support from the Republican-controlled Senate, which has approved nearly all of his nominees for federal positions only to see  a record number leave their posts in short order.  Most recently Trump was forced to withdraw his nominee for the top job at the Federal Emergency Management Agency amid an FBI investigation. FEMA is part of the  Department of Homeland Security, where ""acting"" officials are found in striking numbers  at the top of the organizational chart.  ""Actings"" are running things across the administration. In fact, the director of national intelligence caught up in the latest mess, Joseph Maguire, is on temporary assignment and, therefore, lacking the gravitas of an appointee who really owns the job. Although officials who lack permanent status surely suffer for it, their insecurity seems to suit Trump's seat-of-the-pants style.  He has said he prefers provisional appointees  because they are more readily moved in and out of positions. They might also be assumed to be more vulnerable to whatever pressure the White House applied.  The downside, of course, is that ""acting"" leaders may struggle to get anything done or to win the respect of their troops. (Imagine, for example, an army going into battle under a general whose stars were applied with Velcro and whose orders are under constant presidential review.)      Indeed, Trump has spent his life making sure that those who serve him feel like they are never quite secure, while at the same time he has sought to make himself immune to examination. As President,  he has long banned note-takers  from some talks with foreign leaders and then limited White House reporting on his phone calls with them.  The current whistleblower controversy appears to be yet another case of Trump seeking ways to avoid accountability. The  Washington Post reported  that White House records indicate that that Trump had had ""conversations or interactions with at least five foreign leaders in the preceding five weeks"": Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani.  CNN reported Thursday that the White House and the Justice Department told the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that the nature of the whistleblower complaint isn't covered by laws governing intelligence whistleblowers.   According to CNN : ""Previously the White House has cited longstanding precedent in refusing congressional requests for documents related to Trump's meetings with his Russian counterpart. 'It is settled law that the Constitution entrusts the conduct of foreign relations exclusively to the Executive Branch, as it makes the President 'the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations,'  White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote in a letter to Democrats in May."" The President defends his secretive dealings with foreign leaders by insisting that America's international success depends on his personal rapport with them. He says he has great relationships with the likes of Putin, North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un, China' President Xi and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.   Russia, China, North Korea and Saudi Arabia have all caused trouble to America during the Trump era, and his brand of personal politics hasn't seemed to help any. Instead, it has reinforced the suspicions that many held toward Trump when he was just a self-promoting businessman. Back then, of course, his business was his business. Today, he acts on behalf of the American people. Earning their trust requires that he follow the rules.     "
"Asked by CNN at Saturday's Iowa Steak Fry as she was leaving the grill area what steps Congress needed to take, the Massachusetts senator said, ""Impeachment, we need to start impeachment proceedings."" Warren, who is running for President,  first called for impeachment proceedings in April  after she read  special counsel Robert Mueller's report  on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.  Since then, she has repeatedly called for the House to begin impeachment proceedings but took it a step further Friday by calling Congress ""complicit"" in ""failing to act.""  ""After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment,""  she wrote in a tweet Friday evening . ""By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump's latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president."" She also wrote in a thread  that the President ""continues to commit crimes"" because ""he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won't either.""  She told reporters after a climate change town hall Friday evening that Trump ""continues to show that he has no regard for the law."" She did not address Biden in her tweets or with reporters. ""The way to hold the President accountable is for Congress to begin an impeachment proceeding. Congress hasn't done that,"" she told reporters in Cedar Rapids. ""And what the President has now demonstrated is that he thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors. He can go back to the well on exactly what he did before. And that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election. It's time for Congress to step up and begin serious impeachment proceedings against this man."" Trump pressed Ukraine's President to investigate Biden's son  during a call earlier this summer, a person familiar with the situation told CNN on Friday.  That call, which took place on July 25, a day after Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the intelligence community inspector general, the source added. The Wall Street Journal was first to report that Trump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the July phone call to investigate Biden's son, citing multiple people familiar with the matter."

It was a big day for corporate synergy on  ABC News ’ “The View” Monday when the network’s chief White House correspondent, Jonathan Karl, joined the daytime gabfest to explain  the controversy over a phone call  between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. For days, Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate 2020 hopeful Joe Biden’s family dealings – using military aid as leverage – and cited the reports to revive calls for the president's impeachment. GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN “Thank goodness Jonathan Karl is here,” co-host Whoopi Goldberg said after airing video of Trump’s explanation of the call. “What just happened?” Karl then explained that Trump admitted he talked about Biden directly with the Ukrainian president in July during a time that the United States was withholding aid money that Congress had already approved. NEW YORK TIMES DELETES 9/11 TWEET AFTER BACKLASH: 'AIRPLANES TOOK AIM AND BROUGHT DOWN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER' “We don’t know, was he pressuring?… was he suggesting?, we don’t know any of that,” Karl said before citing a Wall Street Journal report that Trump urged Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son. Karl then said there are people on Trump’s team urging him to release the transcript of the now-infamous phone call. Karl also said that if Joe Biden's son, Hunter, weren’t politically connected then he probably wouldn’t have been in a position to profit from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Hunter Biden, as far as I know, doesn’t have a lot of experience with Ukraine, I think if his name were Hunter Smith he probably wouldn’t have been getting paid,” Karl said. Co-host Meghan McCain then pointed out that reporters act like “the end of the world is coming” on a regular basis and asked Karl why this latest story was any different. “I think that this is significant and this is a little bit different and very easy to understand. You have what the president himself has already acknowledged, which is even if there was no quid pro quo, even if he wasn’t holding that aid over the head of the president of Ukraine, merely bringing up your political opponent in a conversation with a newly elected president, any president of a foreign country, is going to be seen as problematic,” Karl said.

"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Former Vice President  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  found himself fending off new questions about his decades-long record on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, in a testy exchange with a moderator who described his treatment of her as “condescending.”  During a Friday night forum focused on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, Mr. Biden seemed to recoil from the direct questioning from Lyz Lenz, a Cedar Rapids Gazette columnist.  In a question-and-answer session, Ms. Lenz repeatedly pressed Mr. Biden about his past votes for the Defense of Marriage Act, the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy that forbade openly gay people from serving and his statement earlier this year that Vice President Mike Pence, known for his socially conservative positions, was “a decent guy.” Mr. Biden sought to defend himself, reminding the audience in a steamy auditorium that he supported same-sex marriage before President Obama. “I didn’t have to evolve,” he said.  Then, before an audience of 700 volunteers, activists and voters, he called Ms. Lenz “a lovely person,” prompting her to reply, “just asking the questions people want to know.  Offstage after their exchange, she wrote on Twitter that Mr. Biden called her “a real sweetheart.” “I interpreted it as a little condescending,” Ms. Lenz said in a backstage interview, echoing the immediate criticism of some prominent feminists on social media.  Supporters of Mr. Biden said Ms. Lenz’s questions included a series of inaccuracies. His supporters said he didn’t back “don’t ask, don’t tell” and voted for an amendment to remove the measure from a broader bill in 1993. They also argue that she misrepresented the impact of the 1994 crime bill that he championed.  Mr. Biden had already responded to criticism of his comments about Mr. Pence earlier this year,  writing on Twitter  shortly after his initial remark that “there is nothing decent about being anti-L.G.B.T.Q. rights, and that includes the vice president.”  The forum, hosted by advocacy group Glaad, marked the first extended public discussion of L.G.B.T.Q issues in the 2020 Democratic primary race, which went largely unmentioned in the Democratic debates so far despite the group representing a loyal bloc within the Democratic Party. The focus on candidates’ past departures from contemporary progressive politics stemmed in large part from the lack of daylight between most of the major candidates on issues of L.G.B.T.Q. equality: nearly all back banning  conversion therapy  for minors; rolling back the spread of rules that allow religious businesses to decline serving L.G.B.T.Q. customers; and ending the Trump administration transgender military ban. Most have promised to pass the Equality Act, legislation opposed by the White House that would bolster the list of protected classes under civil rights law to include discrimination based on “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” “It’s about time we had a woke president on these issues,” Senator Cory Booker said, “so we see everyone for the equal dignity and equal citizenship we all have.” The candidates boasted about their accomplishments — large and small — on behalf of L.G.B.T.Q Americans. Mr. Booker noted that as mayor of Newark, he had vowed not to officiate any weddings until everyone had the right to wed. Senator Elizabeth Warren opened her appearance by reading the names of 18 trans women of color who have been killed this year. Mr. Biden said he has been sympathetic to same-sex couples since he was a boy, when, he said, he and his father witnessed two men kissing while disembarking from the train station in Wilmington, Del.  “He said, ‘Joey, it’s simple,’” Mr. Biden said. “They love each other.” In a historically diverse field, the L.G.B.T.Q. community has celebrated their own record-breaking first: Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.,  the first openly gay man  to mount a major campaign for president. Though Mr. Buttigieg has collected significant financial support from leaders in the gay community, some have begun to question his commitment to their causes. While Mr. Buttigieg frequently references his husband, Chasten, at campaign events and  told his coming out story on the debate stage  last week as an example of resiliency, he hasn’t placed L.G.B.T.Q. equality at the center of his campaign. He faced questions about a ban on gay men donating blood, pointing out that as mayor he couldn’t participate in a blood drive sponsored by his office.  “It’s an example, one of many examples, of the exclusions in this country,” he said. “We are still living with the long tail of prejudices.”  Other candidates also came with long records to tout. Mr. Biden, a reliable L.G.B.T.Q. ally, frequently points to his early support of gay marriage, noting his decision to break with the Obama administration and publicly endorse the policy in 2012. Mr. Obama followed a few days later. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii faced questions about  her history of anti-gay stances , including decrying “homosexual extremists” when her home state debated whether to legalize civil unions more than a decade ago. Ms. Gabbard has apologized for her past statements and said she no longer holds those views. “My record speaks for itself,” she said, citing her history of serving with L.G.B.T.Q people in the military and congressional record of supporting equality measures.  About 5 percent of voters in the four early Democratic primary states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — identify as L.G.B.T.Q., according to data collected by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s  largest L.G.B.T.Q. rights organization . Another 23 percent prioritize L.G.B.T.Q.-inclusive policies when voting, according to the group. The event is the first of two forums hosted by L.G.B.T.Q. organizations to question the candidates on their views. A second event, hosted by Human Rights Campaign in Los Angeles, will be broadcast on CNN next month."
"A look at who can be impeached and how the proceedings move forward House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., on Tuesday announced the launch of an official impeachment inquiry into  President Trump . This, amid an increasing clamor over a whistleblower’s complaint that Trump may have sought the help of a foreign government in his bid for reelection. The  announcement of the inquiry  marked early concrete steps by Congress, as some Dems call for his removal from office. But the full impeachment process, by design, is a long and multifaceted affair, not undertaken lightly. It could require months – and a great deal of political capital and partisan infighting – to run its course.  PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP Here is how impeachment proceedings are launched and what it would take to actually remove a president from office. How it works: The framers of the Constitution established impeachment as a way to hold a president accountable for abuses of power. The Constitution lays out some specific actions – think treason, or bribery – that would lead to impeachment and removal from office, and affords the president a trial to determine whether or not he's guilty.  Along with treason and bribery, the president can be accused of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” That's a rather vague term borrowed, as is so much of the language on impeachment, from British common law dating back to the 14th century. The term “high crimes and misdemeanors” was controversial when George Mason inserted it as a provision in the Constitution in 1787 and the phrase has confounded lawmakers and constitutional scholars ever since. While what makes an offense impeachable is debatable, the process for impeaching a president and removing him from office is fairly straightforward, albeit lengthy. Pelosi’s announcement of an impeachment inquiry from the House committees does not mean that the lower chamber of Congress will actually take up a resolution to impeach Trump – just that there's a plan to probe the whistleblower’s complaint surrounding the president’s phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. If lawmakers in the Democratically controlled House decide, however, to move forward with impeachment proceedings, the first step would be for a member of the lower body to introduce a resolution to impeach Trump. During the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s, the House didn’t even get this far; President Richard Nixon, facing mounting pressure from lawmakers and extreme unpopularity among the American public, resigned. REP. AL GREEN WARNS DEMS: 'THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO TURN ON US' IF WE DON'T IMPEACH TRUMP After introduction, Pelosi would have to direct House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., to hold a hearing to decide if the resolution will be put to a vote by the full chamber. Nadler would need only a simple majority in the committee to send the resolution to the House floor for a full vote. Simple majorities On the floor, all that is needed to actually impeach the president is another simple majority vote by those lawmakers present and voting. This is what happened to President Bill Clinton in 1998, when he was impeached by the House on the charges of lying under oath and obstruction of justice.  Clinton and Andrew Johnson are the only two American presidents to be impeached in the House. Misconception Just because a president is impeached, however, removal from the Oval Office is hardly a certainty. That is a matter to be decided during the president’s “trial” in the Senate. The trial is meant to decide whether the president has committed a crime; the procedure for the trial is set by Senate leadership. GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN During the trial, House lawmakers serve as so-called “managers,” who basically fill the role that prosecutors would in a criminal trial and present evidence against the president. The president is represented by his own counsel.  The chief justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial and the Senate acts as the jury – listening to the arguments from both sides before deliberating and voting on whether to remove the president from office. It takes a two-thirds vote to convict a president; with a finding of guilt, the president is removed from office and the vice president is sworn in to replace him.  How we got here:  Trump’s controversial conversation with the Ukrainian president is not the first time that the idea of impeaching him has been mentioned. Indeed, the specter of impeachment has loomed over his presidency since before he ever took office. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and calls from Democrats that Trump obstructed justice. Multiple tries by Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, to bring forth articles of impeachment. Billionaire Tom Steyer’s Need to Impeach campaign. All that and more has clung to the Trump administration. But Pelosi’s announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry marks the first time the House speaker has yielded to the demands of fellow Democrats on the matter. Pelosi previously has been extremely reticent even to discuss impeachment – worried that it would hurt Democrats' chances of taking back the White House in 2020 – so her announcement on Tuesday marked a major shift. So, what led to the change? Despite the phone call with Ukraine’s Zelensky taking place this past July, the impetus for the current impeachment push actually goes back to June, when Trump said during an interview that he would consider accepting damaging information about a political opponent from a foreign government without first notifying the FBI.  ""I think you might want to listen, there isn't anything wrong with listening,"" Trump told ABC News. ""If somebody called from a country, Norway, [and said] 'we have information on your opponent' -- oh, I think I'd want to hear it."" FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED A few days later, the Defense Department announced $250 million in aid to Ukraine, but by mid-July Trump told acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on the disbursement, with administration officials declining to give lawmakers more information on the matter. A day after Mueller testified before Congress on his Russia probe, Trump conducted what he called a “routine” phone call with Zelensky, which prompted the whistleblower’s complaint that Trump pushed Ukraine's leader for help investigating former Vice President Joe Biden -- a Dem frontrunner in the 2020 election -- and Biden's son Hunter. Three days after the phone call, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats resigned and Trump named National Counterterrorism Center Director Joseph Maguire his acting DNI. On Aug. 12, the unnamed whistleblower filed a complaint to Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, who in turn passed it on to Maguire. The acting DNI, however, did not alert Congress within the one week allotted to report the complaint, which forced Atkinson to send a letter to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Ranking Member Devin Nunes. Schiff sent a formal letter on Sept. 10 asking for the complaint, but three days later, Maguire denied the request and Schiff issued a subpoena. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The news of the complaint emerged publicly last week, and while Trump originally tried to shift the focus toward his allegations against Biden, he ultimately acknowledged he discussed Biden during his call but deflected on whether he wanted any damaging information on the former vice president. ""The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump said.

"'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani hitting the weekend shows to continue pushing the Biden-Ukraine controversy. In Donald Trump’s view, the best way to neutralize a scandal is with a good counter-scandal. We saw this throughout the Russia investigation, when the president countered the allegations of obstruction with a crusade against a witch hunt, Deep State conspiracy and fake news. Trump is doing it again with the media and political furor over his phone call with Ukraine’s leader, trying to shift the spotlight to questionable conduct by Joe Biden and his son. And early indications are that it’s working. BOLTON, NEOCONS HIT TRUMP FOR NOT STRIKING IRAN Philippe Reines, the former State Department official and longtime Hillary Clinton confidant, said on “Media Buzz” that after the first round of political combat over Ukraine, Trump is the winner. Whether that’s true or not, calling out Biden is very much the focus of the president’s counterattack against allegations that have reignited Democratic talk of impeachment. Rudy Giuliani told me on Sunday that the political crisis is helping him accomplish what he’s been trying to do for five months, which is focus media scrutiny on the former vice president and Hunter Biden, who was paid big bucks by a Ukrainian gas giant that had come under investigation. Joe Biden has publicly bragged about pressuring Ukraine into firing its top prosecutor, who was overseeing the case—though it was not active at the time--by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees. Giuliani pushed the Biden story on my show last April, and many other programs as well. He has also met with Ukrainian officials in an attempt to revive the Biden probe there. (No investigation has found wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.) The president’s personal lawyer laid it out yesterday with Maria Bartiromo: “It’s the only way you can get this out. The only way they would cover this story is by punching the president in the face and then the president deflects the punch which he’s done, the story came down and then he hits with a right hand that’s more powerful.” SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES And that, in turn, is producing stories like this one the other day in the  Washington Post: “Suddenly, Biden faced two dueling realities: The president he is hoping to defeat next year — and who he describes as morally unfit for office — is under scrutiny for behavior some view as treasonous. But the story is inextricably linked to Biden’s son, pushing one of the topics that Biden is least comfortable discussing into the spotlight.” The fact is it’s impossible to cover the furor over the Trump call without delving into the details of what at the least is Biden’s son trading on his name (as political relatives have done in every administration). Trump bristled at Ukraine questions yesterday at the U.N., telling reporters they are ""a fake news group of people...If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they'd be getting the eletric chair right now."" At a time when longshot GOP rival Bill Weld is accusing him of treason, the president did not explain why Biden's actions would result in a death penalty case. Those comments followed Trump telling reporters on Sunday that what the Wall Street Journal and others had reported about the July call was essentially true, though he insists it was totally appropriate: “The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine. And Ukraine, Ukraine’s got a lot of problems.” So Trump is being accused of the same thing he’s saying Biden did in 2015, pressuring Ukraine for partisan reasons. The administration has been holding up $250 in military aid to help Ukraine fight Russian separatists. Trump says he never brought up the aid, but he didn’t have to—it’s hanging in the air. The president said he’d “love” to release a transcript of the call with Volodymyr Zelensky, but has to figure out how to do so. By the way, Trump was wrong when he recently tweeted that the media “want to stay as far away as possible” from the Biden allegations. A quick search found many major stories on the matter, including: New York Times, 2015: “Joe Biden, His Son and the Case Against a Ukrainian Oligarch” Washington Post, 2019: “As Vice President, Biden Said Ukraine Should Increase Gas Production. Then His Son Got a Job with a Ukrainian Gas Company.” New Yorker, 2019: “Will Hunter Biden Jeopardize His Father’s Campaign?” Joe Biden, for his part, angrily accused Trump over the weekend of abusing his power in an attempt to “smear” him because he knows “I’ll beat him like a drum.” Biden said he never discussed overseas business dealings with his son, which prompted Trump to call him a liar. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker they briefly discussed it once. The more the story devolves into a partisan back-and-forth, the more it neutralizes the political danger to the president. That was the playbook against Bob Mueller. Nancy Pelosi is under growing pressure from some previously impeachment-wary Democrats to drop her opposition in light of Ukraine. She is holding the line for now while warning the White House that failure to turn over key documents could prove the tipping point. But Trump can easily survive—again—if he turns this into another two-sided scandal, filled with interminable details and unpronounceable names, that most Americans can’t follow."

"""Nothing came to me,"" Coats said Tuesday during an appearance at the Economic Club of Indiana,  according to The Indianapolis Star.  ""I left on August 15. ... The very next day that was presented to Joe (Maguire). I feel so bad for Joe. He is caught in a squeeze here and the lawyers are divided. So they are trying to work all that out. That's about all I can say about that."" Maguire has faced immediate scrutiny in his role after the Office of the Director of National Intelligence refused to comply with a deadline to hand over the whistleblower complaint to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which had been deemed by the intelligence community inspector general to be ""credible and urgent."" The whistleblower complaint deals, at least in part, with a phone call Trump had in July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Friday, CNN reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation.  On the day of Trump's call with Zelensky, word began to spread that Trump was reviewing a plan to cut foreign assistance to Ukraine. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either  Joe or Hunter Biden. Coats said that ""there's much I can't say"" about the situation, adding, ""We're in the secrets business ... obviously there are a number of things going on relative to that and you've been reading about it in the paper and there's speculation."" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff announced Tuesday that the whistleblower who filed the complaint would like to speak to the committee. The whistleblower has requested guidance from Maguire on how to do so, Schiff said. ""We have been informed by the whistleblower's counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI as to how to do so,"" Schiff tweeted. ""We're in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower's testimony as soon as this week,"" he added."
"Whistleblower complaint sparks questions about Joe Biden's dealings with Ukraine; Peter Doocy reports from Des Moines, Iowa. President Trump ’s allies are leaning into the controversy over a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, gambling that the increased attention to the story could actually hurt the president’s potential 2020 rival  Joe Biden . For days, Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump in July pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden family dealings – using military aid as leverage – and cited the reports to revive calls for the president's impeachment. But the firestorm, apparently related to a still-secret whistleblower complaint, has, in turn, opened the door for Republicans to revisit the original controversy involving Joe Biden's son Hunter. Further, they allege, the details of that story suggest Biden did the same thing Trump is accused of doing -- leveraging military aid to pressure Ukraine. GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN “The more they want to talk about Ukraine, the better,” Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Monday morning on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria.” Giuliani has long been looking into the Bidens’ ties to Ukraine, claiming Hunter Biden improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioning whether his dad helped protect him. Hunter Biden was hired by Burisma in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted by protesters and as his father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration. Two years later, then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired. Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner. Trump has claimed Shokin ""was after"" Hunter Biden and the vice president was trying to protect his son. “The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” Monday. Fox News reported on the Biden  controversy in April . The  New York Times  published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But the controversy flew largely under the radar until now. While the heat is on Trump over whether or not he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context. Trump allies are hammering that as the real scandal, as video of Biden once bragging about his role in having Shokin fired has gone viral. BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN LIKELY COMING TO AN END, NUNES SAYS Biden has denied wrongdoing, with Shokin having already been suspected of corruption before his dismissal, and hammered Trump over the reports on his phone conversation with Kiev. For his part, Trump  addressed  his phone call with Zelensky by calling the conversation “perfect” and insisting “there was no quid pro quo” and that he “said absolutely nothing wrong.” Trump also insists that the idea of withholding military aid from Ukraine is bogus because he gave the aid. Trump also tweeted Sunday night, stating that the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin. Giuliani is also trying to circulate new Biden allegations. Giuliani accused Kiev  on Monday of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden and suggested the Obama administration turned a blind eye. ""If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,” he tweeted. ""Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?"" While the former vice president has claimed he and his son never discussed Hunter’s business, Hunter told  The New Yorker  that they did talk about it once, with Joe Biden telling his son, ""I hope you know what you are doing."" Democrats and Republicans are both pushing for investigations. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has shied away from calling for impeachment in the past, told CNN on Sunday that the latest allegations against Trump may warrant such a measure. “If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit … then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents,” Schiff said. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls for impeachment for other alleged Trump transgressions, said Sunday that unless acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire provides information about the whistleblower complaint involving Trump to Congress, administration officials ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation."" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., meanwhile, told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that he wants the Justice Department to look into the Bidens’ dealings with Ukraine. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Nobody’s looked at this, but somebody should, so I’m hoping the Department of Justice will look at the Biden-Ukraine connection like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection,” Graham said. “Was there a relationship between the vice president’s family and the Ukraine business world that was inappropriate? I don’t know. Somebody other than me needs to look at it, and I sure as hell don’t trust the media to get to the bottom of it.” All this comes as Democrats continue to battle for the 2020 presidential nomination. After three debates, Biden remains the front-runner, but he has lost ground to rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with Warren surpassing Biden in a new Iowa  poll .

"""He's just flat out too old,"" said conservative columnist and Fox News contributor  Byron York  highlighting a persistent criticism of former Vice President Joe Biden's candidacy. ""You have a candidate in Biden who is asking the American public that if re-elected he can serve in the White House until age 86...that is total unchartered territory in American history and I don't think it's going to happen,"" he argued on  Fox Nation 's latest episode of ""Wise Guys."" Biden, 76 joins President Donald Trump at 73 years old and Democratic  candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders I-Vt., at 78 as the oldest candidates in the 2020 presidential race. BIDEN'S AGE, MEMORY COME UNDER ATTACK AT DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ""I think we're going to see a gradual dissipation in energy by the Biden campaign until he is finally overtaken,"" York continued, saying ""the bigger issue is that Biden is a figure from the past."" York was joined by Fox News contributor and former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz R-Ut., who echoed his critique of the former vice president. BIDEN GAFFES, FITNESS FOR OFFICE COME UNDER FIRE IN NEW TRUMP CAMPAIGN VIDEO ""I've just never met anyone that said 'Please, Joe Biden, I want him to be president', and there's an enthusiasm gap that he suffers from. He just can't get people to a Biden rally,"" he said contrasting Biden's rally turnout to President Trump's significantly larger campaign crowds in 2016. ""Look at the way Trump did it... when he wasn't on top of the polls he would show up with a couple tweets -- I remember he showed up in Las Vegas with like 25,000 people showing up and you don't see that organically on the Democratic side.  You see it a little bit with Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren has one to two rallies, but not to the degree that Donald Trump does,"" he continued. JIMMY CARTER SAYS HE HOPES 'THERE'S AN AGE LIMIT FOR PRESIDENCY' IN APPARENT JAB AT BIDEN, SANDERS Biden’s been largely brushing off criticism that he’s too old for the Oval Office. Earlier this month, he told reporters he’ll prove his fitness through the grinding process that is the presidential campaign trail, and pledged to release his medical records when he gets his ""next physical” before the voting begins next February in the Iowa caucuses. Former President Jimmy Carter, 95, also weighed in on the issue, saying he couldn't have handled the presidency at 80 years old during his term as the 39th  U.S. president  from 1977 until 1981, when he was in his 50s. BRIT HUME CALLS BIDEN'S CONDITION 'WORRISOME' Speaking during his annual report at the Carter Center in  Atlanta ,  Ga. , last week, Carter said he hopes ""there's an age limit"" to serving in one of the most powerful positions in the world. “If I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don’t believe I could undertake the duties I experienced when I was president,"" he told the crowd.

"Katie Pavlich and Antjuan Seawright weigh in on how 2020 hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren will pay for 'Medicare-for-all.' Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , took a veiled shot at  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,  in Iowa Saturday for not moving to impeach  President Trump , suggesting that Pelosi's inaction enabled Trump to continue seeking foreign assistance in elections. ""Donald Trump did everything he could to obstruct justice. I read all 448 pages and when I got to the end, I called for the impeachment of Donald Trump,"" Warren said at the Polk County Democratic Party's Steak Fry fundraiser, referring to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report. ""Congress failed to act and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system,” she added. Her comments followed reports that the president repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to look into corruption accusations surrounding former  Vice President Joe Biden  and his son Hunter. NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT While many Democrats called for impeachment after the report surfaced, Pelosi reportedly has continued to oppose the ramping-up of impeachment proceedings. Warren, a  2020 hopeful , was just one of several to condemn Pelosi's inaction on the issue. ""This is absolutely insane,"" Jon Favreau, who previously served in the Obama administration, tweeted. ""We have lifelong conservatives writing pieces about how Trump should be impeached and  @SpeakerPelosi  ’s advisers are still telling reporters they refuse to hold the President accountable."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Favreau was responding a tweet by CNBC's John Harwood, which claimed that one of Pelosi's advisers put the kibosh on impeachment. Actress Debra Messing was similarly outraged, calling Pelosi's reluctance ""INSANITY."" ""I am so infuriated at the Dem Leadership. What the f--k has to happen before doing the RIGHT THING is the GUIDING PRINCIPLE. This is destroying our country AND our party. Waiting for permission from the GOP to act is pure COWARDICE and DERELICTION OF DUTY. ACT!!"" she  tweeted on Saturday."
"""This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power to get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things if that's what happened, that appears to be what happened ... This is outrageous,"" the former vice president and 2020 Democratic candidate told reporters on Saturday before attending the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry in Des Moines, Iowa. Biden's comments come following news that  Trump pressed Ukrainian President Vologymyr Zelensky  in a July 25 phone call to investigate Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the situation. Trump has defended the call, dubbing criticism of it a ""Ukraine Witch Hunt.""  There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Speaking to local media Saturday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said he didn't think Trump had tried pressuring Zelensky during the July call, but he stopped short of saying the subject of Biden's son wasn't raised.  ""There was talk ... leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on a lot of questions, sometimes requiring serious answers,"" Prystaiko said. Biden, when asked by reporters Saturday how many times he had discussed his son Hunter's overseas business affairs, said, ""I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,"" telling the reporter who posed the question: ""You should be looking at Trump."" ""Trump is doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum and he is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" he said, growing increasingly irritated. ""Everybody looked at this and everybody who's looked at it said there's nothing there. Ask the right question."" Trump on Sunday pointed to what he says is an inconsistency in Biden's statement, telling reporters Biden ""made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son."" Hunter Biden, according to a story  published in The New Yorker in July , said he and his father had previously discussed the matter one time, saying: ""Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing,' and I said, 'I do.' "" On Saturday, Biden turned to the Democrat's 2020 presidential challenge to Trump, calling the President a ""serial abuser,"" repeating that he knows what he's up against but that Trump ""crossed the line."" ""A serial abuser, that's what this guy is,"" Biden said. ""He abuses power everywhere he can. If he sees any threat to his staying in power -- he'll do whatever he has to do. But this crosses the line. This crossed the line."" When asked if Trump should be impeached for the call, Biden replied that ""depending on what the House finds, he could be impeached,"" but he declined to go further in calling for impeachment.  Biden also called for Trump to release the transcript of his call with Zelensky to Congress. Biden isn't alone in demanding details from the call. Earlier this month, the chairmen of the House committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight announced an investigation into allegations that Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani had pressured the Ukrainian government to back Trump's reelection campaign. The lawmakers requested a transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and the Ukrainian president -- which reports later identified as the date Trump allegedly asked for an investigation into Biden's son. Later Saturday, California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, promised ""something very big, early next week if we don't get the documents that we've asked for."" ""We're going to take very aggressive action,"" Khanna told CNN's S.E. Cupp on Saturday, refusing to provide particulars. ""It could be anything from subpoenaing people who were possibly involved in the call to doing everything possible to get the documents that we believe that we're owed."" This story has been updated to note what Trump says is an inconsistency in Biden's comment concerning discussions with his son."
"Trump, Biden clash over whistleblower claims; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' all-star panel. Democratic Rep. Al Green  had a dire warning for his Democratic colleagues on Monday, suggesting that they will suffer the consequences at the ballot box if they don't impeach  President Trump . The impeachment debate was renewed last week after a ""whistleblower"" raised an issue about a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during which the president reportedly attempted to leverage financial aid in exchange for an investigation into Hunter Biden, son of  former Vice President Joe Biden . The Texas lawmaker, who was one of the first on Capitol Hill to push for impeachment, continued his efforts at a pro-impeachment rally. ""If we don’t do this rather quickly, the public is going to turn on us,"" Green  told the crowd . ""And we are going to find that those who went to the polls and gave us this great majority are going to be very disappointed. They are not going to side with us when we did not side with them."" REP. AL GREEN FEARS TRUMP 'WILL GET REELECTED' IF HE'S NOT IMPEACHED Last month,  Green blasted the president , calling him ""unfit"" and ""unworthy"" to serve as commander-in-chief. ""To defeat him at the polls would do history a disservice, would do our nation a disservice, and would not allow us to do what they did in 1868 when Andrew Johnson, who was the bigot of his time, who was impeached by the radical Republicans,""  Green  said.  ""We can’t let him walk the Earth without that stain... He’s caused harm to society. We need to do something about it.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Green also  expressed his concern  earlier this year that Trump would be reelected if Congress didn't impeach him. ""I'm concerned that if we don't impeach the president, he will get re-elected,"" Green said. ""If we don't impeach him, he will say that he has been vindicated, he will say the Democrats had an overwhelming majority in the House and they didn't take up impeachment. He will say that we had a constitutional duty to do it if it was there and we didn't. He will say that he has been vindicated."""
"John Yoo and Buck Sexton react. President Trump  nominated a slew of judges Friday to posts on California-based federal courts, ramping up efforts to reshape the judiciary after hitting a milestone earlier this month with the confirmation of the 150th federal judge on his watch. Two nominations are for the influential San Francisco-based  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , a long-liberal bench with jurisdiction across the American West whose political makeup has shifted with Trump’s aggressive appointment campaign. TRUMP TAKES ON CALIFORNIA OVER FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS Among the nominees is Patrick Bumatay, a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of California whom Trump nominated last year for the same job. But objections from California Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, over his lack of judicial experience and other issues, derailed the nomination. Trump later nominated Bumatay, who is openly gay, to a district court seat but his name resurfaced over the summer for a possible comeback bid for the Ninth Circuit amid a new vacancy.  While it is traditional for a nominee's home-state senators to give their approval, it is not required, and Trump lately has  bypassed the so-called “blue slip” tradition  in order to get conservative judges on the bench. While Democrats have fumed at the tactics, conservatives cheered Trump this month for seeing the 150th federal judge confirmed. “This is a historic milestone,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a statement. “As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will continue to push through highly qualified, conservative judges at all levels of the federal courts.” Graham and his Republican allies on the committee are likely to be receptive to Trump’s latest picks. Trump also nominated Lawrence VanDyke, a Justice Department official and former Nevada solicitor general, for the Ninth Circuit. Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, praised his record fighting “the overreach by the Obama Administration and its job-killing EPA.” Trump on Friday announced four other nominees for California District Court posts. But the Ninth Circuit has been a focal point given the sprawling territory it covers and its record in decades past of liberal-leaning rulings. Under Trump, the court has shifted more moderate with the addition of seven Trump-appointed judges. Nearly half of the 29 seats are now occupied by GOP-appointed judges. Last year, that number stood at six. NINTH CIRCUIT HANDS TRUMP WIN ON ASYLUM POLICY Earlier this month, the court handed Trump a win as it lifted a nationwide injunction on his controversial asylum policy, ruling that for now the injunction should only apply to states within the circuit. Trump also scored a victory from a California district court on Thursday when a Bush-appointed judge granted a request to block, for now, a law requiring presidential candidates to release tax returns in order to run in the state primaries. Democrats, though, have accused the Trump administration, along with GOP allies in the Senate, of destroying congressional custom by moving past consultations with home-state senators. Feinstein, in a floor speech over the summer about another Ninth Circuit nomination, said, “This disregard of blue slips represents another breakdown of Senate traditions.” She said screening candidates for lifetime appointments to ensure they’re qualified is a “critical” task and warned Republicans: “What goes round, comes around.” The latest nominations also come amid new legal battles between the Trump administration and California. Early Friday afternoon, 23 states banded together to sue the administration in a bid to stop its plan to revoke California’s authority to set strict fuel economy standards. That suit was filed in a D.C. federal court and does not fall in the Ninth Court, but California Attorney General Xavier Becerra touted prior rulings in his state that upheld California’s standards. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Two courts have already upheld California’s emissions standards, rejecting the argument the Trump Administration resurrects to justify its misguided Preemption Rule. Yet, the Administration insists on attacking the authority of California and other states to tackle air pollution and protect public health,” he said in a statement.  Fox News’ Gregg Re and Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report."
"The media is trying to protect 2020 presidential contender  Joe Biden  from scrutiny over his son's business dealings in  Ukraine , Fox News host Mark Levin said Monday on  ""Hannity"" . ""You have a massive Democrat scandal here and that's why the media is conducting themselves the way they are. That's why the Democrats are trying to turn this inside-out. To immunize Biden and to attack Trump, but it won't work,"" he argued, accusing Biden of obstructing justice while he was vice president to protect his son and a future presidential bid. Hunter Biden had been investigated related to his ties to a Ukrainian energy company. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE' Biden said in the past that the  U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden’s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AMID BOMBSHELL REPORTS TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE AID Levin scoffed at the media's reporting about a whistleblower who reported President Trump had exerted pressure on the president of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, possibly holding up a military package for Ukraine, as well. He said he's ""sick and tired"" of the president's conversations with foreign leaders being leaked to the media and to Democrats. ""I don't remember a damn one of those happening to Obama or any other president. Our president has to be able to speak to other heads of state without this kind of tyranny taking place!"" he said. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Levin noted that Ukraine's foreign minister  insisted  there was ""no pressure"" from Trump in the July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, but that remark ""doesn't fit the narrative"" that the mainstream media wants to present. The Trump administration  pushed back Tuesday  in the wake of multiple reports that the White House froze millions in aid to Ukraine shortly before Trump pressured the country's leader to  investigate  Joe Biden and his son. The reports coincided with a renewed round of calls, including from more centrist Democrats, for a formal impeachment inquiry. Those calls came a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she is opening the door to that route if the administration continues to withhold a whistleblower complaint apparently related to  Trump's Ukraine  discussions. Levin will interview author Peter Schweizer, who has written extensively about the Bidens' business dealings, on Sunday at 10 p.m. ET on Fox News'  ""Life, Liberty & Levin."" Fox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report."
"The whistleblower complaint has political implications for both President Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden; analysis from Fox News contributors Judith Miller and Dan Henninger. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., ramped up the pressure on  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , to  pursue impeachment proceedings against President Trump  on Tuesday, telling  Congress  that continual delay would ""betray the foundation of our democracy."" ""The people of this nation realize that if they had committed even a half of the possible violations, the federal government would be swift to seek justice. We cannot delay. We must not wait. Now is the time to act,"" he said. His comments came amid questions surrounding the president's conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the United States' decision to withhold aid from the nation. FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AMID BOMBSHELL REPORTS TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE AID Democrats say the president tried to interfere in the 2020 election by pressing for Ukraine to investigate corruption allegations surrounding  former Vice President Joe Biden. ""I have been patient while we tried every other path, and used every other tool,"" Lewis said on Tuesday. ""We will never find the truth unless we use the power given to the House of Representatives, and the House alone, to begin an official investigation as dictated by the Constitution. ""The future of our democracy is at stake. There comes a time when you have to be moved by the spirit or history to take action to protect and preserve the integrity of our nation. I believe, I truly believe, the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come. To delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Lewis also said that he went to sleep every night afraid that upon waking, he'd find democracy ""gone and never returned."" The president has denied any wrongdoing in his conversation with Zelensky and  claimed  that part of his decision to withhold aid stemmed from his desire for European allies to contribute funds to Ukraine aid as well."
"Although neither candidate holds a clear lead at this point, the new poll finds Warren and Biden well ahead of other contenders for the Democratic nomination. Sen.  Bernie Sanders ' support has dipped to 11% in this poll, with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor  Pete Buttigieg  at 9% and Sen.  Kamala Harris  at 6%. Sens.  Cory Booker  and  Amy Klobuchar  each land at 3%, while Rep.  Tulsi Gabbard , former Rep.  Beto O'Rourke , investor  Tom Steyer  and businessman  Andrew Yang  each have the backing of 2% of likely caucusgoers. The poll marks Gabbard's third qualifying poll for inclusion in October's Democratic debates. The rest of the field each notched 1% or less. Warren's improved standing overall in the Iowa poll comes on the heels of a stronger showing in recent national polls and is bolstered by an increasing positive favorability rating (75% have a favorable view, the best in the field, and she is one of only four candidates who have improved their net favorability since the June CNN/DMR poll), as well as a growing percentage of likely caucusgoers who say she is either their first choice, second choice or someone they are actively considering. All told, 71% are at least considering Warren's candidacy, ahead of the next best candidate on that score by 11 points (Biden at 60%). Her supporters are also more enthusiastic than those behind Biden (32% of her backers are extremely enthusiastic vs. 22% for the former vice president). The Massachusetts senator appears to be gaining ground primarily at the expense of Sanders. She holds the support of 32% of those who say they caucused for Sanders in 2016 (Sanders himself stands at 25% among that group), stands at 48% among those who consider themselves ""very liberal,"" and for the first time in CNN/DMR polling on the race, has edged ahead of Sanders among those under age 35 (27% back Warren, 22% Sanders). Biden's core backers remain behind him in largely the same way they were in the previous poll. Among seniors, he is the first choice of 35%, about the same as earlier this year. And he remains above 30% support with moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers. And Warren's supporters are a bit less apt to be locked in than are those backing Biden (12% of Warren supporters say their mind is made up vs. 26% of Biden's supporters). Overall, though, just 20% of likely caucusgoers say their mind is made up now, suggesting there is plenty of room for these preferences to shift before February. Shifts in favorability For many in the field, a summer spent campaigning in Iowa has done little to improve their chances there. Aside from Warren, no candidate has made meaningful gains in overall support compared with their backing among likely caucus attendees in June, and 10 candidates saw their unfavorable ratings rise by double-digits without an equivalent rise on the positive side of things, including a whopping 30-point increase in negative views of author Marianne Williamson, a 23-point jump for former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro and increases in the teens for former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. Sanders and Biden each saw an increase in unfavorable views alongside a drop in favorable ratings (Sanders shifted from 70% favorable and 25% unfavorable to a 58% favorable to 36% unfavorable rating; Biden's favorable numbers dipped 6 points to 66% while his unfavorable rating rose 5 to 29%). Yang also saw his unfavorable numbers grow, but the rise was matched by the increase in his favorability rating. Beyond Warren's gains, Buttigieg boosted his favorable rating 8 points to 69% without an appreciable rise in unfavorable views, Klobuchar saw favorable views gain 6 points to top 50% for the first time, while her unfavorable numbers rose 4 points, and Booker's favorability climbed 5 points to 60% as the unfavorable side gained just 3 points. Prioritizing electability Though views on the candidates have shifted, those likely to attend Iowa's Democratic caucuses remain more apt to prioritize nominating a candidate with a strong chance of beating Trump (63%) over one who shares their positions on major issues (31%). And most think that after Trump, American government could return to the way it was before his election (59%). The poll sought to gain insight into what it is likely caucusgoers think an electable candidate would be. Nearly three-quarters said a candidate who can excite new voters (74%) is closer to their vision of electability than one who would excite the base (16%). And most preferred a candidate who would represent a new generation of leadership (57%) over one with a long history in government (28%), as well as one who would take the high road against Trump (54%) vs. getting in the mud as needed to take on the President (35%).  Roughly two-thirds felt the more electable candidate is one who seeks common ground with Republicans (63%) rather than moving the country to the left (28%). But in assessing six positions that have become signatures of the more liberal candidates in the Democratic field, the poll finds wide variation in likely caucusgoers' level of comfort with them. Support for policy positions Clear majorities say that they are personally comfortable with policies that would raise taxes on the wealthy (74%) and restore the ban on assault-style weapons (69%) and they feel candidates ought to run on those positions. Fewer felt the same about the Green New Deal (48%), ""Medicare for All"" (41%), free tuition for public colleges (36%) and moving the country in a socialist direction (20%). Views on Medicare for All in particular are starkly divided between those backing Warren or Sanders -- the strongest proponents of such a plan among the Democratic candidates -- and those who favor other candidates. Among supporters of Warren or Sanders, 63% say they're comfortable with Medicare for All and want candidates to run on it, while among those backing other candidates, just 29% feel the same way. Perceptions on these policy positions are one sharp divider between supporters of the two top candidates. Among Warren's supporters, 64% say that none of the six tested positions are bad policy. Among Biden's backers, though, just 29% feel the same way. The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll was conducted by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, September 14 through 18 among a random sample of 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample of likely caucusgoers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points."
"""I'm in favor of moving toward impeachment,"" the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee told  People Magazine  in an interview published on Tuesday. ""I did not come to that decision easily or quickly, but this is an emergency as I see it.""  Clinton's call came on the heels of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement on Tuesday of a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, as House Democrats increasingly support proceedings to investigate the potential for impeachment. ""We are in a crisis,"" Clinton said, later adding that the House must begin impeachment proceedings ""not happily or with glee"" but to safeguard national security. Clinton cited reports that  Trump pressed Ukraine's President to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son  earlier this summer, and that he  requested a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine  roughly one week before the call, in her reasoning for impeachment proceedings. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. ""This latest behaviors around Ukraine, trying to enlist the President of Ukraine in a plot to undermine former Vice President Biden or lose the military aide he needs to defend against Trump's friend, Vladimir Putin -- if that's not an impeachable offense, I don't know what is,"" Clinton told People. Trump  asserted Monday that he delayed aid  to Ukraine ahead of the call but claimed it was unrelated to Biden, and remained defiant Tuesday that he's done nothing wrong and has no regrets about his behavior when it comes to Ukraine and seeking an investigation into Biden's son's dealings.  Clinton called Trump ""a reckless, corrupt human tornado"" and ""a clear and present danger to the future of the United States,"" accusing him of ""betraying our country on a daily basis"" and ""undermining the more perfect union"" of the United States."

"DES MOINES — Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is the new Iowa polling leader, narrowly in first place ahead of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to a new poll of the state from  The Des Moines Register and CNN . The poll showed that Ms. Warren was the first choice for 22 percent of would-be Democratic caucusgoers, a significant increase from the 15 percent support she held in June,  when The Register last polled the state . Mr. Biden dropped from a first-place June showing of 24 percent to 20 percent.  The result left the two in a statistical tie, well ahead of the rest of the pack. The poll is the latest evidence of Ms. Warren’s political rise in the 2020 race. Alone among the 2020 candidates, her campaign stops have become bona fide events, with 20,000 people attending a speech in Manhattan this week and 2,000 turning out in Iowa City on Thursday night. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont placed third with 11 percent, the second consecutive poll from The Register in which his campaign has seen precipitous decreases in support. Mr. Sanders, who placed in a statistical tie with Hillary Clinton in the state’s 2016 contest, had 25 percent support in the paper’s March poll and 16 percent support in June.  Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., placed fourth in The Register’s poll, with 9 percent. He had 14 percent in The Register’s June poll and has fallen in other surveys of the state since then before launching a television advertising campaign here after Labor Day. The gains by Ms. Warren come largely at the expense of Mr. Sanders. His polling drop-off comes as his campaign has reordered staff in early nominating states in an effort to reboot his campaign.  Senator Kamala Harris of California was fifth overall with 6 percent support. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota each had 3 percent support. Four candidates were the first choice of 2 percent of likely Iowa caucusgoers.  In addition to leading the field, Ms. Warren also has the most room for growth in the field — 71 percent of Democrats surveyed said she was their first or second choice or they were open to backing her,  the poll found . Mr. Biden was next, being considered by 60 percent of Iowa Democrats. Of the rest of the field, only Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Harris were being considered by more than half the Democratic electorate.  The dynamics are far from set: Just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers said their minds were made up, and 63 percent said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. The poll surveyed 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers by telephone Sept. 14-18, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. It was released after 17 Democratic presidential candidates appeared Saturday at the Polk County Steak Fry, an annual political event that drew 12,000 activists and voters to a Des Moines park for several hours of political speeches, campaign singalongs and freshly grilled meats. The poll, like the Steak Fry event, illustrated the increasingly condensed nature of the 2020 Democratic presidential contest. The poll found just five candidates registering more than 3 percent support, while those who braved the drizzling conditions and threat of thunderstorms congregated around the candidates who emerged hours later atop the polls. The event’s largest applause came for Ms. Warren, who repeated a forceful call for President Trump’s impeachment, and Mr. Buttigieg, who was followed by a yellow-clad cadre of highly enthusiastic supporters. Mr. Biden, whose campaign purchased the largest allotment of Steak Fry tickets, entered the event with a marching band and scores of campaign aides and volunteers. The lower-polling contenders for the most part roamed the grounds of  Water Works  Park here unencumbered. Mr. Biden was not the only candidate bringing some flash to the event. Supporters of the former housing secretary Julián Castro danced to a mariachi band, backers of former Representative Beto O’Rourke pushed a boat out into the nearby lake, Ms. Warren took 1,050 selfies and Ms. Klobuchar blasted the music of Prince, a  Minnesota hero.  For some, the event may mark one of their last major appearances in the state. Mr. Booker sent out a plea to donors today saying that unless he raises $1.7 million over the next 10 days, he will be unable to remain in the race. He’s not alone in being in danger of running out of cash."
"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Former Vice President Joe Biden  is facing accusations of  sexism  this week after he pushed back on a female moderator's question about his record. The incident occurred at the ""LGBTQ Presidential Forum"" hosted by GLAAD and the Iowa Gazette on Friday. One of the Gazette's writers, Lyz Lenz, seemed to question Biden's progressive bona fides when she asked about his opposition to the  ""Don't Ask Don't Tell""  policy and a compliment he paid to Vice President Mike Pence.

       ""You have also praised  Vice President Mike Pence  as a decent guy,"" Lenz said, drawing boos from the crowd. ""You're a lovely person,"" Biden shot back with a smile on his face. Lenz defended herself, saying that she was just ""asking the questions that people want to know."" According to some, like Time Magazine editor Anand Giridharadas, Biden's response was related to the moderator's gender. ""Last week, Joe Biden gave us an occasion to talk about 'racism with a smile.' Now he’s doing 'sexism with a smile.' Watch him grow angry at  @lyzl 's solid question -- and then try to slap her down in the most patronizing way,"" Giridharadas tweeted on Saturday. Jamil Smith, a senior writer at Rolling Stone, similarly accused Biden of ""Paleolithic behavior."" ""I admire Lyz’s professionalism in this moment,"" he tweeted. ""Sad that it was even necessary. Biden keeps exhibiting this kind of Paleolithic behavior, and too many folks will excuse it because they’re used to seeing their male elders act like way. There is no such thing as benevolent sexism."" Others piled on with critical tweets on Saturday. After the exchange on Friday, Lenz hinted that Biden continued his sarcasm as she walked off the stage. ""As I was walking off the stage with  @JoeBiden  he said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart,'"" she  tweeted. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The former vice president has also faced scrutiny for allegedly  inappropriately touching  women and his longtime support of the  Hyde Amendment , a policy blocking taxpayer funding of most abortions.  Biden announced he had changed his stance  and opposed the Hyde Amendment earlier this year, shortly after his run for the presidency."

"Trump joined  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi   at a rally in Houston  attended by tens of thousands, many of whom were waving Indian flags as both leaders praised each other's work. Breaking away from the staid formality of meetings at the White House, Trump took the stage with Modi at an event dubbed ""Howdy, Modi!"" at NRG Stadium. Roughly 50,000 people -- many from the city's large Indian diaspora -- were registered to attend.     Trump credited the Indian-American community with ""helping to strengthen our country and build our future,"" citing its contributions to medicine, business and technology.  The President praised Modi's leadership and touted the ""stronger than ever before"" relationship with India. He said India ""has never had a better friend as President than President Donald Trump.""  Trump linked his concerns about security at the US-Mexico border with India's security concerns about its border with Pakistan. ""Both India and US also understand that to keep our communities safe, we must protect our borders,"" Trump said. The President addressed those affected by the serious flooding in Texas, and pledged the full support of his administration.  Modi praised Trump, calling him ""warm, friendly, accessible, energetic and full of wit.""  The Indian prime minister appealed directly to Trump's crowd-craving sensibilities with a large stadium event, giving Trump a rally setting where he tends to thrive and feel invigorated.  The rally gave Trump an opportunity to appeal to Indian-American voters in Harris County, which has been at the heart of Texas' gradual shift from reliably Republican to competitive battleground. Modi, who is set to attend the United Nations General Assembly this week, could help give Trump a bump in his battle for reelection.  On stage, Modi introduced Trump as India's ""true friend"" in the White House, and he invoked Trump in his signature campaign slogan, ""Ab ki baar, Modi sarkar,"" which translates to ""This time, Modi government."" On stage, Modi replaced his name with Trump's.  He commended the Trump administration for celebrating Diwali at the White House, and he invited Trump and his family to come to India.  Modi said he is ""certain that some positive developments"" will come out of upcoming talks at the UN. ""President Trump calls me the top negotiator but he himself is great at the 'Art of the deal' and I am learning a lot from him,"" he said.  The event was the first of two events on Sunday with foreign leaders in battleground states. After the rally, Trump flew to Wapakoneta, Ohio, to tour an Australian-owned cardboard manufacturing plant alongside Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who Trump feted with a state dinner on Friday. The events were an opportunity for both Modi and Morrison to show the US President they can deliver in ways that are especially appealing to Trump. In the critical battleground state of Ohio, Morrison was expected to demonstrate that his country is contributing to the US economy and creating manufacturing jobs as the two men tour a Pratt Industries manufacturing facility. The events come as Trump continues to  face questions about whether he pressured Ukraine's president  to investigate former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, while withholding military aid to the country. Trump has defended the call, dubbing criticism of it a ""Ukraine Witch Hunt,"" while Biden on Saturday  accused Trump of abusing the power of his presidency . There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump will cap off his Sunday travel with a flight to New York, where he will  address the United Nations General Assembly  later in the week and meet with world leaders on its sidelines."
"""We cannot delay. We must not wait. Now is the time to act. I have been patient while we tried every other path and used every other tool. We will never find the truth unless we use the power given to the House of Representatives and the House alone to begin an official investigation as dictated by the Constitution. The future of our democracy is at stake,"" Lewis said in a speech on the House floor.  He continued: ""I believe, I truly believe, the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come. To delay, or to do otherwise, would betray the foundation of our democracy.""  The comments from Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and longtime respected member of the Democratic caucus, come as  members of his party are increasingly calling for the House  to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump. Lewis' remarks could help increase support for impeachment, particularly among members of the Congressional Black Caucus, of which the congressman is a member.  Congressional Democrats have been urging  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,  who has so far been reluctant to support impeachment proceedings, to change her mind on the issue in the wake of the Trump administration's decision to block the release to Congress of a whistleblower complaint. The July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which  Trump pressured the leader , according to a person familiar with the situation, was part of the complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or his son Hunter Biden. On Monday, Pelosi, a California Democrat, offered a fresh sign she's easing from her resistance during a brief interview with CNN, saying the House ""will have no choice"" but to ultimately initiate an impeachment inquiry. She did not say whether the move toward impeachment could be slowed if the White House provided the whistleblower's report."
"In a close race for third place, Vermont Sen.  Bernie Sanders  received 12% in the poll, followed by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor  Pete Buttigieg  with 10%. This is the fourth qualifying poll to show Hawaii Rep.  Tulsi Gabbard  with 2% support or higher, meaning she has now met both the polling and fundraising requirements to join the other 11 candidates who have qualified for the October Democratic presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.  California Sen. Kamala Harris got 3%, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Gabbard, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, investor Tom Steyer and businessman Andrew Yang received 2% each. All other candidates received 1% or less in the New Hampshire poll.  In July,  CNN's poll  with the University of New Hampshire found Biden, Warren and Sanders clustered at the top of the field, with 24% for Biden, and 19% each for Warren and Sanders.  Warren saw a significant jump in support from Monmouth's last poll of New Hampshire in May, mirroring other recent polling showing her increasing her backing in Iowa and nationally. She is up 19 percentage points since the spring in the new poll, while Biden dropped 11 percentage points, and Sanders dipped 6 percentage points.  Since May, Warren's support among those who describe themselves as liberal has increased 28 percentage points, while Sanders' has dropped 13 percentage points and Biden's down 7.  Likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire continue to prioritize beating President Donald Trump (61%) over voting for someone they agree with completely but who would have a hard time beating him (27%).  But most seem to think they can have it all if their choice wins the nomination. Almost 7 in 10 likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire said their candidate is the one they agree with the most, and over half (52%) said their candidate has the best chance against the president.  Warren holds the best favorability rating with 74% of likely New Hampshire voters who have a favorable opinion of the Massachusetts senator, 19% unfavorable. Biden's is down since May, with 66% who said they had a favorable opinion, 24% unfavorable, while Sanders receives 63% favorable, 28% unfavorable.  The Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone from September 17 to 21, 2019 with 401 New Hampshire voters who are likely to vote in the Democratic presidential primary in February 2020. Results among likely Democratic primary voters have a margin of error of +/- 4.9 percentage points."
"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 22 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com U.S. Rep.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  has apparently reached a boiling point over moderate  House Democrats ’ caution regarding the prospect of impeaching  President Trump . The go-slow approach is personified by House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi , with whom Ocasio-Cortez has had an often contentious relationship since the freshman lawmaker arrived in Washington just eight months ago. The New York Democrat told her more than 5 million Twitter followers late Saturday that the Democrats’ “refusal” to seek the removal of the president was a “bigger national scandal” than what she alleged was the president’s “lawbreaking behavior.” JUSTIN HASKINS: ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ PROVES AGAIN SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT Calls for impeachment have grown louder from some Democrats in the wake of last week’s news that a purported “ whistleblower ” had expressed concern about a phone call said to have taken place between President Trump and the leader of  Ukraine , in which Trump allegedly sought information about 2020 Democratic frontrunner  Joe Biden , whose son Hunter Biden  had business dealings  in Ukraine.  Soon after Ocasio-Cortez posted her Saturday comment, she received a response from James Fallows, the noted author, journalist and former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, who asserted that Ocasio-Cortez was overstating the case in criticizing members of her own party for exercising restraint regarding impeachment. LEADING HOUSE DEM TELLS PARTY NOT TO BE 'HASTY' IN PURSUING WHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGATIONS “IMO, this is ‘false equivalence’ of its own sort,” Fallows wrote. “What Trump is doing remains objectively the biggest threat, scandal, and problem. “Second-ranking: the silent acquiescence of the GOP Senate. “Then: it’s time for the House to act.” Ocasio Cortez doubled down in her response to Fallows. “It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law,” she wrote. “It’s another to let him. “The integrity of our democracy isn’t threatened when a president breaks the law. It’s threatened when we do nothing about it. “The GOP’s silence & refusal to act shouldn’t be a surprise. Ours is.” Ocasio-Cortez’s online outburst followed remarks earlier in the day by fellow progressive and 2020 presidential candidate Sen.  Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., who took a veiled shot at Pelosi, the standard-bearer among Democrats of a “wait and see” approach regarding potential action against the president. ""Donald Trump did everything he could to obstruct justice,” Warren said at an event in Iowa. “I read all 448 pages [of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Russia investigation] and when I got to the end, I called for the impeachment of Donald Trump. “ Congress failed to act ,” Warren added, “and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system.” Just over a week ago, Pelosi had  lashed out at reporters  when they repeatedly asked her about impeachment at a news conference. “Impeachment is a very divisive measure,” a clearly frustrated Pelosi said, “but if we have to go there, we have to go there and we can't go there unless we have the facts. And we’ll follow the facts and follow the obstruction the president is making ... and make a decision when we’re ready. “That’s the only question, that’s all I’m going to say about this subject, and there's nothing different from one day to the next,” she added. The struggles experienced by the 79-year-old Pelosi, a three-decade member of Congress from California, have included frequent clashes with Ocasio-Cortez, 29, and other progressive – and aggressive – young lawmakers who were swept into office during last year’s midterm elections. The progressives’ push for far-left policies, including Ocasio-Cortez’s  Green New Deal , as well as their vocal opposition to President Trump, have been at odds with the moderates’ typically lower-key approach to getting things done. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a  closed-door meeting in July , in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. The meeting was soon followed by the  departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff , Saikat Chakrabarti. But with Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter posts that began late Saturday, it appears the truce with Pelosi – at least regarding impeachment – may be over. Fox News’ Sam Dorman and Adam Shaw contributed to this story."
"The question this week is whether the President and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, abused the power of the executive office to  pressure Ukraine  into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, who remains a top-tier candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, making him a political rival of the President.    Reports of Trump's conversations with the Ukrainian president come as a whistleblower from the intelligence community has  filed an official complaint  with the inspector general related to the call, a person familiar with the matter tells CNN.    The inspector general concluded that the whistleblower complaint was ""credible"" and ""urgent"" — a level of seriousness that requires the Justice Department to notify Congress. The IG followed this protocol by forwarding the whistleblower's report to Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, who has  refused  to share it with Congress. On Monday,  Trump  laid into the government whistleblower, questioning the person's nationality and suggested that it is anti-American to report suspected abuses by a president.    In short, the executive branch is blocking the whistleblower's information from getting to Congress, even though the law is clear that such notification is mandatory in cases of this sort. For his part, the IG says the executive branch is  keeping him  from doing his job.    Only two months have passed since Special Counsel Robert Mueller appeared before Congress, concluding a nearly two-year-long investigation into whether members of the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Although many people have gone to prison over charges stemming from the  special counsel's probe , no one was ultimately charged with conspiracy with Russia, despite at least  one documented attempt  by Team Trump to accept political dirt from a foreign adversary.    During the course of Mueller's investigation, the President and his allies engaged in a full-throated assault on the institutions of power that were investigating Trump's inner circle, working to discredit the men and women charged with safeguarding America against foreign threats.    As I write in my new book, ""Crossfire Hurricane: Inside Donald Trump's War on the FBI,"" the President  blamed investigators  for conducting a ""witch hunt,"" and for being ""deep state"" operatives working to undermine his presidency. Without evidence, he claimed the FBI had inserted a ""spy"" into his campaign for sinister political purposes and castigated former President Barack Obama for allegedly ordering the  wiretapping  of Trump Tower.    Many national security experts, including me, believe Trump's goal in these baseless attacks was to help soften the blow of whatever might eventually come from Mueller's findings.    In the latest scandal, involving Trump's dealings with Ukraine, the President is drawing from the same playbook he used in his earlier attacks against the intelligence community: initially claim no knowledge of allegations of wrongdoing, eventually deny those allegations, claim that whatever was originally being described was actually innocent, and then wage war against those doing the investigating.  During the Russia investigation, Trump and his allies insisted that Mueller and his team were partisan operatives with an agenda, even though the key players involved in that case -- Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, FBI Director James Comey, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and even Mueller himself -- were  all Republicans .   President Trump has already started muddying the waters in the latest Ukrainian scandal, publicly blasting the whistleblower as a "" partisan ,"" even though Trump admitted in the same setting that he doesn't know who the person is. The president  denied  knowing which phone call media reports were even referring to, and then minutes later described the same call as having been ""beautiful."" And, of course, he has returned to a familiar lexicon, labeling the latest incident as "" the Ukraine witch hunt .""    As I have tried to warn the public ever since Trump's initial attacks on the FBI and Justice Department during the Russia probe, the President's efforts to undermine our institutions of justice pose real consequences to public safety. For example, FBI agents and intelligence officers rely on the public to help gather leads and serve as informants. A lack of public trust might mean fewer people will come forward to help guard against threats.    Furthermore, US intelligence agencies have the life-and-death responsibility of advising policymakers on serious threats to US national security. Political attacks on these agencies' credibility will only serve to undermine their effectiveness in the eyes of lawmakers and the public they serve.  If any president destroys that precious trust with the American people for nefarious political purposes, that president risks undermining democracy.    Trump may be lashing out because he has been backed into a corner, but publicly degrading people inside the intelligence community because their good-faith efforts threaten his political survival is no excuse for the war he wages.    As I write in my book, we have seen real intelligence abuses in the past. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the FBI and CIA engaged in gross violations of civil liberties in the name of national security. Innocent Americans were wiretapped without court authorization and spied on, as intelligence bureaus sought to determine their national and political allegiances.    What followed was systematic and wholesale reformative change by lawmakers once these abuses came to light. Congress passed  new laws  rein in the intelligence community and ensure effective oversight by the legislative branch. The distrust in intelligence and law enforcement in the wake of those scandals has taken decades to reverse.    If President Trump is successful at convincing his base that the intelligence community today is still untrustworthy, he will succeed in undermining these critical institutions in a way that might take a generation to repair.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi delivers remarks following Democratic meeting on moving forward with impeachment proceedings. House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi,  D-Calif., announced the formalization of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump Tuesday evening, saying ""the president must be held accountable"" for his ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections."" The speaker effectively endorsed the process, which to some degree has  already been underway , after facing fresh pressure from inside the caucus to act. The move could help Democrats' disputed  arguments in court  that impeachment proceedings were in fact in progress, which could entitle Congress to obtain additional documents. Pelosi specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky . Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal."" Trump allegedly pushed Zelensky to  investigate  former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden  has acknowledged   on camera  that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm  Burisma Holdings  — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had separately been accused of corruption. But there were several indicators throughout the day that Pelosi's gambit could backfire, as Republicans  predicted over the weekend. ""It is a colossal error."" Trump  vowed earlier Tuesday  to release a ""complete"" transcript of his call with  Zelensky  by Wednesday. Additionally, a senior administration official told Fox News late Tuesday that the White House is working as quickly as it can to release to Congress a whistleblower complaint, as long as it's legally possible. The official told Fox News that the White House had nothing to hide, that there has been no wrongdoing, The Wall Street Journal  reported  that the complaint must be declassified first, but will likely be in Congress' hands by the end of the week. And The New York Times  reported  that the White House had dropped its objection to the whistleblower speaking to Congress. That came after the GOP-controlled Senate passed a unanimous resolution seeking access to the whistleblower's complaint. WATCH BIDEN RECOUNT HOW HE PUSHED FOR SHOKIN'S FIRING Still, Pelosi appeared undeterred -- and she and other Democrats suggested to reporters that impeachment could be appropriate even for matters unrelated to the Ukraine probe. ""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella. ""The president must be held accountable,"" she continued. ""No one is above the law."" Invoking the ""darkest days of the American Revolution,"" Pelosi called on lawmakers to honor their constitutional oath to protect the country ""from all enemies, foreign and domestic."" The Democratic-led committees then would gather evidence and present it to Pelosi and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who would make the ultimate determination on whether to hold an impeachment vote. A Democratic source told Fox News that the House Intelligence Committee, led by California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, would take the lead in the investigation -- and that Nadler might not be pleased with the arrangement. “I don’t think he’s happy that he has less influence here, but everybody is on the same page and has the same role,” the source said of Nadler. Schiff “will have a heavy role here because the foundation of the Ukraine allegations is thorough his committee,"" the source said. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., responded to Pelosi's statement by noting that Democrats have been pushing to impeach Trump for years, for a variety of reasons. ""Nancy Pelosi may be Speaker of the House,"" McCarthy said, ""but she does not speak for America. ... What she said today made no difference in what's been going on. This election is over. It's time to put the public before politics."" Trump, for his part, ripped into Democrats in a series of  tweets  immediately after Pelosi's comments, writing that ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT"" was in progress again. ""Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage,"" Trump wrote. ""So bad for our Country!"" He added: ""They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!"" Trump is set to meet with Zelensky in New York on Wednesday. The visit was previously scheduled, unrelated to the whistleblower allegation, although the two leaders are expected to face questions about the matter from reporters. House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, called Democrats' efforts predictable and destructive in his own fiery statement. ""Democrats have been trying to impeach the President since the beginning of this Congress,"" Jordan said. ""Michael Cohen's testimony was a bust. John Dean's testimony was a waste of time. The Mueller report did not live up to the hype. ""Speaker Pelosi's decision to pursue impeachment now - on the basis of unsubstantiated, indirect, and anonymous allegations - only shows that the Speaker has finally succumbed to unrelenting pressure from the socialist wing of the Democrat Party,"" Jordan added. ""This was never about Russian collusion or Ukrainian prosecutions. It is all about undoing the 2016 election and the will of the American people."" Pelosi had met Tuesday afternoon with her caucus of House Democrats prior to giving the planned statement. Wary of  compromising  the electability of vulnerable Democrats in the caucus, Pelosi had long resisted taking the dramatic step publicly -- even though other top Democrats  have insisted , in  legal filings  and  the media , that an impeachment inquiry already has been in progress for months. Swing district Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., acknowledged to Fox News that supporting the impeachment inquiry ""could"" affect her electorally, but she maintained that Trump voters in her district ""understand,"" and that Trump crossed a red line. Republicans said the move would prove to be a major political mistake. TRUMP VOWS TO RELEASE TRANSCRIPT OF CALL WITH UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT ""It is a colossal error,"" Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn told Fox News just prior to Pelosi's comments. ""And, I’m kind of surprised that Speaker Pelosi, as shrewd as she is, would let it get to this point."" Pelosi's impeachment imprimatur came after a  flurry  of those swing-district Democrats late Monday wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post backing an impeachment inquiry, or a fact-finding look at whether an impeachment vote by the full House is warranted. And on Saturday night, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,  said  Democrats' failure to act on impeachment had been a ""national scandal."" Pelosi's decision Tuesday heartened Democrats who have long called for impeaching the president, only to be stalled after Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of Russian collusion by the Trump campaign. But, new momentum built quickly for the move after news of the whistleblower complaint surfaced.

       In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But, he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine  a ""disgrace,""  acknowledged that Biden had come up during the call and added: ""It's very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?"" BIDEN CAMPAIGN LIKELY TO END, AS UKRAINE ISSUE WILL 'BACKFIRE,' NUNES SAYS Trump tweeted Tuesday that he would make a ""complete"" transcript of his phone call public on Wednesday. ""I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,"" Trump wrote. ""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!"" Justice Department lawyers, as well as lawyers at the White House, have been advising White House officials to release the transcript since last week, a source familiar with the conversations told Fox News. At an  event Tuesday , Pelosi intimated that impeachment would remain on the table, regardless of what the transcript showed. Many conservatives charged that she was  moving the goalposts  and lowering expectations.

       ""We have many other, shall we say, candidates for impeachable offenses in terms of the Constitution, but this one is the most understandable by the public,"" Pelosi said, referring to the Ukraine phone call allegation. ""It's really important to know this: There is no requirement that there be a quid-pro-quo in the conversation."" Other prominent Democrats also seemingly said Trump should be impeached no matter what. ""The president has committed several impeachable offenses,"" Ocasio-Cortez told reporters after Pelosi's remarks on impeachment. In another indication that Democrats were apparently hedging their bets on the Ukraine matter, Ocasio-Cortez said alleged Emoluments Clause violations by the president could be included in prospective articles of impeachment. FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED Democrats continued to push for the whistleblower to testify and to see the full whistleblower complaint throughout the day.  Schiff, D-Calif., said Tuesday afternoon that testimony from the whistleblower might be imminent. ""We have been informed by the whistleblower’s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI [Director of National Intelligence] as to how to do so,"" Schiff said in a tweet. ""We‘re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week."" It was unclear if Acting DNI Joseph Maguire would provide that guidance. Maguire is expected to testify himself before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday -- but Maguire has refused to share some information, including the complaint. A  source familiar with the matter told Fox News this week  that the whistleblower had no firsthand knowledge of Trump's call with  Zelensky . Late Monday, attorneys for the whistleblower  released a statement  confirming Schiff's statement, and noting that they ""await a timely response from the Acting Director providing such guidance."" ""We support the bi-partisan, unanimous resolution passed by the Senate regarding our client’s lawful whistleblower complaint and call upon the Acting Director of National Intelligence to transmit the complete disclosure to the two Intelligence Oversight Committees,"" the lawyers noted. GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN As Pelosi met with her caucus, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, called for the Senate and House Intelligence Committees to immediately have access to the whistleblower complaint. The panels ""should be allowed to evaluate the complaint in a deliberate and bipartisan manner consistent with applicable statutes and processes in order to safeguard classified and sensitive information,"" Schumer asserted. Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., also released a joint statement Tuesday announcing an imminent resolution condemning the White House's failure to turn over all related documents to Congress. ""Allegations that the President of the United States sought to enlist a foreign government to interfere in our democratic process by investigating one of his political rivals – and may have used the withholding of Congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance days earlier as intimidation – are deeply alarming,"" Hoyer and Pelosi wrote. They demanded the whistleblower's protection, and for ""the Acting Director of National Intelligence [to] provide Congress the [whistleblower] complaint, as specified under the law, and all requests for documents and testimony relating to this allegation."" PENCE RIPS BIDEN OVER UKRAINE HYPOCRISY IN 'HANNITY' INTERVIEW Pelosi and Hoyer continued: ""On Wednesday, the House will vote on a resolution making it clear Congress’s disapproval of the Administration’s effort to block the release of the complaint and the need to protect the whistleblower. This is not a partisan matter, it’s about the integrity."" Meanwhile, Yahoo News  reported  that the GOP-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee had  written to the whistleblower's attorney, requesting a closed-door interview . The precise implications of Pelosi's shift on impeachment were unclear, given Democrats' previous rhetoric on the topic. Earlier this month, Hoyer contradicted some of his colleagues by insisting that Congress is not engaged in any kind of  ""impeachment inquiry""  -- before reversing course hours later in a ""clarifying"" press statement.

       Other top Democrats, including  Nadler , have insisted repeatedly in court and in public that an impeachment inquiry has been in progress. “It has been an impeachment inquiry,” Nadler has said. “What we are doing is clear. It has been very clear. It continues to be very clear."" But, when asked if he thought it was an impeachment inquiry, Hoyer initially responded with an emphatic “No.” Hoyer added: “I think the delineation ought to be whether or not they are considering a resolution of impeachment.” The  Justice Department , in court filings earlier this month, sought to block congressional Democrats' bid for secret grand jury material from the Mueller investigation by citing the confusion inside the caucus over whether or not they're pursuing an ""impeachment investigation."" ""The committee’s own description of its investigation makes clear that it is too far removed from any potential judicial proceeding to qualify,"" the DOJ said. A total of 172 House Democrats have now signaled strong support for an impeachment inquiry -- 235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with  one pro-impeachment independent . A majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. A highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Vice President Mike Pence would then take office in that scenario. ""The ironic thing is is that everything that our critics in the media are leveling at the president from this phone call, and leveling at our administration, everything that Democrats on Capitol Hill are running off and describing -- Vice President Joe Biden bragged about -- which was a quid-pro-quo -- withholding American aid in exchange for a specific action,"" Pence  told Fox News' ""Hannity""  on Monday. Fox News' Chad Pergram, Brooke Singman, Ronn Blitzer and Jake Gibson contributed to this report."
"Zelensky, a former comedian, secured a  landslide election victory in April . With no previous experience as a politician, he has to confront Russia's occupation of Crimea, as well as the ongoing conflict in the eastern region of Donbas with Russia-backed separatists. This may be a unique moment in the modern history of Ukraine. Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Trump, who are driven by their own respective political agendas, have suddenly inserted themselves in the midst of what could become an international imbroglio with Ukraine. But Putin, Trump and Zelensky have converging interests, and all three could potentially come out as winners in a scenario that leads to the withdrawal of Russian troops from eastern Ukraine, lifted sanctions on Russia, and the reelection of Trump. Ukraine has played a  key role in Russia's success  long before President Vladimir Putin rose to power. Ukraine's  fertile black-earth farmland  has long been a key Russian breadbasket, while the Donbas region is a major locus of heavy industry and  mineral reserves . Its Black Sea ports, particularly in Crimea, are  crucial to the Russian navy .  Even after the fall of the Soviet Union and Ukraine's independence, its rulers were often inclined to maintain  amicable relations  with Russia. In 2014, when the Maidan revolution toppled the pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Russian forces blithely moved in and annexed Crimea, then sent anonymous paramilitary forces known as ""little green men"" i nto the heart of Donbas . The European Union, along with the US, levied a series of tough  economic sanctions   that continue to weigh heavily  on the Russian economy. More than five years after the annexation, Putin remains desperate for these sanctions to be lifted. Now, Ukraine appears to have become at least as critically important to Donald Trump, for a whole different set of reasons. It is here, Trump seems to believe, that he can pin charges of  corruption on the son of Vice President Joe Biden , a Democratic candidate he clearly fears. And suddenly, both he and Putin appear now to have a Ukrainian president in power who is at the very least open for dialogue. At first,  Zelensky  supported Ukraine's eventual membership in the  European Union and NATO —both moves utterly anathema to Putin. Then the new Ukrainian leader proposed  ending the war  with Russian-backed forces in the Donbas by negotiating with Putin, and struck a hostage exchange with the Russian president that was lauded by President Trump as a ""first giant step to peace."" But he has also been especially interested in  ending the rampant corruption  that marked the  rule of his predecessor ,  Petro Poroshenko . Which is what seemed to give an opening to Donald Trump. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is  interested in what he describes as  Biden's efforts to oust Ukraine's top prosecutor because of an investigation into the natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where the former vice president's son Hunter Biden, had a role on the board  The allegation against the Bidens has been debunked by respected fact-checking teams at news organizations including CNN. At least one former official in the prosecutor's office  said the investigation into Burisma had already been shelved  by the time Joe Biden was pressuring Ukraine to replace its top prosecutor, who was unpopular among many Western leaders due to concerns regarding corruption. It's also unclear if Hunter Biden was a focus of that investigation when it was occurring.  Despite this, it appears Trump and Giuliani believe Zelensky should look into the matter. In May, Giuliani  abruptly canceled his trip to Ukraine  a day after he announced his intentions to meet with Zelensky in Kiev. Instead, he traveled to Spain in August,  and met with Andriy Yermak , a lawyer who serves as the president's aide.  According to  Politico , the State Department said that the meeting had been facilitated by  Kurt Volker , who has served abroad under four American presidents and is currently  executive director  of the McCain Institute for International Leadership and US Special Representative for Ukraine. I have known Volker as an individual of the utmost probity, and he, like the most seasoned American diplomats, clearly understands the need for all sides to feel as though they are coming out as winners. Which may be where the interest of all three key players converge. Consider this scenario. Putin would no doubt very much like to see a second term for Trump. Already, the American president is pressing fellow members of the G7 to welcome Putin back into the club next year, and floating the  idea that he will host the summit at his Miami golf resort . If Trump wins the 2020 election, he'll be freed from any need to win the support of voters. Trump would also presumably be free to move toward lifting sanctions against Russia, no matter how strenuously Congress -- and the rest of the western alliance -- might protest.  Zelensky, for his part, could do a big favor for Putin by digging into whatever Giuliani might want to help his client's presidential re-election effort. Putin, in turn, might even reciprocate by easing up on military actions in Donbas (though it is unlikely ever to return Crimea to Ukraine). In the Oval Office on Friday, Trump suggested he was not acting in his own personal interest by  saying  ""I always look for the conversation that's going to help the United States the most."" In the same discussion, he also described the whistleblower, who filed an official complaint,  as having a ""partisan"" agenda . Clearly hedging his own bets, Zelensky has held at least two c onversations with the Russian leader , and is also keen to  forge ties with the US .  The US released a $250 million military aid package days after  three House committees announced  a wide-ranging probe that would, among other things, look into whether such packages were being held hostage for the president's own political benefit. It is not unreasonable to expect that any future transactions would be smoothed by congenial relations between Zelensky and Trump, or even Putin. The key question: will Ukraine's new president calculate that he can win big points with the Kremlin by giving a little help to Trump, Giuliani and their campaign from more than 5,000 miles away? And how might this play out the next time Zelensky faces re-election, after winning a landslide victory on an anti-corruption campaign? Some of this could be sorted out next week in New York since, as the  Kyiv Post reported,  Trump and Zelensky might actually meet during the United Nations General Assembly session. Putin will  not be on hand , as has been customary in recent years. Certainly, clearing the air sooner rather than later, however, would by far appear to be in the best interest of all three leaders. Zelensky, Putin and Trump will need to set forth just where their most profound priorities—and loyalties—lie."
"Vice President Mike Pence addresses President Trump's call to the Ukrainian president, whistleblower claims on 'Hannity.' Vice President Mike Pence  lit into the mainstream media over its coverage of the Ukraine controversy in an exclusive interview on "" Hannity ."" Critics have been relentless in their condemnation of  President Trump  over a whistleblower's complaint about the context of a phone call between the president and newly elected Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky -- while  ignoring allegations of unsubstantiated wrongdoing  by  former Vice President Joe Biden  and his son Hunter, Pence told  Sean Hannity. ""The ironic thing is is that everything that our critics in the media are leveling at the president from this phone call, and leveling at our administration, everything that Democrats on Capitol Hill are running off and describing -- Vice President Joe Biden bragged about -- which was a quid-pro-quo -- withholding American aid in exchange for a specific action,"" he claimed. Trump's conversation with Zelensky came as the Trump administration was holding up $250 million in military aid for Ukraine, money that the White House later released. The president has said he wanted European countries to pay more for their own defense, and  denied delaying any military aid funding. SOURCE SAYS WHISTLEBLOWER DIDN'T HAVE 'FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE' OF TRUMP CALL WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT Last week,  a whistleblower complaint surfaced  containing allegations  Trump  made a troubling and unspecified ""promise"" to a foreign leader later reported to be Zelensky -- touching off a Washington firestorm. On Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News the whistleblower  did not have “firsthand knowledge”  of the conversation. The whistleblower's allegation could, however, prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. The former vice president has explained on camera that in March 2016, he  privately threatened then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko  that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor wasn't fired. To that extent, Pence told Hannity all Americans should know the full account of both Bidens' relations with Kiev. ""The American people have a right to know what happened. They have a right to know what happened in 2016 and they have a right to know what the circumstances were around having a sitting vice president threaten to withhold American aid."" BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN LIKELY COMING TO AN END -- THANKS TO CLINTON-LINKED UKRAINE BOMBSHELL, NUNES SAYS ""I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion,'"" Biden  recounted telling Poroshenko  at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'"" ""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And, they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pence's comments to Hannity  echoed remarks  made by Trump during United Nations meetings in New York City. ""Joe Biden and his son are corrupt, but the fake news doesn’t want to report because they’re Democrats,"" Trump said Monday. ""If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair."" Trump added: ""Look at the double standards, you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves…You got a lot of crooked journalists, you’re crooked as hell."" Fox News' Andrew O'Reilly, Jake Gibson and Alex Pappas contributed to this report ."
"Senate Minority Leader Schumer says it is the Senate's duty to take the 'national security matter seriously'; chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge reports from Washington. The whistleblower who sparked a mounting controversy over  President Trump’s  July phone call with Ukraine’s president did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the conversation, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News -- even as the issue fuels impeachment calls from Democrats. The source said that it is made clear  in the complaint itself that the whistleblower  did not have direct knowledge of the July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. UKRAINE CONTROVERSY TURNS INTO DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR BIDEN Fox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials are on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower is not one of those people. It's unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation, or learned of it another way. Democrats, meanwhile, have seized on allegations  that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden family’s dealings, citing those claims to revive calls for impeachment. Trump has denied wrongdoing. The new details, though, have fed into skepticism about the allegations from Trump’s allies in Congress, with some likening it to how Democrats  rushed to call for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s impeachment  last week. Some Democrats backed off after The New York Times had to amend an explosive story on new college-era allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh to make clear that the alleged victim did not have any recollection of the alleged episode. On Fox News’ “Outnumbered Overtime,” GOP Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah likened the two situations and called for restraint regarding the whistleblower complaint. “I think it’s fair to just take a breath, and say let's just find out the facts and see what happens,” he said. CNN first reported  on questions about the whistleblower's direct knowledge of communications with Ukraine's leader. In spite of those questions, the complaint has resulted in a showdown with Congress, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire refused to share details of it with lawmakers. Democrats are pressing for the release of documents related to the complaint. Biden on Monday tweeted, ""release the transcript of the call."" GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN “I write to urge that you and the Senate Republican majority take immediate action to stop President Trump from withholding an intelligence community whistleblower complaint that by law must be transmitted to Congress, and to begin an investigation into the administration’s handling of security assistance to Ukraine,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls for impeachment inspired by other alleged Trump transgressions, said Sunday that unless Maguire provides information about the whistleblower complaint to Congress, administration officials ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation."" But in a letter last week, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ODNI), Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of ""urgent concern."" He said the complaint ""concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision."" The inspector general for the intelligence community has clashed with the ODNI on the matter, however, and has advocated for the complaint's release to Congress. Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to return focus to Biden. Trump allies have claimed Biden’s son, Hunter, improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioned whether his father, the onetime vice president, helped protect him by seeking the ouster of prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was looking into the company's owner. Trump, in a Sunday night tweet, said the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin. Hunter Biden was hired by Burisma in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted by protesters and as his father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Two years later, Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless Shokin was fired. Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner. “The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” Monday. Fox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But the controversy flew largely under the radar until now. While the heat is on Trump over whether he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context. Fox News’ Catherine Herridge, Chad Pergram and Ronn Blitzer and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

"Fox News contributor Andrew Napolitano on the potential legal fallout from the whistleblower controversy. A slew of key swing-district  Democrats  late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as  The New York Times ,  The Washington Post  and  The Wall Street Journal  reported in the evening that President Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  strongly suggested  she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed. ""The horse is out of the barn,"" said former Hillary Clinton  pollster and strategist   Geoff Garin . ""Saddle up."" In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. He also called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine  a ""disgrace,""  and added: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?” Joe Biden  has acknowledged  that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm  Burisma Holdings  — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump has long said he wants European countries to pay more for their own defense, and an administration official  told the Journal  that Trump's actions on the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July ""reflected the president’s concerns about how the U.S. is spending aid money and whether U.S. allies are adequately contributing."" Another official told the paper that the Trump administration internally maintained at the time that Ukraine's corruption problems were a consideration in the aid decision. Trump's decision to freeze Ukraine funding reportedly came more than a week before his call with Zelensky. ""The horse is out of the barn. Saddle up."" Fox News has not independently confirmed the reports, which rocked Capitol Hill even as Democrats insisted they were keeping the developments in perspective. While Democrats are set to meet Tuesday to discuss Ukraine and possible impeachment proceedings, the top House aide told Fox News that trade – not Ukraine – would headline Democrats' agenda at a separate planned caucus meeting Wednesday. ""The dominant focus of the caucus on Wednesday is trade,"" the aide told Fox News. ""A second caucus has been added to ensure adequate time for member discussion on the whistleblower matter and a number of other pressing matters on Tuesday afternoon.""

       Something of an impeachment inquiry dam broke late Monday, when seven centrist Democratic freshmen lawmakers who served in the military and national security announced in an op-ed that if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens for political benefit, it's impeachable. The lawmakers – Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia – come largely from swing districts where Trump is popular but voters split. The Democrats wrote in The Washington Post they ""do not arrive at this conclusion lightly."" “These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent,"" the lawmakers said. “These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do.” Later in the night, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz and Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell also endorsed an impeachment inquiry. Such an inquiry would not be an impeachment vote, but rather an investigative process that could quickly lead to actual impeachment. ""On behalf of the people who elected us, we must formalize and accelerate the impeachment process so that Congress, by exercising its responsibility under Article 1 of the Constitution, can provide some measure of accountability,"" Schatz said in a statement. The flurry of moves brings to 154 the number of House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with  one independent  -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. An unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president.) Democrats have presented conflicting views, in court and in public, as to  whether impeachment proceedings are already in progress.  The renewed push on Monday could galvanize remaining Democrats to openly call their efforts an impeachment probe. FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED Meanwhile, a  report in Politico  late Monday suggested that Democrats may vote on a resolution to condemn Trump for allegedly pressuring Ukraine's leadership to investigate possible corruption by Joe Biden's son Hunter relating to his business dealings in the country. And The Washington Post  reported  in the evening that Pelosi was sounding out members of the Democratic caucus to see if the time has come to impeach the president. However, earlier Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have ""firsthand knowledge"" of Trump's conversation with Zelensky. The source said that it was made clear  in the complaint itself that the whistleblower  did not have direct knowledge of the July phone call. Fox News has learned that typically, multiple U.S. officials would be on such calls with the president, but this would indicate the whistleblower was not one of those people. It's unclear if the individual read a transcript of the call, heard about it in conversation, or learned of it another way. SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL Nevertheless, Democrats have pressed forward on the issue, even as it risked backfiring by exposing potential wrongdoing by the former vice president. ""The Senate Republican 'see no evil, hear no evil' attitude is unacceptable and must change,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Senate floor Monday. ""This again is an issue of solemn obligation. There is no wiggle room here, none."" The New York Democrat earlier in the day wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asking him to issue a subpoena and hold hearings over the complaint.

       In a floor speech Monday afternoon, the Kentucky Republican rebuffed those calls from Democrats, saying the Senate Intelligence Committee has been following an established process and was working to hear from the intelligence community's inspector general this week. ""It is regrettable that House Intelligence Committee Chairman [Adam] Schiff and Sen. Schumer have chosen to politicize the issue,"" McConnell said, calling for looking into the matter in an ""appropriate, deliberate bipartisan manner."" At least one Republican lawmaker has also called for the release of the transcript of Trump's call. ""At this stage, given the seriousness of the allegations, it’s very important that the transcript and potentially as well the whistleblower come forward,"" said Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, an occasional Trump critic and onetime presidential rival. UKRAINE CONTROVERSY BOILS OVER ON SENATE FLOOR Meanwhile, top Republicans including California Rep. Devin Nunes predicted in interviews with Fox News that the gambit  would backfire for Democrats. And in an  exclusive interview with Fox News' ""Hannity"" on Monday , Vice President Mike Pence said Democrats' accusations were about to boomerang. ""The ironic thing is is that everything that our critics in the media are leveling at the president from this phone call, and leveling at our administration, everything that Democrats on Capitol Hill are running off and describing -- Vice President Joe Biden bragged about -- which was a quid-pro-quo -- withholding American aid in exchange for a specific action,"" Pence claimed. Late Sunday evening, Trump sounded a similar note,  tweeting  the ""real story"" was that ""Sleepy Joe Biden"" had ""forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by the threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine."" Indeed, the whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. The former vice president has explained on camera that in March 2016, he  privately threatened then-President Petro Poroshenko  that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired. The prosecutor, at the time, was investigating possible corruption involving a natural gas firm with close ties to Hunter Biden. ""I said, 'You're not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'"" ""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And, they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. And earlier this year, The Hill  reported  that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros. At the same time, Trump  acknowledged Sunday  that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned ""the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."" The president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call. The whistleblower drama kicked into gear after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump repeatedly had asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham says Turmp is weighing the release of Ukraine phone call transcript. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday. Democrats have sought the full whistleblower complaint and testimony from the whistleblower. But Maguire has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi, D-Calif., warned Sunday. ""Thank you for your patriotism."" Pelosi went on: ""We must be sure that the President and his Administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President’s personal or political interest.""

       Speaking to CNN's ""State of the Union,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also said impeachment was on the table. Schiff previously has claimed to have  hard evidence  that the Trump team improperly colluded with Russia. ""Why doesn’t the president just say, 'Release the whistleblower complaint.' Clearly he’s afraid for the public to see,"" Schiff said. ""This would be the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions."" The top Democrats' rhetoric came soon after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday night kickstarted a  dormant, but long-simmering and occasionally explosive feud  with top House Democrats in the form of a fiery  tweet:  ""At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a closed-door meeting in July, in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. That meeting came shortly before the departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti. Fox News' Alex Pappas, Jake Gibson, and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

"Fox News contributors Karl Rove and Mo Elleithee on the importance of 'firsthand knowledge' and what it means for the controversy. Responding to calls that Congress be able to review the context of a conversation between  President Trump  and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Karl Rove claimed such a custom would result in disastrous consequences on the foreign policy front. In addition, Rove claimed Monday on "" The Story "" that the report the  whistleblower who brought the issue  to the forefront did not have ""firsthand knowledge"" of the call is an important development. ""It's a big news item,"" he said. ""It obscures some of the bigger issues that lie behind it."" ""What we know is, first of all, the president has a right -- any president -- to have confidential conversations with a foreign leader. TRUMP SLAMS MEDIA AS 'CROOKED AS HELL' AMID UKRAINE PHONE CALL CONTROVERSY ""He is, after all, under the Constitution, charged with the direction of American foreign policy. The idea that every conversation of the president of the United States would be subject to the call of the U.S. Congress upon whim would be an utter unmitigated disaster for the conduct of foreign policy."" In addition, host Harris Faulkner posited that foreign leaders themselves would expect confidentiality as much as America's head of state. Rove, a former aide to ex-President George W. Bush, said the issue should not be a partisan one. He said he believed that Trump would not want a private conversation with a foreign leader being publicized as much as Presidents Clinton, Bush or Obama would have. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""None of them would,"" he said. Earlier Monday , Trump tore into the press for their coverage of reports he pressured Ukraine's leader to help investigate political rival Joe Biden. Calling the White House press corps “crooked as hell,” a riled up Trump slammed the media for “double standards” over what he claimed was the failure of the press to report on allegations of unsubstantiated wrongdoing by Biden and his son, Hunter, related to dealings with Kyiv. “Joe Biden and his son are corrupt, but the fake news doesn’t want to report because they’re Democrats,” Trump said in New York during United Nations meetings. “If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair.” Fox News' Andrew O'Reilly contributed to this report ."
"The labor union's show of strength so far has amounted to nearly 50,000 autoworkers indefinitely on strike with the promise of being compensated only $250 per week. The strike comes at a great time for the scandal-ridden union. It offers the UAW the opportunity to restore its tarnished reputation with workers after several UAW officials were  implicated in a federal probe  last week concerning embezzled member dues. Expenses were reported for luxury items such as golf outings, expensive cigars and extended stays in private villas among other things,  according  to a federal criminal complaint. The union issued this  statement  in response to the probe: ""While these allegations are very concerning, we strongly believe that the government has misconstrued any number of facts and emphasize that these are merely allegations, not proof of wrongdoing."" It makes you question whose best interest the UAW has in mind. On Sunday they  rejected  a contract offer from GM that met several of the union's demands and could have avoided a strike altogether. Instead, both workers and the company will experience losses while the UAW tries to play hard ball. Surely, the UAW wants GM to experience some pain in order to demonstrate its value. But how long are they willing to wait it out when autoworkers' livelihoods are on the line, especially when a reasonable deal seems obtainable.  Under the proposed contract  submitted  on Sunday before the strike began, GM would have invested $7 billion in 8 facilities in four states, promising over 5,400 jobs. Additionally, workers would have gotten lump sum pay increases and an $8,000 signing bonus, among other benefits. It's not a total win for autoworkers, but it's a respectable compromise that warrants serious consideration. This strike goes beyond the basic needs and working conditions of GM employees. It taps into growing public support for unions.  According  to a recent Gallup poll, 64% of Americans approve of labor unions. Others are piling on, using the strike to advance a larger agenda for American labor like increased unionization and worker benefits. Union support has been expressed by many high-profile Democrats, such as Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Of the strike, Sanders  called  on GM to ""end the greed"" and Ocasio-Cortez  tweeted , ""In a time of record profits, workers should prosper, not suffer. That's why unions play a key role in an economy that works for everyone."" Politicians who truly stand with the American worker, should call for more thorough investigations into corruption claims like that of the UAW embezzlement scandal. They could also support the Department of Labor in their union transparency efforts, such as the recent  proposed T-1 Rule , which will bring transparency to union-controlled trusts and expose financial corruption in those funds. Both workers and GM are losing a lot of money as a result of the strike. However, the UAW is benefiting from its show of strength, as are politicians and pundits rushing to make use of the strike to advance their agendas.  For the sake of the autoworkers who want to continue making GM a success, the UAW needs to more carefully consider the best interest of workers."
"Media's Ukraine frenzy boomerangs back onto Joe Biden. Sean Hannity  opened his television show Monday by thanking the media for unintentionally making  former Vice President Joe Biden 's dealings with  Ukraine  a national story. ""We need to thank the mainstream media mob in their latest rage-filled psychotic effort to smear President Trump, they accidentally did his campaign and frankly the country a huge favor,"" Hannity said. UKRAINE PHONE CALL SCANDAL IS MEDIA STRIKING BACK AFTER FAILED RUSSIA HOAX, SAYS DAN BONGINO Trump is accused of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy into investigating Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, for their ties to a natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, which was being investigated as part of a corruption case. Hannity believes the media ""stumbled upon"" a legit claim against Biden. ""In fact, the media unintentionally stumbled on to what are serious credible claims of corruption surrounding one of the president's potential 2020 opponents,"" Hannity said. The host blasted the media's ""obsessive compulsive hysteria"" and argued that their Ukraine accusations are an extension of Russia collusion narrative. ""We have seen this now for over three years. And now that the Russia, Russia, Russia, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, collusion, collusion failed... they are now accusing President Trump of colluding with Ukraine,"" Hannity said.

"President Trump and others put increased pressure on Democratic presidential rivals; Kristin Fisher reports from Washington. An article in the  Washington Post  this week was widely mocked for comparing Democratic  2020 presidential  hopeful  Sen. Elizabeth Warren  to historical icon Frederick Douglass -- over the way they posed for photos. WaPo reporter Hannah Natanson began her piece by pointing out that 19th century abolitionist Douglass (1818-1895) ""appears alone in almost every photograph, staring down the camera in isolated, thoughtful splendor,"" while Warren ""features today in countless iPhone photos and Instagram feeds, her arm around voter after voter, always bearing the same wide grin."" ""The two are separated by race, gender and more than 100 years of history that forged an America that would probably be unrecognizable to Douglass,"" Nathanson wrote. ""Still, experts say, their use of photography collapses the distance: Douglass sat for scores of pictures to normalize the idea of black excellence and equality, and Warren’s thousands of selfies with supporters could do the same for a female president."" WARREN GETS STUMPED BY COLBERT WHEN PRESSED ON MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES TO FUND MEDICARE-FOR-ALL The piece goes on to cite professors who support the comparison presented by Natanson that both Warren and Douglass were ""smashing stereotypes."" “She’s presenting a public image of herself as somebody who is presidential,” Columbia University professor Alexander Alberro said. “What Douglass tried to do was to create a public persona in the face of the negative type of image of African Americans at the time … so I think the comparison is really good.” Louisiana State University professor Nichole Bauer suggested that even if Warren goes on to defeat in 2020, her ""million selfies are just a little bit more of a crack in that glass ceiling.” Still, the comparison raised many eyebrows on social media. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Journalist Jordan Chariton went even further, accusing The Washington Post of ""propping up"" Warren and ""defeating"" her progressive opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. ""Just when you think @washingtonpost can't get anymore absurd in their campaign to prop up @ewarren (and defeat @BernieSanders), they are now comparing Warren taking selfies with people to......Frederick Douglass,"" Chariton tweeted."

"The video included a  compilation of news clips  from Romney's 2012 general election loss to Barack Obama paired with clips of Trump's own 2016 presidential election win over Hillary Clinton.  Earlier Monday, Romney told reporters he believes a transcript of the President's conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, should be released. ""Understanding exactly what he said would be very helpful I think to determine whether the allegations, which are quite serious, are allegations that will have consequence,"" he said.  On Friday, CNN reported Trump pressed Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.  Trump on Sunday acknowledged that he discussed Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper, including  that he threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine  unless the country's leaders did his bidding and investigated the Bidens. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Romney also signaled interest in the administration making public the initial whistleblower complaint, saying, ""I think it'd be very helpful to get to the bottom of the facts to follow the law to get us there. That would include the whistleblower as well as the transcript of the conversation."" White House  officials are now considering releasing a transcript of the call , multiple sources have told CNN, amid mounting scrutiny over the interaction. Still, some senior administration officials, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, are against the idea because of the precedent releasing it could set with future foreign leaders. Trump has suggested he hoped to release a transcript of his conversation. Romney's comments Monday come after he tweeted Sunday that it ""would be troubling in the extreme"" if Trump did pressure Ukraine's president to investigate Biden, the President's potential 2020 Democratic opponent. ""If the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,"" he wrote. Before joining the Senate, Romney penned an op-ed in  The Washington Post  assailing Trump for not rising to ""the mantle of the office"" and distinguishing himself as a GOP lawmaker willing to criticize the President.   ""A president should demonstrate the essential qualities of honesty and integrity, and elevate the national discourse with comity and mutual respect,"" Romney wrote at the time. ""And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring."""
"After several months, when Pelosi resisted taking this step for fear of a political backlash, President Trump finally found a way to go too far. It turns out that there might still be a line in American politics, and he just crossed it.    As Democrats officially start the impeachment process and undertake the investigation, they will continue to be haunted by historical comparisons. Democrats who are leery about moving forward see the late-1990s impeachment of Bill Clinton all over again. With the 2020 election in the balance, they fear that their party will end up like the Republicans, moving forward to impeach the President only to encounter a fierce political backlash against their party for seeming too extreme.  Other Democrats, who have been calling for impeachment since the release of Robert Mueller's report, see a repeat of the early-1970s. In their minds, Trump is the new Richard Nixon, just on steroids. For them, moving forward with impeachment is not only the right thing to do but it will also strengthen the Democrats politically, by putting them on the right side of history.    The truth is we don't know how this will turn out. The trouble with speculation is that the future remains unpredictable. We can make educated guesses about how the politics might unfold and we can look to previous examples to better understand what is happening. But at the end of the day, the impeachment of Trump must be understood on its own terms.  This process will play out within the particular dynamics of 2019 and 2020. It is easy to map out how either prediction could be true. At the same time, it is even easier to imagine how we can't really envision or anticipate what is going to happen and what the ultimate political effects will be.   The impeachment process is always especially uncertain since it revolves around an intense investigation that sheds light on a situation rather than confirming what we already know. This means that, if the process is handled well, we will have many more facts on the table before any vote for articles of impeachment takes place.   While we live in an era where facts often don't matter and the people make decisions based on partisan preferences, dramatic revelations can still shake the status quo. That's what happened with Nixon -- the process itself dramatically changed public opinion. We have just seen that within the past few hours, as the heads of even the most seasoned Washington watchers are spinning.    Democrats need to make their decisions based on the obligations of the office and a respect for our democratic institutions. If there is one big lesson from the last two of our three impeachment processes -- it is that voters rewarded the party that in 1974 took this bold step but did so in a serious way, focusing on the health of our democratic institutions and the balance of power. When the Republican party seemed to move forward in a haphazard and clearly partisan manner in 1997 and 1998, the public disapproved of their actions.   Although politics is naturally always on the mind of any elected official,  this is a moment when they need to make those considerations secondary. It looks like Democrats have finally reached a point in their thinking, where they are willing to do what is right rather than what might be the easiest political path.    The outstanding question remains the Republicans and whether the revelations that keep emerging are enough to shake them out of a partisan slumber than has led almost all of them to be blindly loyal regardless of what the President does or says. In his latest statement, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not instantly jump to the President's side, vowing to  ""find out what happened.""  Given his history, the odds are that McConnell will stand firmly behind the Republican President. But the thing you learn from history is that politics can move in unexpected directions at the most unexpected of times."
"Fox News contributor Andrew Napolitano on the potential legal fallout from the whistleblower controversy. Fox News'  Judge Andrew Napolitano  appeared on "" Your World with Neil Cavuto "" Monday and advised  President Trump  that he shouldn't dismiss the serious allegation of ""political corruption"" levied against him. ""The president should not be diverting attention from the most serious allegation made against him, far more serious than anything ... Bob Mueller did, which is an act of political corruption in the ... formulation of foreign policy,"" Napolitano told guest host  Charles Payne . Earlier Monday, Napolitano told David Asman on Fox Business that the allegations against the president were the ""most serious charge"" to be levied against him. Payne asked Napolitano if the president should release a transcript of the phone call that sparked the whistleblower complaint.

The judge told Asman earlier that the Biden's presidential aspirations were likely done. Napolitano told Payne he was wrong.

TRUMP UKRAINE GAMES TIP DEMS TOWARD IMPEACHMENT Politico : “President  Donald Trump  on Tuesday shifted his explanation for temporarily withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, citing what he criticized as a lack of similar financial contribution by other Western powers to the Eastern European nation. Trump’s latest remarks are at odds with his assertion Monday that he denied the assistance because he feared bureaucratic corruption within Ukraine’s government. The new claim also comes after weekend reports that he repeatedly pressured newly elected Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky  during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President  Joe Biden ’s son. ‘As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid,’ Trump told reporters Tuesday, ahead of his address to the United Nations General Assembly. ‘But my complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,’ he continued.” Officials say Pelosi quietly making moves -   WaPo:  “[Speaker  Nancy ]  Pelosi , according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has been gauging the mood of her caucus members about whether they believe that allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate a political foe are a tipping point. She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. Pelosi’s conversations — and reconsideration of her long-held position that impeachment is too divisive — come amid a growing clamor for impeachment that extends beyond the party’s liberal base and many Democratic presidential candidates to moderate lawmakers in competitive House seats.” Moderate Dems join the effort -   Fox News:  “A slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that President Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son  Hunter . The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed.” Trump’s attacks on Biden worry Dems of 2016 repeat -   WaPo:  “But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, [the Biden] campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis. … The flurry of online attacks against Biden carries echoes of conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies about  Hillary Clinton ’s health and claims about her foreign entanglements that helped turn voters against her. The onslaught comes at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary contest, as the former vice president attempts to showcase his ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump. But with the Democratic National Committee attempting to be a more neutral arbiter than it was in 2016, when it was accused of aiding Clinton, the party helped monitor viral attacks but publicly remained silent.” THE RULEBOOK: PROVE YOURSELF 
“To reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor, is very often considered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert… and that the less he resembles him, the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents.” –  Alexander Hamilton ,  Federalist No. 72 TIME OUT: ONE OF A KIND  Smithsonian:  “The guitar  Prince  plays in [the  Purple Rain  video] was custom-made for him by a luthier at a Minneapolis music shop called Knut-Koupee Enterprises. … It made sense, even then, that Prince would require an instrument that didn’t resemble anything anyone else was playing. Knut-Koupee made three so-called ‘cloud’ guitars for Prince in the early 1980s. … In 1993, Prince gave a cloud guitar to the Smithsonian Institution, but he didn’t include any information about the instrument’s origins. But earlier this year,  John Woodland , the conservator for Prince’s guitar collection … reached out to the Smithsonian with a sneaking suspicion. After the guitar underwent a CT scan and extensive paint analysis, what they found was a shocker… This wasn’t just  a  cloud guitar, in other words, it was  the  cloud guitar—the instrument responsible for some of the most iconic sounds and images in American popular music.” Flag on the play? -  Email us at  HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM  with your tips, comments or questions.

WARREN CLOSING IN ON BIDEN IN NEVADA USA Today:  “ Elizabeth Warren  has pulled within striking distance of  Joe Biden  for the lead in Nevada's influential presidential caucuses. A new Suffolk University/USA TODAY Network Poll, taken after this month's Democratic debate, shows Biden at 23% and Warren at 19% in Nevada, the state that follows Iowa and New Hampshire in the opening presidential contests next year.  Bernie Sanders  is at 14%. While Warren trailed Biden, the Massachusetts senator was within the margin of error of the former vice president for the first time in a public poll in the Silver State. … Among the second tier of candidates in Nevada, California Sen.  Kamala Harris  was at 4% and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor  Pete Buttigieg , entrepreneur  Andrew Yang  and activist  Tom Steyer  at 3%. … The survey showed Warren positioned to increase her support as the Democratic field narrows. She was the ‘second choice’ of 19%, compared to 16% for Biden, 12% for Sanders and 10% for California Sen. Kamala Harris.” She also joins him upfront in New Hampshire -  Monmouth University:  “Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has joined former Vice President Joe Biden at the front of the pack in New Hampshire, according to the latest Monmouth University Poll. … Among registered New Hampshire Democrats and unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the February 2020 Democratic primary, 27% currently support Warren and 25% support Biden. The only other candidates in double digits are Sanders at 12% and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%. Others with measurable support are California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%), New Jersey Sen.  Cory Booker  (2%), Hawaii Rep.  Tulsi Gabbard  (2%), Minnesota Sen.  Amy Klobuchar  (2%), former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).” Gabbard is the 12th Dem to qualify for October debate -   Politico:  “Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has qualified for the October Democratic presidential primary debate, making her the twelfth candidate to hit the Democratic National Committee's thresholds. Gabbard got 2 percent support in a New Hampshire poll conducted by Monmouth University and released on Tuesday. The Hawaii congresswoman had previously gotten 2 percent in three other DNC-approved polls, and her campaign said she already racked up more than the 130,000 donors she needed to make the debate stage. Gabbard will join Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg,  Julian Castro , Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, Tom Steyer, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang onstage in October.” DNC raises qualifying thresholds for November debate -  Fox News:  “The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates. But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar. The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.” PLAY-BY-PLAY Boris Johnson  in a parliamentary pickle  -  WaPo Pergram: Why Democrats' push for DC statehood will likely keep stalling  -  Fox News AUDIBLE: DON’T GET IT TWISTED, BRO

The Altai, a tugboat operated by the Russian navy’s Northern Fleet, carried researchers from the Russian Geographical Society and other expedition participants into waters near a remote island chain called Franz Josef Land in the Arctic Sea, Ars Technica reported. The boat dispatched a smaller inflatable landing craft in shallow waters off Wilczek Island to bring researchers ashore near Cape Heller. Before the boat could reach the beach, it was attacked by a female walrus who was probably ‘fearing for her cubs,’ according to a press release from the Russian Geographical Society. ‘The boat sank, but a tragedy was avoided thanks to the prompt action by the squad leader. All landing participants safely reached the shore,’ the press release said.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

"There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  ""I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,"" Trump tweeted while attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Trump's pledge comes amid growing calls for impeachment. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  announced a formal impeachment inquiry  later Tuesday.  Trump admitted Tuesday that he delayed aid to Ukraine ahead of a call to Zelensky, when he pushed the leader to look into potential rival Joe Biden and his son's work in Ukraine, giving the excuse that he was waiting for European nations to contribute their fair share of aid and claiming there was ""never any quid pro quo."" During a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Joe Biden called for the Trump administration to ""provide Congress with all the facts it need,"" including a copy of the whistleblower's complaint. He said the Zelensky call was ""an abuse of power.""   ""If the President does not comply with such requests to the Congress, he continues to obstruct Congress and flout the law, Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment,"" Biden added.  The President is scheduled to meet with Zelensky at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday. When approached by CNN on Tuesday at the UN General Assembly in New York, Zelensky would not answer if it his understanding was that the aid for Ukraine and an investigation into the Bidens was linked.   Zelensky simply responded that his conversations with the President are ""private and confidential."" When asked if he wanted the transcript of the call to be released, Zelensky said, ""We'll see.""  Trump on Tuesday indicated that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had already received permission from Ukraine to release the transcript. ""Secretary of State Pompeo recieved permission from Ukraine Government to release the transcript of the telephone call I had with their President. They don't know either what the big deal is. A total Witch Hunt Scam by the Democrats!"" Trump tweeted. Trump has remained defiant Tuesday, saying that he's done nothing wrong and has no regrets about his behavior when it comes to Ukraine and seeking an investigation into Biden's son's dealings. Trump has previously branded criticism of the call a ""Ukrainian Witch Hunt"" and called the whistleblower a ""partisan.""  On Monday,  The Washington Post first reported  that the President had directed his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million of US military and security aid to Ukraine in the days before he spoke with Zelensky. When a deadline to disclose the whistleblower report to Congress passed and the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, proceeded not to send the report over, the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, notified House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of an ""urgent concern"" that DNI has overruled. Three House committees launched subsequent investigations into the issue. "
"In a rare strategy memo sent as part of a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday morning, Warren's campaign manager,  Roger Lau , announced an eight-figure TV and digital campaign in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.  The memo shared three examples of ads, all featuring the theme of rooting out corruption, that the campaign plans to launch, though it did not clarify which of the three would run online, on television or both, and exactly when the ads would begin to air. Lau noted that the campaign's biggest expense at the moment is staff but said he expects that to soon become media spending, with a bigger bulk of the expenditure going towards digital ads than TV.   ""At the start of this campaign, we laid out how Elizabeth is going to win the primary and the general election -- by identifying the deep problems the country faces, creating plans to solve them, and building a grassroots movement to win in 2020 and make big, structural change in 2021 and beyond,"" Lau wrote. ""As we head into the fall, here's how we'll build on our progress, build out our team, and keep growing the movement that will elect Elizabeth and elect Democrats up and down the ballot next November.""  ""I know what's wrong. I know how to fix it."" All three ads feature images of President  Donald Trump , Vice President  Mike Pence  and Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell .  ""I'm Elizabeth Warren. I know what's wrong. I know how to fix it. And I'll fight to get it done,"" Warren says in the closing of the 15-second and 30-second ads.    In the 30-second video, Warren touts her past accomplishments in Washington, including her role in the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and defeating former Republican Sen. Scott Brown in her first political campaign. It flashes a photo of Warren at the White House with former President Barack Obama.   ""I'll never let anyone tell me that anything is too hard,"" Warren says. ""Too hard to stand up to Wall Street? Too hard to protect consumers from cheating banks? Too hard to beat a popular Republican incumbent senator as a first-time candidate? Not too hard."" The full-minute ad begins with a biographical introduction of Warren's Oklahoma upbringing before transitioning to a familiar line from her stump speech: ""My second chance was a commuter college that cost $50 a semester."" ""Today there are fewer paths to America's middle class and even fewer second chances. Service members are targeted by predatory lenders; students are crushed by debt; families can't afford childcare,"" Warren says in that ad, which also features scenes from Warren's recent rally at Washington Square Park in New York City. ""And after generations of discrimination, people of color face an even narrower path to opportunity,"" she adds. ""When we have a government that works for the rich and the powerful, and leaves everyone else behind, it's corruption, pure and simple."" Investments beyond the early states Lau said in Thursday's memo that there would also be significant investment on the ground, including the hiring of new state directors and organizers in states that will hold primaries and caucuses well after the first several early states. ""We're targeting our resources to invest in places that will be critical to keeping the House, taking back the U.S. Senate, and regaining ground in key state legislatures in 2020,"" Lau wrote. ""That includes states like Illinois and California, where Democrats won a whole bunch of House seats in 2018 in close elections that we'll need to defend. It also includes states like Maine, which has a competitive Senate race and Georgia, where there will be two Senate seats up for election."" Lau made clear that the overarching aim is to put more resources into areas where Democrats are trying to either hold or flip congressional seats, as well as make inroads in state legislatures. Michigan, Minnesota, Florida and Texas are all on the list, he said. The goal: secure the House Democratic majority -- without which some of Warren's plans would be tough to enact in Washington -- and build Democratic power down the ballot to bolster support for her agenda. According to a Warren aide, all of the non-early states mentioned in the strategy memo -- Illinois, California, Maine, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Texas and Florida -- will have paid staff, including, eventually, state directors. ""If we want to make big, structural change,"" Lau writes, ""we need to make sure Democrats control the U.S. House and Senate and win important gubernatorial and state legislative races across the country."" Thursday's announcement comes less than a week out from the end of the third quarter fundraising deadline. Warren has vowed not to hold big-dollar fundraisers or solicit money from wealthy donors during the primaries, a decision that in part led to the departure of her finance director earlier in the year. But the campaign raised an impressive $19.1 million in the second quarter -- more than three times the $6 million she raised in the first quarter.   Warren has also benefited greatly from the transfer of more than $10 million from her Senate account. Unlike her current primary campaign, Warren's Senate reelection bid solicited money from big-dollar donors."
"""The president asked a foreign power to help him win an election. Again,"" the former secretary of state tweeted, referring to Trump's call during the 2016 race for Russia to look into Clinton's deleted emails. Clinton's tweet included a video of  Giuliani's comments on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time""  Thursday, when Chris Cuomo pressed the former New York mayor over conversations he'd had with a  Ukrainian official  about Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who had investigated the former vice president's son, Hunter. ""Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?"" Cuomo asked Giuliani.  ""No, actually I didn't. I asked the Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016 by the Ukrainians for the benefit of Hillary Clinton, for which there is already a court finding,"" Giuliani responded. ""You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden and his role with the prosecutor?"" Cuomo asked. ""The only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that (Yuriy) Lutsenko, who was appointed, dismissed the case,"" Giuliani said. ""So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?"" Cuomo pressed. ""Of course I did,"" Giuliani said. When asked about his contradicting answer, Giuliani said he ""didn't ask"" for Biden to be investigated specifically, but asked Ukraine ""to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme."" Asked Friday if he discussed the former vice president with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed"" but that someone should look into Biden. During the 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump called on Russia, China and other hackers to turn over Clinton's emails. ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump said in July 2016.  Then-White House press secretary  Sean Spicer later said Trump was ""joking""  when he publicly asked Russia to hack his Democratic rival."

President Trump accused Democrats of ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"" moments after House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi,  D-Calif., publicly  announced Tuesday that there will be a formal impeachment inquiry  against him. The news comes on the heels of Trump's speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.

Democrats have long been threatening impeachment against Trump, even after Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded his nearly two-year investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, but Pelosi has been reluctant to formally open an inquiry, worrying that it would doom her caucus coming into the 2020 elections. ""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella."" Trump announced Tuesday that he will  release the full transcripts  of his July phone call with Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky  on Wednesday after a whistleblower alleged that Trump tried to convince the foreign leader to investigate former Vice President and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. ""Secretary of State Pompeo [received] permission from Ukraine Government to release the transcript of the telephone call I had with their President. They don’t know either what the big deal is. A total Witch Hunt Scam by the Democrats!"" Trump said.

""The misguided Democrat impeachment strategy is meant to appease their rabid, extreme, leftist base, but will only serve to embolden and energize President Trump’s supporters and create a landslide victory for the President.”"
"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden addresses whistleblower complaint, says if President Trump does not fully cooperate with a congressional investigation then Congress will have no choice but to initiate impeachment. Former Vice President Joe Biden called Tuesday for impeachment proceedings against President Trump if his administration continues ""stonewalling"" Congress, blasting the president anew over his alleged attempt to pressure  Ukraine  to investigate the Biden family. The Democratic presidential candidate, speaking in Delaware, stopped short of endorsing outright  impeachment,  but the statement signaled he is opening the door to those proceedings -- which many of his primary rivals have already demanded. PELOSI TO ADDRESS GROUNDSWELL OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT CALLS INSIDE CAUCUS, AMID UKRAINE FUROR “It is time for the Congress to formally investigate the conduct of this president,” Biden said Tuesday, saying that Trump “should stop stonewalling” House committee investigations into his alleged misconduct. “If the president does not comply with requests from Congress … Donald Trump will leave Congress no choice, in my view, but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said. “That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.” Biden’s comments come after Trump vowed to release the transcript of a now-controversial phone call over the summer with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The move came after it was confirmed that the White House froze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine shortly before Trump allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. The White House contended that the reason for the freeze was tied to concerns about corruption. Multiple administration sources told Fox News on Tuesday that Trump wanted to be confident that the incoming Zelensky administration was going to take steps to end corruption before releasing the money. The aid to Ukraine also came up in the context of other countries and questions about whether they were paying their share, sources said. Trump, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, insisted he only sought to hold up the Ukraine aid because he “wanted other countries to pay.” “There was no quid pro quo,” Trump said. “There was no pressure applied, nothing.” A day earlier, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine’s investigative actions. “No I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said, also calling the Biden’s actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” and adding: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. … Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?” The furor began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week, involving claims that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Zelensky. A person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have “firsthand knowledge” of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, but Democrats nonetheless want to see the complaint. Biden demanded that the administration make the complaint available to Congress, along with other documents and information that's been requested. Biden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump and his allies have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate's role,  including that he apparently threatened to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine. As it happens, Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being overly soft on corruption. But Trump has claimed Shokin “was after” Hunter Biden, suggesting that Joe Biden was out to protect his son. FLASHBACK: TRUMP SAYS CLINTON-UKRAINE ALLEGATIONS WILL BE INVESTIGATED “The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” on Monday. “I can take the political attacks,” Biden countered Tuesday. “They’ll come and they’ll go, and in time they’ll soon be forgotten.” “But,"" he added, ""if we allow a president to get away with shredding the U.S. Constitution, that will last forever. This is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue and a security issue.” On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was expected to announce a formal impeachment inquiry against the president. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There are now 164 House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with  one independent  -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach Trump.

"The White House is making its own moves, making public a key telephone transcript and preparing to release to Congress a whistleblower's report as early as Wednesday, according to two sources familiar.  Politico first reported the White House's intention . One source told CNN the whistleblower report is under review and going through declassification and could be released within hours of the transcript release.  The investigation will test accusations that Trump sought to pressure a foreign power -- Ukraine -- into effectively intervening in the 2020 election to damage one of his possible Democratic opponents, former Vice President Joe Biden. ""The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said in a news conference. ""Therefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry."" Trump lamented the news in that it took the focus off his trip the United Nations General Assembly. ""Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!"" the President. Her decision elevates the turmoil and division whipped up by Trump's two-and-half years in power to historic proportions with massive political stakes for the 2020 election and beyond. Pelosi, after months of trying to slow walk impeachment demands from her liberal base, elected to strike, despite the  President agreeing to release a transcript on Wednesday  of a call with Ukraine's President. Trump says the document will clear him of wrongdoing despite his public admission that he pressured Ukraine to open an investigation into Biden and his son -- a fact in itself that his opponents argue is a gross abuse of power. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  Only two Presidents were impeached in the first 223 years of US history -- Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Now there is the possibility it could happen twice in the last 20 years, reflecting the fractured state of a nation split down the middle that has been further polarized by Trump's presidency. An impeachment inquiry would be the ultimate showdown between House Democrats who believe they were handed power in the midterm elections to constrain Trump, and a presidency that has repeatedly ripped democratic norms and tested the Constitution itself. Unfolding events Tuesday's developments unfolded at staggering speed in Washington and in New York where the President's ""America First"" speech to the United General Assembly was overshadowed. Trump decided to release the transcript under fierce political pressure over claims, first triggered by a whistleblower's complaint, that he threatened to withhold $400 million in military and security aid to force Kiev to open an investigation into his potential 2020 rival Biden and his son, Hunter. There is no evidence to support claims -- made in public by Trump as recently as Tuesday morning -- that the Bidens had corrupt dealings with the former Soviet Republic. At the United Nations, Trump put forward an alternative, retrospective justification for delaying aid to Ukraine ahead of his call to Zelensky on July 25. He said he wanted to wait for European nations to contribute their fair share.  Later, the President insisted in a tweet that his decision to provide the declassified, unredacted transcript -- opposed by senior aides -- would show that there was no quid pro quo offered to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!"" Trump tweeted. Some senior Democrats however insist that there need not be a quid pro quo for Trump to have committed a ""high crime and misdemeanor"" needed for a President to be impeached. The simple fact of a President asking a foreign leader to investigate a domestic political opponent is seen by many legal and political commentators as an abuse of power. Pelosi's strategy In an appearance in Washington, Pelosi warned: ""The President is making lawlessness a virtue in our country."" The House speaker did not specifically commit to an impeachment inquiry in the appearance and it's possible that the facts of the case will not merit, eventually, a full House vote on the question. But she shifted her position as a political torrent changed the shape of the impeachment debate in Washington. A number of moderate swing-state Democrats who she had been trying to protect, moved to the impeachment side of the argument. She said that the nature of Trump's alleged offense was clear -- a factor that might have changed the political equation. ""This is the most understandable by the public. And It's really important to know this. There is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation,"" she said. ""You don't ask foreign governments to help us in our election. That's what we try to stop with Russia. It's wrong."" Pelosi told her caucus that the impeachment would center around six House committees already investigating the President. It would be up to the Judiciary Committee eventually to decide whether to advance Articles of Impeachment. If the full House votes by simple majority to impeach a President his trial then takes place in the Senate. There is so far no suggestion, however, that staunch Republican support for Trump in the GOP controlled chamber is waning. That means the two-thirds majority that would be needed to convict the president on Articles of Impeachment and to oust him from office looks at this point unlikely to materialize. Like Pelosi, Biden also seems to be calculating his political position. As the subject of Trump's attacks and the Democratic front runner, he is in a unique position in the cascading drama. In an on camera appearance apparently meant to project presidential gravitas and temperament, the former vice president said that if Trump failed to provide information about the case, he would leave lawmakers with no choice. ""Denying Congress the information, which it is constitutionally entitled to, and obstructing its efforts to investigate actions is not the conduct of an American president. It's an abuse of power,"" Biden said. ""Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment. That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making,"" Biden said. Obstacles Democratic reluctance to move ahead with impeachment, despite what many in the party see as gross abuses of power revealed by special counsel Robert Mueller, has partly been based on fears of igniting Trump's base and causing a 2020 political backlash. Impeachment -- that can result in a democratic election being overturned -- is the most serious and consequential political maneuver available under the Constitution. It would tear at the fabric of the nation and trigger incalculable results and political forces that could reverberate for years. In another potentially enormous development, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff announced that the whistleblower who filed the complaint about Trump's conduct, wants to speak to the committee. The whistleblower has requested guidance from acting DNI Joseph Maguire on how to do so, Schiff said. Maguire had been under pressure from the White House and Justice Department not to turn over the whistleblower's complaint, but that appeared to change late Tuesday, so it was not clear how realistic are Democratic hopes of hearing the testimony. Trump made the decision to release the whistleblower complaint on Tuesday, a source familiar told CNN. It's unclear what is behind his change in position, though Pelosi told lawmakers she pressed Trump during a Tuesday phone call to release the complaint.  Two White House officials downplayed expectations for any bombshell revelation in the call transcript, saying it is expected to be ""underwhelming.""  One of the officials conceded that makes the release of the whistleblower complaint that much more important. But the official raised questions about the credibility of the the administration employee who filed the complaint about Trump's interactions with the Ukrainian President, referring to the employee as ""the so-called whistleblower."""
"Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff demands details of whistleblower complaint are disclosed to the intelligence committees; reaction from Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs, Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee. Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., on Monday said it was ludicrous for House Intelligence Committee Chairman  Adam Schiff  to  threaten to cut off  funding for the U.S. intelligence community unless the details of a phone call between  President Trump  and the Ukrainian president are made public. ""The very notion that you're going to defund our intelligence apparatus, that doesn't even make sense. It's ludicrous. If he wants to find a cudgel, he needs to go somewhere else. I can't imagine him getting support to do that,"" said Biggs on  ""America's Newsroom,""  noting the threats that exist from Iran, North Korea, China and Russia. Schiff, D-Calif., was  asked on CNN  Sunday whether funds could be withheld until the phone call transcript is released. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE' ""It depends on what funds we withhold,"" Schiff replied, calling it a ""blunt remedy"" that he'd be reluctant to use. ""At the same time, the inspector general has said this is not only serious...but it's urgent. We cannot afford to play rope-a-dope in the court for weeks or months on end. We need an answer."" Trump is facing renewed calls for his impeachment from some Democrats over a phone call he had with  Ukraine  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in July. The story was  first reported  by the Washington Post as a whistleblower claim about Trump making an improper ""promise"" to a foreign leader.  Further reporting  claimed the conversation was linked to Ukraine, and Trump's request for their government to look into  2020 presidential  hopeful  Joe Biden 's son and his business dealings. Biggs said he's skeptical of the accusations against Trump since Schiff is leading the charge. ""Look who's promoting this. This is Adam Schiff really pushing this. His credibility, veracity should be challenged,"" he said, noting that Ukraine's foreign minister  denied pressure  was exerted by Trump. ""The fact that he leaks stuff as the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, that's a problem, too."" GET THE FOX NEWS APP Utah Sen.  Mitt Romney , who has recently said he may decline to support  President Trump ’s reelection bid,  tweeted on Sunday  that it would be ""troubling in the extreme"" if the president appealed to his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter. In a tweet on Sunday, Romney said it was ""critical for the facts to come out.” Trump called his conversations with Zelenskiy “perfectly fine and routine."" Biden has said in the past  that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired. However, it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden’s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well."

"Rep. Kevin McCarthy defends Trump against whistleblower report. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy  defended President Trump Friday in the wake of a new report that claims the commander-in-chief asked the president of Ukraine numerous times in a single phone call to investigate  former Vice President Joe Biden ’s son. ""I think this president has been through enough. He’s proven he can do the job and why are people listening to his calls and selectively putting something out for political gain?"" McCarthy said on "" Special Report with Bret Baier ."" ""Let this president govern this nation. He’s proved he can do it economically,"" McCarthy said before adding ""This world is safer because of President Trump."" The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate. CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. Biden said on Friday that the claim has no credibility. Baier asked McCarthy if he had ""a problem"" with the reported request made by Trump, to which McCarthy replied that ""more facts"" are needed. Baier continued to press McCarthy, but he would not be drawn into commenting. ""You don't have any of the facts,"" McCarthy told Baier.

"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass.,  announced Saturday that he will mount a primary challenge to  Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass ., next year. The 38-year-old Kennedy -- the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy – formally announced his candidacy at a community center in Boston after weeks of rumors that he was mulling entering the race. AOC ENDORSES ED MARKEY, GREEN NEW DEAL CO-SPONSOR AHEAD OF POSSIBLE SENATE PRIMARY ""Donald Trump has forced a long overdue reckoning in America, and how we respond will say everything about who we are,"" Kennedy told supporters. ""We have to take on the broken system that gave rise to him in the first place — the outdated structures and old rules, the everyday oppressions and injustices that hold our people back.""

       Should Kennedy win, he would be the fourth Kennedy to serve in the Senate, joining his grandfather and his great-uncles John F. Kennedy, the 35th president, and Edward Kennedy. Edward Kennedy was the last member of the prestigious political family to run for Senate, winning election in 1962. The challenge to Markey, 73, is likely to leave local Democrats, including 2020 presidential hopeful and fellow Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., with a difficult choice of who to back. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,  has already endorsed Markey, with whom she has worked closely on the  Green New Deal  resolution introduced in Congress earlier this year. ""Ed Markey is a proud and strong progressive champion for working families -- not just in Massachusetts but across the country,"" she said last week.

       Markey, who joined thousands of young climate change activists who rallied in Boston on Friday as part of a global, youth-led day of environmental action, has the backing of many environmental activists. One of those groups — Environment Massachusetts — has vowed to raise $5 million to help Markey win re-election. Kennedy positioned himself as a more pragmatic Democrat when he was first elected to Congress in 2012, but has since adopted a series of left-wing stances. He has backed impeachment proceedings against President Trump, ""Medicare-for-all"" and the Green New Deal. In 2018, Kennedy gave the Democratic response to Trump's State of the Union address. Despite the blue-on-blue challenge, Kennedy has not yet moved to criticize Markey. ""Senator Markey is a good man,"" he said. ""This is going to be a tough race."" But Markey responded on Saturday by challenging Kennedy, along with other primary opponents, to a debate on how to respond to the question of climate change -- an issue he has been advocating on for decades. He proposed it be held in November. ""I was very disappointed at the Democratic National Committee's refusal to hold a debate on climate change for our presidential candidates,"" Markey said in a video message.

"President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani on his conversation with Ukraine officials. President Trump ’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani aimed to clarify what he said in a recent  CNN  interview about his involvement with Ukraine investigating Joe Biden's son Hunter, after the network’s Chris Cuomo accused him of contradicting himself. Giuliani first said no when Cuomo asked if he urged Ukraine to investigate Biden, saying instead that he asked the country to investigate allegations of election interference by Ukraine for the benefit of Hillary Clinton. He later said he did ask Ukraine to investigate a newly appointed prosecutor. Cuomo replied, “So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?” and Giuliani responded, “Of course I did.” When Cuomo called out the apparent contradiction, Giuliani followed up, “No. I didn't ask them to look into Joe Biden. I asked them to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme.” TRUMP: CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ‘WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT,’ TOUCHED ON CORRUPTION, OTHER ISSUES “The no was obviously wrong, I corrected it immediately,” Giuliani said  on “Fox News Sunday,”  adding, “I corrected it before he corrected it. The reality is, the distinction is this: What they’re saying is, I went there for, on a political mission, to kind of get Joe Biden in trouble. Ridiculous. I went there as a lawyer defending his client.” Hunter Biden had been the subject of an investigation by Ukrainian authorities based on his business dealings with energy company Burisma. Giuliani said the case was dropped only after then-Vice President Biden got the prosecutor fired and then had influence over the selection of his replacement. “You don’t get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country unless something fishy’s going on,” Giuliani said. He explained that his original purpose in going to Ukraine was to look into election interference, not the Bidens, but the two matters were “inextricably combined,” so one led to the other. “This is going to get bigger and bigger, and everything I say I can prove.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden has denied any wrongdoing, although he publicly said in the past that he threatened to withhold $1 billion from Ukraine if they did not fire the prosecutor.

"Media say he raised Biden in Ukraine call. As of today,  Donald Trump  is now the least liked president in almost 40 years. The September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday shows that 69 percent of voters dislike Trump. That is a toxic level in any race let alone one for the  presidency . It is impossible to improve that sentiment to less than 50 percent in the remaining 14 months before the  2020 election . Prior to this poll, the highest dislike of a president was 42 percent for George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina in March 2006. ANDREW MCCARTHY: WHAT IS TRUMP-BIDEN CLASH OVER UKRAINE AND WHISTLEBLOWER ALL ABOUT? In the same poll, 49 percent say they’re very uncomfortable with Trump’s 2020 candidacy. That’s compared with 41 percent for Bernie Sanders and 33 percent apiece for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Furthermore, a record 50 percent dislike Trump and his policies. Other polls show Trump losing a general election to any of the top five Democratic candidates for president. Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why Trump allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the front-runner in the crowded Democratic primary field. That should concern every American. It has been widely reported that Trump asked the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, eight times in a July phone call to investigate whether Biden, while vice president, acted improperly in pressuring the resignation of a Ukraine prosecutor whose office was investigating a company that employed Biden's son. Trump denies these allegations and the Ukrainian foreign minister said Saturday, “I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure.” It was also reported that Trump threatened to withhold $250 million in military aid from Ukraine if they didn’t cooperate. That money was released this month. Furthermore, Trump insisted that Ukraine work on the matter with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, not official representatives of the U.S. government. However, if these reports are  true, a request to benefit Trump’s political prospects, rather than United States or its national security, is illegal. Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why he allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner. Trump's acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, refused to discuss the complaint that brought this matter to light when he appeared before the House Intelligence Committee last week and refused to provide the whistleblower complaint to Congress … which they are legally entitled to receive. In addition to allegedly seeking assistance from a foreign government to interfere in our election,Trump has done nothing to secure our election systems. In June, the House passed the Secure Election Act, which authorized $600 million for states to bolster election systems. The act would require the implementation of cybersecurity safeguards for hardware and software used in elections, bar wireless communication devices in election systems, and require electronic voting machines be manufactured in the United States. However, the Senate had not taken up the measure because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was refusing to do so. Until last week. Out of the blue, just one day after the Ukraine story broke, McConnell approved $250 million for election security, a token amount that will provide only $5 million per state to fight the Russians and will  have little real effect. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER It seems McConnell, who takes umbrage with his nickname “Moscow Mitch,"" may have been trying to head off criticism about foreign election interference with this gesture. But it is just that, a gesture. There are 406 days until next year's general election – and only 133 until the 2020 caucuses and primaries begin – and the resources and reforms to guard against foreign interference are not close to what is needed. It appears Trump is so worried about his poll numbers that he thinks he needs outside help to win and  that no one can or will stop him … again. If that is  true, then Trump is acting in a decidedly un-American fashion. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He should be held accountable.

"DETROIT — The Democratic presidential candidates have been chasing labor support all summer, appearing at small union halls and large conferences, and tweeting support for workers at companies like Amazon and Walmart. But now, as the United Automobile Workers, one of the nation’s largest unions, stages a strike that has even drawn words of support from President Trump, Democrats are seizing the moment to align themselves with workers in public and dramatic ways. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts walked the picket line Sunday alongside striking General Motors workers at an assembly plant in Detroit. Not to be outdone, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appeared at another G.M. assembly plant in  Kansas City , Kan. The picket line visits of two of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination — with the third, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, planning to join striking workers in Detroit on Wednesday — illustrated the importance to Democrats of winning the support of rank-and-file union members, including those who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. Taking her message of fighting inequality to Michigan for the fourth time since June, Ms. Warren joined a scrum of striking autoworkers, carrying a blue and white “U.A.W. on Strike” sign. As they crisscrossed the entrance to the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant, where Cadillacs and Chevrolets are built, the workers chanted, “We are the union, the mighty, mighty union. U.A.W. stand strong.” Ms. Warren criticized G.M. for closing plants while making billions of dollars in profits. “G.M. is demonstrating that it has no loyalty to the workers of America or the people of America,” she said. “Their only loyalty is to their own bottom line. And if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to anywhere else on this planet, they will do it.” “Everybody deserves a living wage in this country,” she said. “Let’s be clear, unions built America’s middle class and unions will rebuild America’s middle class.” U.A.W. leaders in Detroit voted unanimously a week ago to authorize the strike, the union’s first such walkout since 2007. The union is pushing G.M. to raise wages, reopen some plants and add jobs at others, and narrow the pay gap between new hires and veteran workers. Nearly 50,000 members have joined picket lines  at factories across the South an d the Midwest.  Every major Democratic presidential candidate has expressed support for the striking workers, and several have visited picket lines to appeal to union members who may have switched their support to Mr. Trump. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota joined the one in Detroit on Thursday, while Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio traveled to several in his home state and in Flint, Mich. Addressing the striking U.A.W. workers in Kansas City on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Biden wore a red T-shirt in solidarity. He referenced the bailout of General Motors during the Obama administration, telling the crowd, “We didn’t bail out GM, U.A.W. bailed out GM!” He went on to lament the high pay of executives at the company and the lack of equitable benefits for workers, and he encouraged the striking workers, acknowledging, “you’re making a hell of a sacrifice.” “There’s only one reason we have a middle class, and it’s spelled ‘U-N-I-O-N,’” he said. The crowd cheered. Auto-worker support for the Democratic Party has eroded slightly in recent years, and  about 30 percent of the union’s rank and file  were estimated to have voted for Mr. Trump  in 2016, slightly more than the share who voted for the two previous Republican presidential nominees. The departure of those voters from the Democratic Party, even as the union had officially endorsed Hillary Clinton, was particularly critical to Mr. Trump in Michigan, where  he won by the thinnest of margins  — less than 11,000 votes — to capture the state’s 16 electoral votes. Nearly three years later,  it is unclear how many of those union workers continue to  back the president. The economy has generally remained strong here, with unemployment near a 20-year low. Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat who represents a district just outside of Detroit that is home to several auto manufacturing facilities, said she felt that Mr. Trump’s support among autoworkers had held roughly steady. But she said she believed that a prolonged strike could move the president’s numbers among such workers in one direction or the other, depending on whether they viewed him as trying to help or hurt them. “If he’s perceived as trying to keep the plants open, and it’s successful, it could have a positive impact,” Ms. Dingell said. In 2016, Ms. Dingell was a  lonely voice  among Michigan Democrats as she raised concerns that Mr. Trump could carry the state, even going so far as to hold a meeting with Democratic legislators in her district several weeks before the election warning them not to underestimate his appeal. Ms. Dingell said she had heard frequently from autoworkers at dozens of community meetings in 2016 that they were “with Donald” and that they believed he sincerely cared about trade. Mr. Trump last week expressed hope that the strike would be a “quick one,” complaining about General Motors’ decision to close domestic plants and open factories offshore, and taking a swipe at the company’s leadership, which announced last November that the company would close four plants in the United States. “I got tremendous numbers of votes from the autoworkers,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. “I don’t want General Motors to be building plants outside of this country. You know they built many plants in China and Mexico and I don’t like that at all.” While Mr. Trump ran as a friend of workers, some labor leaders have said that was largely empty rhetoric. In a recent interview on Fox News, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Richard Trumka, said workers were suffering, and criticized the White House’s inaction on the minimum wage. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump had said he supported hiking the federal minimum wage, currently at $7.25 an hour, to $10. “He’s opposed every increase in the minimum wage,” Mr. Trumka said. “He’s changed the regulation to take overtime away from a couple of million people. He’s proposed trillion-dollar cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. He’s rolled back health and safety standards toward workers.”  As a crowd of about 200 waited for Ms. Warren’s arrival on a sunny day, blocking the entrance to the idled plant, some sang along to a recording of Aretha Franklin’s “Respect,” the message directed at G.M. management. Many wore red T-shirts that said “Solidarity, No More Bull.” In many ways, Ms. Warren’s central message, which emphasizes the struggles of middle- and low-income Americans, appeals to the same frustrations that Mr. Trump tapped into in 2016 — pent-up anger at an economy and system that workers view as unfair. “Personally for me, this is a lot bigger than G.M. and the autoworkers,” said Mike Mucci, a worker who was on the picket line outside the Detroit plant on Sunday. “This is a fight for the middle class.”  Mr. Mucci, 43, who said he was not a fan of Mr. Trump, predicted that the president would “do anything he could to try to take credit for saving the U.A.W.”  Robert Hatline, 61, a retired G.M. worker who voted for Mrs. Clinton in 2016, said he was impressed with Ms. Warren’s plan to provide free public college. “I like what she says if she can do it,” he said. “I want to see student loans reduced off these kids.” Carla Duckett, 60, a team leader on the Cadillac line here, said she would support whichever Democrat the U.A.W. endorsed. “I just know we’ve got to support the Democrats this time,” she said.  Ms. Klobuchar, who delivered doughnuts when she visited the picket line on Thursday, described how G.M. workers had suffered during the economic downturn and how the company had “bounced back.”  “This particular company has been making a lot of money and that means to me that you got to share it with your workers,” she said. “And that means better wages, that means health care, and that also means the long-term benefits that our workers deserve. That’s what this is about. It’s about shared prosperity, that we’re all in it together.” Mr. Sanders’s Wednesday visit will follow a stop on Tuesday at a labor rally in support of the Chicago Teachers Union. In August, Mr. Sanders released his  Workplace Democracy Plan , which he has said would double union membership during his term and give workers increased workplace protection. Mr. Ryan, who cited the closing of the Chevrolet Cruz plant in Lordstown earlier this year as the impetus for his presidential campaign, joined G.M. workers outside the idled plant last Monday. “When a group of workers lose their jobs, it causes massive disruption in the whole community,”  Mr. Ryan tweeted . “Kids of these workers have to deal w/ either move to a new state & school; or the trauma of a parent being laid off. Educators are often left to help pick up the pieces.” G.M. last year announced its plans to close the four plants, including the one in Lordstown, with hundreds of workers electing to relocate to other G.M. facilities. The Hamtramck plant, which makes the Chevrolet Impala and the Cadillac CT6, is slated to shut down in January. The idled plants have become an issue in the negotiations, with workers also pushing G.M. to improve wages, add jobs at other facilities, pay a greater share of employee health care costs, and close or narrow the difference between pay rates for new hires and veteran workers. Pointing to a $50 billion federal bailout of G.M. in 2009 following the financial crisis, as well as union concessions, many G.M. workers have said they view the decisions as particularly callous. The company paid the government back most of the money. The Democratic presidential candidates have joined picket lines in previous strikes, including the McDonald’s strike in May and the Stop & Shop strike in April, as they jockey for union endorsements. But with a couple of isolated exceptions — the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America  endorsed Mr. Sanders  last month, and the national firefighters’ union endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in April — unions  have been holding back , many waiting until they see which Democratic candidate wins the support of the rank and file. Maggie Astor, Neal E.

"Democratic presidential candidate's plan takes center stage as Congress awaits White House proposal on gun control; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' Beto O'Rourke ’s hard-left turn on  gun confiscation  in the Democratic presidential primary may play well with liberal primary voters across the country – but the former congressman could also be hurting his political future in Texas should he someday choose to run statewide again. O’Rourke, who nearly won a Senate seat in Texas in 2018 against incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, declared in a primary debate earlier this month, ""Hell yes, we are going to take your AR-15."" That’s in contrast to what O’Rourke’s said in the 2018 race, when the Democrat sought to appeal to the gun-friendly state by repeatedly  telling Texans , ""If you own an AR-15, keep it."" (He also said during that race that he didn’t want more such weapons sold.) WOMAN WHO CONFRONTED O'ROURKE ON GUN CONFISCATION PLANS: 'SHAME ON HIM' FOR EXPLOITING 'OUR TRAGEDIES' In the wake of multiple recent mass shootings, including in his hometown of El Paso, O'Rourke  has proposed forcing  AR-15 owners to turn in their guns through a mandatory buyback program. The NRA  says  that Americans own over 15 million AR-15s, and that they are the most popular rifle in America for training and home defense. O'Rourke's campaign is now  selling T-shirts featuring his ""hell yes"" gun confiscation slogan. Cruz mocked O'Rourke's shift last week, noting that in 2018 he warned that O'Rourke wanted to ""take our guns,” yet fact-checker PolitiFact rated that claim “false.” ""PolitiFact — you non-partisan sexy thing you — so ... did you buy Beto’s shirt?"" Cruz  joked on Twitter . Texas political activists assert that O’Rourke can't win in Texas anymore with these positions. “O'Rourke's ‘hell yes’ to gun confiscation demonstrates how little he knows about Texans and rifles,” said JoAnn Fleming, the executive director of Grassroots America, We the People PAC, a conservative group in Texas. “By shooting off his mouth, Beto managed to end his political career in Texas, while driving up rifle sales.” O’Rourke’s rhetoric on guns has not picked up much support from his former colleagues in Congress. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who is negotiating with Senate Republicans on expanding background checks and possibly creating “red flag” laws, pushed back on the mandatory buyback idea. ""I don't know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O'Rourke,"" Schumer told reporters from upstate New York, according to t he Times Union . But O’Rourke hit back at Schumer in a fundraising email, pointing out that most Democrats nationally agree with him. “With respect to the minority leader, a recent Monmouth University poll found that nearly 70 percent of Democrats support Beto’s mandatory buyback of assault weapons,” O’Rourke’s fundraising email said. O'Rourke entered the Democratic race to great fanfare this year, but has struggled in the polls. Some Democrats have suggested he set his sights on a 2020 bid for the Senate, and not the White House. Even some liberal writers have acknowledged that O’Rourke’s gun policies could hurt him in Texas. “Beto is no longer a viable candidate for the Senate in Texas, thanks to his gun confiscation comment,” German Lopez, a writer for Vox,  wrote on Twitter . For his part, O’Rourke has been adamant that he no longer wants a Texas Senate seat, despite past pressure from some Texas Democrats and  news outlets  to drop his long-shot presidential bid and compete for Republican Sen. John Cornyn's seat instead. “There have even been some who have suggested that I stay in Texas and run for Senate,” O’Rourke said in an August speech. “But that would not be good enough for this community. That would not be good enough for El Paso. That would not be good enough for this country."" Cornyn joined the pile-on against O’Rourke’s shifting positions last week, highlighting another new O'Rourke proposal on marijuana. O’ROURKE CALLS FOR LEGALIZING MARIJUANA, RELEASING NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS “Say it ain’t so, Beto. First, grab guns of law abiding citizens and now legalize marijuana?” Cornyn tweeted. However, polling indicates that a slight majority of Texans in fact  support legalizing some quantity of marijuana . But O’Rourke would go further than legalization, proposing taxing marijuana to fund “justice grants” for people who were convicted for marijuana possession in the past. O’Rourke has also come out for impeaching President Trump. “Polls consistently show that an overwhelming majority of Texans do not support the impeachment of President Trump,” Fleming noted. A Quinnipiac  poll  found that 60 percent of Texans say Congress should not try to impeach, while only 34 percent support it. O’Rourke’s leftward shift has not been getting him traction in the polls yet. In polling averages, he gets just about 3 percent nationally. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “His far-left stance will continue to generate attention and secure him a spot on the cable news circuit. But it's not a governing philosophy, nor a winning campaign one,” Texas-based economist and political consultant Abby McCloskey told Fox News. “The far-left ground in the 2020 presidential campaign is better covered by [Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth] Warren, who clearly has thought through her proposals in detail,” McCloskey added. Fleming added: “His wild swing to gun confiscation appears to be an admission he won't ever run for office in Texas again.” Maxim Lott is executive producer of Stossel TV and creator of  ElectionBettingOdds.com .

"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden addresses whistleblower complaint, says if President Trump does not fully cooperate with a congressional investigation then Congress will have no choice but to initiate impeachment. Former Vice President Joe Biden  suggested on Tuesday that  President Trump  would only have himself to blame if he faces impeachment. ""Congress should demand the information it has the legal right to receive,"" Biden said Tuesday during a speech in Delaware. ""If the president does not comply with such a request of the Congress, if he continues to obstruct Congress and flout the law, Donald Trump will, in my view, leave Congress with no choice but to initiate impeachment. That would be a tragedy but a tragedy of his own making."" Trump, on Tuesday, announced that he would release the full transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is at the center of the latest controversy Democrats have cited in their push for impeachment. The administration reportedly suppressed a whistleblower seeking to report on Trump and Zelensky's phone call, which reportedly involved the president repeatedly urging his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden, the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Trump has denied any quid pro quo for foreign aid, but  Democrats  have portrayed the call as a second attempt for Trump to welcome outside interference in a presidential election. PELOSI EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP Biden called on Trump to release the full whistleblower report to Congress and comply with other congressional requests. The administration has stonewalled congressional investigations by refusing to comply with subpoenas surrounding the Russia investigation. While  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , has repeatedly resisted calls for impeachment, the Ukraine controversy appeared to change her mind. Fox News has confirmed that the speaker planned to announce a formal impeachment inquiry at 5 p.m. ET on Tuesday. Trump has used the whistleblower controversy to refocus attention on accusations surrounding Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings. Biden allegedly tried to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing a prosecutor who was probing a firm tied to his son. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in the call with Zelensky, insisting that he never engaged in any quid pro quo for foreign aid.

"In a letter to McConnell on Monday, Schumer writes that he is calling on the majority leader and Senate Republicans who control the chamber to ""take immediate action to stop President Trump from withholding an Intelligence Community whistleblower complaint that by law must be transmitted to Congress, and to begin an investigation into the Administration's handling of security assistance to Ukraine.""  Schumer calls for hearings ""to determine exactly what prompted the whistleblower to file this urgent complaint,"" and says they should feature testimony from a host of administration officials, including acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Schumer also calls for testimony from Trump's private attorney Rudy Giuliani.  Schumer also states that a subpoena should be issued ""to compel the delivery of the whistleblower complaint to Congress, as required by law.""  The letter is the latest effort by congressional Democratic leaders to push for an investigation into the whistleblower complaint amid a controversy surrounding Trump and his contact with Ukraine.  McConnell addressed the whistleblower complaint in remarks on the Senate floor on Monday afternoon and accused Schumer of politicizing the issue.  ""The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has long worked on a bipartisan basis in secure settings out of the public spotlight, to conduct critically important oversight of classified and sensitive matters,"" the Senate GOP leader said. ""So, I've been disappointed to see our colleague, the Democratic leader, choose to politicize the committee's ongoing efforts with respect to a recent whistleblower allegation, the specific subject of which is still unknown.""  McConnell went on to say that ""Chairman Burr and Vice chairman Warner have been working together to get the acting director of intelligence and the intelligence community's inspector general before the committee this week to discuss the matter,"" referring to Republican Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the committee. McConnell said that it is important that the work be handled ""in a secure setting"" and in a ""bipartisan fashion.""  Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden in a July call with Ukraine's president. CNN  has previously reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son Hunter. Schumer's letter calls on Senate Republicans to demand that the White House release the transcript of the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian President. It also asks that Trump administration officials be identified ""who directed that $341 million of security assistance to Ukraine be delayed.""  The letter from the Senate Democratic leader comes after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  called over the weekend  for the whistleblower to come before Congress.  Maguire is set to testify in open session before the House intelligence committee on Thursday.  In a letter to House Democrats, Pelosi wrote, ""At that time, we expect him to obey the law and turn over the whistleblower's full complaint to the Committee.  We also expect that he will establish a path for the whistleblower to speak directly to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as required by law."" Pelosi warned in the letter, however, that ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation."" More senators weigh in on whistleblower controversy Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told CNN on Monday that he hopes that he will have a chance to speak with the whistleblower, but would not weigh in on Trump's contacts with the Ukrainian President. ""I would like the whistleblower to come and talk to me so I know what his story is,"" Grassley said when asked if the complaint should be turned over to Congress. ""I don't want to hear it second hand."" When asked if it is an appropriate use of Trump's office to talk to Ukraine's president about the Bidens, the GOP senator sidestepped the question, saying, ""I think through the news media maybe you can get the whistleblower to come and talk to us.""  Warner would not say if he believes that it's an impeachable offense if Trump urged Ukraine to probe Biden in exchange for releasing military aid.  ""What I want to do is get the truth first,"" Warner said, adding that he wants a probe done in a bipartisan way. ""We need to get the facts.""  This story has been updated with additional developments Monday."
"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders sits down with Bret Baier following the debate. For the third straight time, the  Democratic  presidential debate in Houston led with a discussion of health care. As Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., put it: ""Every one of my colleagues on this stage believes in universal health care."" Booker’s statement prompts this question: Why should government get involved in health care for Americans who do not require government assistance? Most Americans believe the  government  should provide a ""safety net"" for the poor. It does this with assistance such as food stamps. However, you do not hear anyone calling for an expansion of food stamps to cover all Americans regardless of whether they are rich or poor. So why is that the case with health care? HOW MUCH WOULD 'MEDICARE FOR ALL' COST? DEMOCRATS' HEALTH CARE PLAN EXPLAINED The federal government, through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – more commonly known as food stamps – provides  assistance  to low-income people. The government does not make the food or control the price of food. It does not dictate what foods people should buy. And the government provides absolutely no food assistance to the majority of American households. This is a ""safety net."" It is designed to make sure the poorest among us have food on their table. There seems to be broad agreement that food stamps are a good way to address the nutritional needs of our poor. In health care, we have something similar. It is called Medicaid. It provides funding for medical services for low-income and disabled people. We also have Medicare, which provides health insurance coverage for older Americans. So the government already has programs in place to take care of the health of our poor and elderly. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Until President Obama came along, there seemed to be rough consensus that this was the right way to ensure America took care of its poor and elderly. Most Americans were, presumably, in a position to take care of their own health care. Most accomplished this by working in job that provided health benefits, buying their own insurance, or relying on a parent or spouse's health insurance plan. Others chose not to buy insurance and to pay for care as they received it. Obama and his fellow Democrats insisted that every American have government health care or private insurance, and thus devised ObamaCare, which expanded Medicaid to cover more Americans. In order to cover everyone else, for the first time in our nation’s history the federal government made it illegal not to purchase a particular product: in this case, health insurance. Yes, even if you paid tens of thousands of dollars for your child to become a doctor who could take care of you for free, you still were legally obligated to buy health insurance. Now health care is again front and center for Democrats. They say ObamaCare is not enough. They insist America must provide free health care for every single American, old and young, rich and poor. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., criticized former Vice President Joe Biden’s plan in the last debate because it only covered 97 percent of Americans! For his part, Biden proudly announced that under his plan the government will tell drug companies what they can charge for drugs. With government now involved in everyone’s health care, we are seeing the adverse effects. Everyone is now on government health care or mandatory insurance, and insurance premiums cost the same regardless of a person’s heath, destroying much of the free market in health care. Where are the menus of services with prices at the doctor’s office? They are not there because people do not care what the cost is because they don’t pay it! The government and insurance companies are in the middle, determining what and how much to pay, but never sure about what services the doctor or hospital actually provided. Fraud, therefore, runs rampant. Patients have no incentive to shop for better pricing, and doctors have no incentive to provide it. Patients similarly have no financial incentive to avoid doctor visits by maintaining a proper diet and exercise. As a result, we have runaway increases in the costs of health care. The Democratic solution? For Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others on the stage, it is to put the final bullet in what is left of the free market in health care. Progressivism has taken over the Democratic Party. It no longer believes in free markets. History shows that if government would get out of the way and allow the free market to do its thing, there is no telling what solutions would emerge for health care. New technologies utilizing the Internet, cell phones, Skype, and artificial intelligence would be fully exploited. Competition would bring down prices, as we have seen in areas of medical care not covered by the government or insurance companies. Sanders complains that America is ""the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people."" America also is the richest country on Earth. Has he ever considered that the two may be related? It is precisely because America does not hand over control of large sectors of its economy to the government that we have had such economic success. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Why is a safety net insufficient for Democrats? Is it about control? Is it about destroying free-market capitalism wherever they can? Is it in pursuit of a liberal utopia where everyone is treated the same? We do not know. The question was never asked.

"During Friday's taping of “The View”, the co-hosts were previewing next week's Democratic debates. When the topic turned to some of the candidates outside of the frontrunners tier, Megan McCain took some digs at the longshots. ""The View""  co-host  Meghan McCain  clashed not only with her co-hosts but with the audience as well during Tuesday's show. The hosts were discussing the latest controversy fueling  Democratic calls  for impeachment, something McCain suggested was an unwise move that she was sick of hearing about. ""Quite frankly, I’m sick of hearing everybody b---h about it. Just do it,"" she said. She noted that in doing so, Democrats would be flouting political concerns from  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , and ignoring the history surrounding former President Bill Clinton's impeachment. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CLAIMS UKRAINE AID WAS STALLED OVER CORRUPTION CONCERNS, DECRIES MEDIA 'FRENZY' After noting that co-host Sunny Hostin had long supported impeachment, Hostin cheered the word. When the audience applauded in response, McCain told them to let her finish her comments. ""Let me finish, thank you,"" she said. Co-host Joy Behar argued that Democrats would ""get it together"" before the election — ""Don't worry about the Democrats,"" she said. McCain appeared to mock that by saying she wanted the show to display a clip of Behar's comments on election night. Someone in the audience apparently booed, prompting McCain to respond: ""Oh, come on."" Their comments came as Pelosi faced heightened pressure to impeach the president following a report that he told the Ukrainian president to look into corruption allegations surrounding the Biden family. Co-host Abby Huntsman, who previously cautioned against jumping to conclusions on the issue, said on Tuesday that the issue concerned her a lot. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""In my opinion, this is extortion,"" she said, referring to speculation that Trump tacitly withheld aid to pressure Ukraine into investigating  former Vice President Joe Biden.  Trump has denied any quid pro quo and claimed that he resisted giving aid to Ukraine because he wanted other countries to contribute."
"Democratic lawmakers and the White House are at odds over a whistleblower complaint of an alleged promise by President Trump to a foreign leader; chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge reports from Washington. As  President Trump  faces media scrutiny over a phone call he held with  Ukraine  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Rep.  Adam Schiff , D-Calif., said he may seek to withhold funds from the  intelligence community  unless they disclose the full contents of the conversation. Schiff, who serves as the House Intel Committee chairman, appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, where host Jake Tapper asked if Schiff would be willing to put the nation at risk to get to the bottom of the cryptic report. ""It depends on what funds we withhold,"" Schiff replied. ""In this case, you have the office of the director of national intelligence that is withholding this complaint in violation of the clear letter of the law... And there are funding requests that that office makes that don’t go directly to national security that we can withhold."" The story was  first reported  by the Washington Post as a whistleblower claim about Trump making some type of ""promise"" to a foreign leader, which may have been of a nefarious nature.  Further reporting  claimed the conversation was linked to Ukraine, and Trump's request for their government to look into  2020 presidential  hopeful  Joe Biden 's son and his business dealings. GREGG JARRETT: THE TRUMP WHISTLEBLOWER MAY NOT BE A WHISTLEBLOWER AT ALL ""Look, it is a blunt remedy and one that I’m very reluctant to use,"" Schiff continued. ""At the same time, the inspector general has said this is not only serious...but it's urgent. We cannot afford to play rope-a-dope in the court for weeks or months on end. We need an answer."" Schiff also reignited the impeachment debate which seemed to be fading away, after several failed attempts by House lawmakers to oust the president from office. ""If there is a fire burning, it needs to be put out. And that's why we’re going to have to look at every remedy. And if these two issues are, in fact, one issue and it relates to deplorable conduct, a violation of the president’s oath of office... then we're going to have to consider impeachment as well,"" he said. Trump responded to the story on Twitter Thursday and again on Saturday, saying the narrative was ""fake news"" conjured up by biased members of the media. TRUMP: CONVERSATION WITH UKRANIAN PRESIDENT 'WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT,' TOUCHED ON CORRUPTION, OTHER ISSUES CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone 'bust' on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden. Will fail again!"" he wrote on Saturday. Trump also responded to the story while speaking to reporters outside the  White House  Sunday morning, and claimed he did nothing wrong. “I said absolutely nothing wrong; it was perfect,” Trump said. “There was no quid pro quo, there was nothing,” he later added."
"In public, for the last five days,  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  and his campaign have been on a ferocious offensive, ripping into President Trump for allegedly abusing his powers in asking Ukraine’s leader to help hurt  Mr. Biden  politically, and castigating the news media for questioning his son Hunter Biden’s financial dealings there. On Tuesday, Mr. Biden made his biggest move yet, saying Congress should start an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump if he does not cooperate with their investigations. In private, though, this has been an enraging and uncertain time for the Biden campaign, and for Mr. Biden himself, who associates say has been astounded both by Mr. Trump’s contact with the Ukrainian government and his obvious enthusiasm for attacking Mr. Biden’s family. He and his advisers have long feared that  Hunter Biden  would become a target for political opponents, according to people familiar with their thinking, and now the scrutiny of Mr. Biden’s son is bound to intensify. And as Mr. Trump’s onslaught has pushed the House of Representatives to start  an impeachment inquiry , Mr. Biden now faces a crucial political test where his standing may hinge on how he handles a wildly unpredictable confrontation with Mr. Trump. Bryce Smith, the Democratic Party chairman in Dallas County, Iowa, said the moment showcased Mr. Biden as a candidate Mr. Trump is “genuinely worried about” and offered a reminder of the lengths Mr. Trump may go to oppose any Democratic opponent. But it also exposed Mr. Biden to risks in the leadoff caucus state, he said. “I could see people who are already on the fence about him, maybe because of his long career in politics, his age, his ability to win this, kind of going, ‘Oh, great, we’re already starting this and he hasn’t even gotten the nomination,’” Mr. Smith said. “And others going, ‘He’s obviously being thought of as a formidable opponent, if Trump is thinking about it like this.’” Mr. Biden and his campaign team have encouraged the latter interpretation, trying to project an image of strength in the primary and warning the press that the Biden campaign would deliver blunt criticism about coverage it sees as unfair. At a Philadelphia fund-raising event on Monday, Mr. Biden pledged, “I’m not going to take a punch and not punch back.” Yet allies of Mr. Biden acknowledge privately that the campaign has been girding for months for criticism of Hunter Biden, who has charted a winding career as a bank executive, lobbyist and financier, often operating in parts of the private sector that overlapped with his father’s footprint in government. They have declined to say whether they vetted Hunter Biden’s business activities as part of preparing for the 2020 presidential campaign, arguing that the political world should be solely focused on Mr. Trump’s conduct. Image President Trump in New York on Tuesday. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times There is no evidence that Mr. Biden, as vice president, intentionally tried to help his son in his dealings with Ukraine, but Hunter Biden’s business career has sporadically drawn attention from political rivals and the media for more than a decade. Associates say Mr. Biden is infuriated by Mr. Trump’s conduct and astonished by the president’s willingness to dismiss some of the most basic ethical lines in American politics.    In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president’s actions an “abuse of power’’ that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations.  In some respects, Mr. Trump’s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden’s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share. At fund-raisers and other events, Democrats who have spoken with Mr. Biden in recent days say he has largely appeared measured, greeting old friends in his typical effusive style and keeping the focus on his concerns with Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, rather than dwelling on the challenges the moment raises for his family. Still unclear in this moment of crisis is what conclusions Democratic voters might make about Mr. Biden as an opponent for Mr. Trump, and how a drive for impeachment in Congress might shape the Democratic primary campaign. Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, who saw Mr. Biden at a fund-raiser in Iowa on Saturday, said he believed that Mr. Trump’s dangerous conduct was at the forefront of Mr. Biden’s mind. “I suspect he’s just as focused and just as concerned about that as he is about an attack on a family member, as personal as that is,” said Mr. Vilsack, who served as agriculture secretary in the Obama administration. A memo circulated to political surrogates from the Biden campaign on Tuesday urged supporters to note that “this isn’t about Biden or his family. We all know who Trump is,” and also suggested criticizing reporters for giving undeserved coverage to Mr. Trump’s attacks on Mr. Biden and his son. “Trump is successfully playing the same game he played in 2016 — and the press is falling for it again,” the memo stated. This clash has come at a precarious moment for Mr. Biden’s candidacy, as he seeks to recover momentum after a largely limp summer on the campaign trail. He has slipped in the polls over the last two months and faces an increasingly formidable challenge from Senator Elizabeth Warren: Two polls released in recent days showed her slightly overtaking him in  Iowa  and  New Hampshire , the leadoff states in the Democratic nomination process. In the short term, at least, Mr. Trump may have effectively put Hunter Biden off limits for his father’s Democratic rivals. It is unlikely that any other candidate in Mr. Biden’s party would soon follow Mr. Trump in going after the former vice president’s son on the subject of business ethics, while Mr. Trump may face an impeachment inquiry for allegedly pressuring a foreign government to do just that. Senator Bernie Sanders, for one, deflected a reporter’s question on Tuesday about whether he thought the sudden focus on Hunter Biden’s overseas work would weaken the Biden campaign. “You guys write very perceptive articles on these things, and I’ll let you make that judgment,” he replied. It is unclear, however, how well prepared Mr. Biden and his campaign may be to address questions about Hunter Biden’s business dealings beyond the specific case Mr. Trump has attempted to raise. Hunter Biden has operated for years in parts of the business world that intersected with his father’s career in government, including working for MBNA, a Delaware-based bank, while his father was involved in rewriting the bankruptcy code as a senator, and leading an investment fund that did business in foreign countries   while his father was vice president. Hunter Biden’s work for MBNA briefly became an issue during his father’s campaign for the vice presidency in 2008, and Obama-Biden campaign officials  defended it  as within the bounds of ethical propriety. TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, said the former vice president was indeed angry that Mr. Trump was “lying about his family, and now appears to be blackmailing a foreign government into helping legitimize those lies.”  “He’s fighting back, which is what Democrats want to see in their nominee and why he will beat Donald Trump next fall,” Mr. Ducklo said, adding, “The V.P. and his family know Donald Trump plays dirty, and they can take it.” Mr. Ducklo declined to say whether the campaign had vetted Hunter Biden’s business dealings and said the media should not be asking questions like that. “We’re not going to indulge Trump’s conspiracy theories, and we’re not going to dignify his attacks with a response,” he said. Mr. Biden is said to have limited patience for discussing Hunter Biden’s apparent political vulnerabilities, even in private. Some of Mr. Biden’s close advisers have argued in private settings that going after any member of Mr. Biden’s family — including Hunter Biden — would ultimately backfire on an opponent, because of Mr. Biden’s stature and the sympathetic feelings much of the public has for him and his family. For Mr. Biden, the matter of his son is deeply sensitive for reasons that have nothing to do with politics: While the whole Biden family endorsed his choice to enter the 2020 race, friends of Mr. Biden said consistently throughout his deliberations that his deepest anxiety was the impact of a campaign on a family still grappling with profound loss after the death of Mr. Biden’s elder son, Beau Biden, in 2015, from brain cancer. “I know that he worked through that, he did a lot of contemplation about how it would affect the family,” said the Rev. Joseph Darby, an influential South Carolina-based pastor who has known Mr. Biden for years. Earlier this year, Hunter Biden  spoke in detail  to The New Yorker magazine about the crippling grief he experienced after his brother’s death, and his long-running struggles with drug addiction. The magazine story also detailed a number of potential ethical conflicts in Hunter Biden’s business activities and described the vice president as having dealt “with Hunter’s activities by largely ignoring them.”  Maggie Astor and Sydney Ember contributed reporting.

"""Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion,"" Biden said Friday. ""Not one single one, and so I have no comment except the President should start to be president."" Biden said no more about the issue as he and his staff loaded into a van to depart the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, after hosting a town hall on Friday afternoon.  His remarks came as a communication between Trump and a foreign leader prompted  a whistleblower complaint that is now at the center of a dispute  between the director of national intelligence and Congress. The whistleblower's complaint deals at least in part with Ukraine, The New York Times and Washington Post reported Thursday night, prompting speculation that it could be tied to reports that the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, had asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.  Trump pressed Ukraine's President to investigate Hunter Biden during a call earlier this summer, a person familiar with the situation said Friday. In 2014, while Biden was vice president under President Barack Obama, Hunter Biden joined the board of a natural gas company called Burisma owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. In 2016, while Burisma was being investigated, Western governments, including the Obama administration, called for the removal of Ukraine's top prosecutor due to concerns about corruption in his office. Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor wasn't let go. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  On Thursday, Giuliani denied asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden but moments later said he had done just that. Giuliani's comments came in a heated exchange on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" as Chris Cuomo pressed the former New York mayor over conversations he'd had with a Ukrainian official about Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of the prosecutor -- who had investigated Burisma. Earlier Friday,  Trump continued to blast news of the whistleblower complaint  in the Oval Office, calling it ""a ridiculous story."" ""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" he said, adding, ""It's just another political hack job.""  Trump said he doesn't know the identity of the person who made the complaint. Later Friday, Biden released a statement about the whistleblower complaint, saying: ""If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump's willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. ... At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress."" UPDATE: This story has been updated with additional context about the lack of evidence to support the allegations against the Bidens. "
"Image Bernie Sanders greeting supporters after a campaign event in Reno, Nev., this month. Credit Max Whittaker for The New York Times Bernie Sanders has gone much further than  any of the other 2020 Democratic presidential candidates  in proposing not just more money for affordable housing, or more enforcement of fair-housing laws, but also fundamental changes  in how the housing market functions .  His most startling ideas — a national rent control standard, and new taxes on land speculation and house  “flipping”  — would bring America closer to the idea that housing should be treated as shelter and not a commodity. But in the  housing plan his campaign released Wednesday , Mr. Sanders doesn’t go all the way there. He allows for profit, but not certain kinds of profit, or profit by certain kinds of actors. In that middle ground, somewhere between the private market and social housing for all, things get complicated. The national rent control standard Mr. Sanders has proposed would cap the amount that landlords can raise rents, to shield tenants from escalating housing costs and, in a deeper sense, the excesses of capitalism in the housing market. Landlords could raise the rent by no more than 3 percent per year,  or  one and a half times the rate of inflation, whichever is higher.  His housing plan says nothing about the profits of people buying and selling homes in the normal course of homeownership. In fact, Mr. Sanders would invest an additional $8 billion into federal programs to help first-time home buyers, precisely because homeownership in America is often a means of building wealth. Between the two proposals lies a fraught balance: One would curb profits in the housing market, while the other acknowledges that many Americans depend on those profits. Mr. Sanders’s campaign seeks to reconcile the two by arguing that rich investors or landlords shouldn’t get to make so much, while ordinary American families should have a chance to make something.  “We want to return to the notion that homeownership can be an asset builder for working people and average American families, and it is not just a vehicle to commodify to make the rich richer,” said Josh Orton, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign and its national policy director. In practice, however, it’s not always obvious how to distinguish the working families from the rich investors, or how to devise policies that crack down on the one but not the other. Some middle-class families, for example, build wealth by owning rental properties. And landlord groups are skeptical that 3 percent rent increases would build them much wealth, especially when property taxes, insurance rates and utilities aren’t also capped.  Mr. Sanders’s proposal would also put a hefty tax on house flipping, hitting owners who sell a property for more than the original price within five years of purchase (for a place they don’t occupy). But that definition would cover people we don’t think of as flippers: a small-scale general contractor who remodels two homes a year; a family that buys a home for an aging parent who later dies; a landlord who herself faces financial distress and must get out of the business. Mr. Sanders has similarly proposed a tax on empty homes, aimed at speculators who sit on vacant properties until they become more lucrative to redevelop, or simply profitable to resell. That is a real problem in some communities, leaving neighbors to live with blight for years. But owning an empty home doesn’t necessarily make you a speculator. Someone who has put a property on the market and struggled to sell it for months might end up facing this tax.  The full proposal, emphasizing the feel-good parts of the market but not the others, is trying to have it both ways, said Jenny Schuetz, a housing economist at the Brookings Institution who has been  following housing proposals from the 2020 candidates .  “In some ideal universe, people would buy homes (or rental properties) that appreciated slightly faster than inflation, allowing them to build wealth, but without housing costs rising too fast to pressure renters, deter new homeowners, or create excess capital gains,” Ms. Schuetz wrote in an email. “In that context, both rent control and flipping taxes make sense. The problem is, with any semblance of a private real estate market, land and housing values don’t behave that way.” She is skeptical that it is even possible to design or regulate a market that gives modest returns to individual homeowners, but never gives big returns to landlords; that penalizes greedy flippers, but never harms small-time contractors; that taxes vacant homes but doesn’t punish working families. Mr. Sanders’s ideas invite a host of questions about how they would technically work (how do we police a million landlords?) and where their legal authority would come from (would the courts uphold a national rent control law?). But these deeper questions about the kind of housing market voters might want seem worth hashing out, regardless of those other details. Mr. Orton, the Sanders adviser, pushed back against the logic of  economists  that, for one, rent control discourages developers from building and landlords from renting housing that Americans badly need. “I would say to those economists, how is that working out?” he said of the current deference to the market. “That’s what we’ve been doing. When we’ve left this to private developers, everything from the crash of the housing market to how we’ve seen gentrification just explode in some of the most vulnerable communities, to how we’ve seen people priced out of what would normally be affordable housing — this current crisis is the result of that.”"
"But the Kentucky Republican and his fellow GOP senators did not explicitly commit to pushing for the full complaint turned over to the committee. McConnell's pledge came the same day Trump announced he would release an ""unredacted transcript"" of the call Trump made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during which Trump encouraged the Ukrainians to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.  It also came on the same day House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi announced  a formal impeachment inquiry to investigate the allegations. On Monday McConnell  blasted Democrats  for what he said was a politicization of the issue before the facts were known. The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to meet in a classified setting Thursday with the Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and the Inspector General for the Intelligence Community Michael Atkinson where they will be asked to testify about what they know about the whistleblower complaint.  McConnell said the Intelligence Committee, which is chaired by Sen. Richard Burr, a Republican of North Carolina, would look into the issue.    ""We're going to find out what happened. In the Senate, through a process pre-established through the Intelligence Committee behind closed doors initially with the acting director of DNI,"" McConnell said. ""I think that is the responsible, rather apolitical, at least bipartisan way to proceed with what we think we know at this particular point."" Burr was tight-lipped Monday about how his committee would respond to the complaint, although finally said he want to ""bring the interested parties in"" before the committee.  The top Democrat on the committee is Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.  ""This is one step in a process. This is an orderly process, where the Committee, the full Committee, will get a chance to hear from both the IC Inspector General,  Mr. (Michael) Atkinson , and the Acting DNI, Admiral Maguire,"" Warner said.  ""But again, we're going to take this one step at a time, and I think it's terribly important to get the facts."" A Senate Democrat source told CNN that Democrats are trying to remain focused on obtaining the whistleblower complaint itself despite Trump's announcement Tuesday he will release the transcript from his call with Zelensky. The thinking is, per this source, that the concerns about Trump's conduct do not hinge completely on what is in the transcript. Multiple sources have also noted that the Democrats maintain the acting DNI is required to provide the complaint to Congress by law. The second-ranking Republican, Sen. John Thune, did not say if Republicans will insist the administration turn over the whistleblower's formal complaint. ""We'll know a lot more when the Intel Committee meets with them this week,"" Thune said. ""If it's an intelligence related issue then it probably falls under the committee's jurisdiction and I'm sure they will be anxious to get all those answers."" Also Tuesday, the Senate adopted by unanimous consent a resolution authored by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urging the administration to provide the full compliant to Congress. Schumer, D-New York, said the resolution was ""aimed at a recalcitrant executive branch, which has blocked the ability for the committees to see the complaint, even though the law requires it."" McConnell said Republicans would go along with the resolution in the spirit that it would assist the Intelligence Committee conduct its investigation. "
"In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour outside of the United Nations, Gore said ""there is no evidence ... of any credible accusation against (Biden).""  ""The facts being laid out on President Trump's conversation with the head of Ukraine must be investigated thoroughly,"" he continued. ""And this latest accusation, like some of the others, falls into a rare category. The only remedy is an impeachment investigation."" The controversy surrounding a phone call  Trump acknowledged  having with Ukraine's president about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden in July has rekindled talk among Democrats about a potential impeachment movement.  CNN previously reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to  investigate Biden's son , according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of  a whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.  There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. When asked if he thought an impeachment investigation against Trump should happen, Gore said the latest controversy gives ""new impetus"" to congressional Democrats' first stage in investigating whether there should be impeachment proceedings. ""There's a difference between an investigation to see if there should be a formal impeachment and the formal impeachment itself. They're in the first stage now. But this really gives new impetus to that,"" he said.  Gore continued: ""It all depends on what the truth is, but they must find the truth. Because, were it to be true, and not addressed, it would normalize the most obscene and outrageous behavior, threaten the rule of law and the promise of democracy and self-governance. That much is at stake."" House Democrats have said they are a close to a  ""tipping point""  on an impeachment investigation into Trump. In a  letter to Congress  on Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for the Trump administration to allow the whistleblower who made the complaint to the Intelligence Community's Inspector General to come before Congress. ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi wrote."
"""Everybody does it,"" Trump said Monday. That blasé attitude is not reflected in Congress, where the weekend's revelations have led more Democrats to support an impeachment inquiry against Trump. The worst possible scenario, which not everybody believes, is that Trump used his office and his authority over foreign aid to stir up trouble for a leading 2020 rival.  But the political fight is over more than just whether Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, to get involved in the US presidential election by investigating Biden and his son, Hunter, over Hunter's former business interests. It's also about what must be shared with Congress after a whistleblower raised the alarm, and just how much Trump has changed what's allowed in American politics. ""I'm leading in the polls, they have no idea how they stop me,"" Trump told reporters Tuesday at the United Nations. ""The only way they can try is through impeachment."" This is a fast moving scandal that's hard to keep track of. Here's what we know about each of the issues at hand: Did Trump talk to Ukraine's new president about Joe Biden? Yes.  Trump initially denied it, but over the weekend admitted  that when he talked to Zelensky on July 25, he brought up Joe Biden. Trump also made clear that in his mind, Biden = corruption.  On Sunday, Trump said of the conversation: ""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption),"" Trump told reporters. The call is part of the whistleblower complaint against Trump. The Wall Street Journal  reported  Friday that Trump told Zelensky ""that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know"" whether allegations were true or not, a person familiar with the matter said, according to the Journal. While Trump pressed Zelensky, he did not bring up military aid on the call, CNN reported Friday. Mr. Giuliani is former New York mayor and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who has been calling for months for a new inquiry into Biden's role in a corruption purge in Ukraine during the Obama administration. He renewed those calls during a remarkable  interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo last Thursday during which he said he asked officials in Ukraine to investigate Biden. Why is anyone suggesting Trump pressured Zelensky or tied a Biden investigation to military aid? At the same time Trump was mentioning Biden to Zelensky, Giuliani was actively pushing Ukraine's top prosecutor, who has since left that position, to officially investigate Biden and his son. That's also about the same time Trump's administration was putting the skids on nearly $400 million aid, including $250 million in military aid and $141 million from the State Department, US officials familiar with the matter tell CNN. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said on Twitter last week that after he met recently with Zelensky, there was no question the Ukrainian was concerned both about the aid being cut off and about Giuliani's calls for an investigation in Biden. ""Zelensky did not explicitly connect the two in our meeting, but he was VERY concerned about the cut off of aid, and VERY aware of the conversations that Rudy Giuliani was having with his team. I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump's campaign operatives. He agreed,"" Murphy explained in a series of tweets. An aide to Zelensky, Andriy Yermak, summed up his contacts with Giuliani in an interview published Monday. ""So, Giuliani and I talked on the phone, and after that we personally met in Madrid. I repeated to him the same points. He noted that it was important for him to hear that the new Ukrainian government would preach the principles of openness and legality, will fight corruption, and set as its goal to make Ukraine successful."" Who is Zelensky? Zelensky is a former comedian, and like Trump, a newcomer to politics. Before his election in April, he was better known as the star of a TV show in which he  played the President of Ukraine . When he won a landslide victory over Petro Poroshenko, he promised to clean up corruption. Did Zelensky feel pressured by Trump to investigate Biden? There are conflicting accounts on this. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said over the weekend that his country would not take sides in a US election. ""I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,"" he told the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske,  according to Reuters . ""This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers."" Did Trump directly tie military aid to Ukraine to investigating Biden? We don't entirely know. It does not appear Trump ever explicitly told Zelensky that if he didn't investigate Biden, he wouldn't get the military aid. There is a transcript of the call, but it's not clear if or when anyone outside the White House will see it. Some details of the call have been reported,  including by CNN . ""I did not make a statement that 'you have to do this or I'm not going to give you aid.' I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that,"" Trump told reporters on Monday.  He also suggested it's his hope the call's transcript is released: ""It was a very nice call. I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon."" When was the military aid to Ukraine frozen? CNN confirmed that Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on the millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before a call with Zelensky, two senior administration officials said on Monday. Officials from the Office of Management and Budget told officials from the Pentagon and State Department about the freeze at a meeting in mid-July, according to  The Washington Post . When and how were the funds frozen? Trump admitted he withheld the money in comments to reporters at the UN Tuesday. He said he wanted Europe to do more for Ukraine. But then he added the money was ultimately paid. He didn't point out it was ultimately paid because of an objection from Democrats. ""My complaint has always been -- and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,"" he said. Because they not doing it, it's the United States. We're putting up the bulk of the money. Mulvaney has long been skeptical of the aid. Former national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not agree on much, but they did agree that Ukraine should get the aid. Congressional staffers say Congress was in the dark on the holdup. ""The administration did not notify us that the aid was frozen,"" according to a Senate aide. ""The House Appropriations Committee learned of it on or about August 23rd and informed us, and then the first news stories appeared days later. In response to our inquiries, DoD confirmed to us that the funds were frozen on August 28th."" Further, according to CNN reporting, officials in Ukraine were never formally told the funds were being frozen. Why does Trump keep returning to Biden and Ukraine?  Politics. Trump wants to attack Biden's credibility. Every time Trump is asked about his conversation with Zelensky, he returns to his message about Biden, as he did on Twitter Monday. ""Now the Fake News Media says I 'pressured the Ukrainian President at least 8 times during my telephone call with him.' This supposedly comes from a so-called 'whistleblower' who they say doesn't even have a first hand account of what was said. More Democrat/Crooked Media con.......Breaking News: The Ukrainian Government just said they weren't pressured at all during the 'nice' call. Sleepy Joe Biden, on the other hand, forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine. That's the real story!"" An important note: There have been no serious allegations of specific wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. An investigation into a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board, had been shelved by a prosecutor before Biden and many other Western officials and Ukrainians called for him to step down.  Biden had threatened aid in the form of loan guarantees  if the prosecutor did not leave office. When did Trump's focus on Biden and Ukraine start? This is a story that has been percolating for some time. Giuliani has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden's call in 2016 to remove the country's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating the natural gas company connected to Hunter Biden. CNN reported in August that Giuliani and Yermak, the aide to Zelensky, had spoken several times over the phone and met in Madrid. Now according to The Washington Post, Giuliani said he has had five conversations with Yermak. Separately, Giuliani told the Post he did not address the issue of US aid to Ukraine in the Madrid person to person meeting this summer. ""I was not involved in the aid at all,"" he said,  referring to military aid . ""I had no idea the $250 million was on the table."" He said that Yermak was pushing for an Oval Office meeting between Trump and the Ukrainian president and that the Ukrainians were ""embarrassed"" there had not been one yet.  Giuliani has said he essentially stumbled upon the Biden element. He had been pushing in Ukraine on an effort to clear Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who is currently in jail for tax evasion on money he made for political consulting in Ukraine and elsewhere. Why does Ukraine need US military aid? Ukraine is dealing with Russian-backed separatists in the Eastern part of the country and still opposes Russia's 2014 takeover of Crimea, which had been part of Ukraine. The country is very much standing between Vladimir Putin's Russia and the West. What is the aid used for? The assistance,  according to previous CNN reports , is for sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, counter-artillery radars, night vision and military medical treatment -- all of which Ukrainians could use to counter pro-Russian separatists. What was the official reason that aid to Ukraine was frozen? The White House has said it wanted to make sure the new administration in Ukraine would stay true to its word and cut down on corruption. Vice President Mike Pence, for instance, denied earlier this month that the holdup had anything to do with Biden, but he did say, ""We have great concerns about issues of corruption... I mean, to invest additional taxpayer in Ukraine, the President wants to be assured that those resources are truly making their way to the kind of investments that will contribute to security and stability in Ukraine."" That's very similar to language Trump used Sunday, except Trump tied the idea of corruption in Ukraine to Biden, perhaps further suggesting a link between the money and the investigation. Trump returned to corruption during his comments to reporters at the United Nations on Monday. ""If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?"" he said. ""One of the reasons the new president got elected is he was going to stop corruption. It's very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption. Very important."" How was the aid unfrozen? There was bipartisan opposition to the freeze up on Capitol Hill. CNN reported on September 12 that the administration had suddenly dropped its opposition to the aid after Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, got bipartisan support for an amendment to force the administration's hand. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and Trump ally who nevertheless supported the aid to Ukraine, gave Durbin credit for making the aid happen. ""So why was it released? Because of your amendment, that's why it was released,"" Graham said during an appropriations hearing earlier in September. ""Because I was going to vote for it, so I think they got the message. If you're listening in the Ukraine on C-SPAN, you're going to get the money."" Has Ukraine gotten any of the aid? ""The Department of Defense was able to begin obligating these funds last week. We will continue to leverage all available tools to expedite the implementation of these programs. We expect the majority of the funds to be obligated by the end of the fiscal year,"" according to Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman. Some $60 million had been obligated fairly quickly (as of last Monday), according to a US official. The Pentagon is confident that it can obligate $220 million before the end of the fiscal year and is working with Congress to get an extension to continue the aid delivery. The House voted last week to extend the window for the aid through November. Why is it important when Trump talked to Zelensky?  It's completely incredible that Trump may have pressured the Ukrainian president, essentially asking him to investigate a US political rival, in the very midst of denying his campaign colluded with Russia's election interference in 2016.  On Wednesday, July 24, former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about all of the Trump campaign interactions with Russia in 2016 and explained why his report did not recommend charges against the President or his aides for seeking political help from a foreign government. ""NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION!"" Trump tweeted that day and his allies hailed the end of calls for impeachment. Turns out things were just beginning. He talked to Zelensky the next day. What is the fight over the whistleblower? While there had been plenty of reporting on Biden's involvement in the Ukraine, on Giuliani's quest to highlight it for campaign season and on the temporary halt of aid to Ukraine, the whistleblower complaint is what tied them all together. But the White House tried very hard to keep it quiet. While Congress should be entitled under the law to hear about whistleblower complaints, the White House had justified keeping it from Congress. The Intelligence Community Inspector General informed lawmakers that the complaint existed, but no one outside the intelligence community or the White House has actually seen it. That's because the DNI has, on the advice of the White House and Department of Justice, resisted providing the report to Congress and have said it is not actually covered by the whistleblower law. What are Democrats saying? Even some Democrats who had opposed impeachment proceedings against Trump are now saying there is no alternative. ""I don't think we have a choice under the Constitution,"" said Texas Rep. Vicente Gonzalez on CNN Monday. ""We must move forward with impeachment proceedings.""  ""I don't think we'll have much of a choice,"" he said. ""It seems like the President is really pushing us for impeachment proceedings. I don't know if he's baiting us because he has a personal agenda that he thinks this might be helpful to him."" What is Trump saying now? He was asked exactly during an appearance Monday at the United Nations if he's taking impeachment seriously. ""Not at all seriously,"" Trump said, denying any wrongdoing and staying impeccably on-message that this whole thing has more to do with Biden.  ""We had a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""Everybody knows it's just a Democrat witch hunt. Here we go again. They failed with Russia, they failed with recession and now they're bringing this up. The one who has the problem is Biden. Biden did what they would like to have me do except one problem, I didn't do it.""  This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday."
"WEBSTER CITY, Iowa — Iowa’s presidential caucuses disenfranchise huge blocs of voters. The state is 91 percent white. It is not easy to get to, or get around in. But to a greater degree than in recent campaigns, this unrepresentative and idiosyncratic state is proving that it is the only electoral battleground that matters for Democrats from now until caucus night on Feb. 3.  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign said it would have 110 staff members in the state by the end of this month. Senator Kamala Harris has promised to visit every week in October. Mayor Pete Buttigieg on Sunday kicked off a John McCain-like, everything-on-the-record bus tour and is advertising on local television and radio. Senator Amy Klobuchar is 49 counties into her tour of all 99 in the state. And on Monday, Senator Bernie Sanders will begin a “Bernie Beats Trump’’ tour of eastern Iowa to highlight what he says is his strength as a general election candidate. As  a new poll suggested a significant shift  in the primary race’s top tier — with Senator Elizabeth Warren overtaking Mr. Biden for first place — candidates at the annual Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines on Saturday tried to cut through  the furor surrounding President Trump, Ukraine and Mr. Biden  to deliver their message to voters still sifting through their preferences from one of the largest fields in history. The candidates’ renewed sense of  urgency  has set the stage for a four-month sprint to a night of caucuses that remains the single biggest prize in American politics. “We know that Iowa is where we can turn heads,’’ Mr. Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., said aboard his campaign bus on Sunday. “Even the other early states will be looking at what Iowa did.” The increasing focus on Iowa, where voters must attend an hourslong midwinter evening gathering to participate in choosing their party’s nominee, has come at the expense of New Hampshire, where the nation’s first primary election comes eight days later.  None of the Democratic presidential candidates are betting their entire campaigns on a strong performance in New Hampshire, meaning it may be the first time since 1984 that there is not a candidate focused solely on the Granite State in a contested presidential race. With so many candidates running, much remains unsettled. And both Iowa and New Hampshire have a history of lifting underdog candidates, with John Kerry rising from the single digits to a caucus victory in 2004 and Bill Clinton declaring himself the “comeback kid” when he finished second in New Hampshire’s 1992 primary contest.  Yet those examples, like others often cited by this year’s back-of-the-pack candidates, took place before presidential campaigns had become entirely nationalized. Nowadays, Democrats at campaign rallies in rural Iowa are more likely to recite talking points they have heard on cable news or social media than something they read in their local newspaper.  Collectively, the 10 Democrats who appeared on the debate stage in Houston this month have spent more than twice as much money on Facebook advertisements targeted to Iowans since June 29 than to people in New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, according to data from Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic political firm. No candidate in the race has a bigger chasm between online investments in the first two nominating states than Ms. Harris, of California, who since June 29 has spent $115,178 on Facebook ads in Iowa, but just $2,164 on such ads in New Hampshire. After some grumbling that she had gone more than a month since last visiting the state, Ms. Harris was overheard last week saying she was “moving to Iowa,” with an expletive added for emphasis. Her team announced last week that it would add 60 new staff members and open 10 new offices, and she plans to return weekly until Halloween. Her campaign manager told reporters she was aiming for a “top three” finish in the state. The historically large field has left even the candidates unclear about how many Democrats will have a plausible claim to continue on to New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Ms. Harris called a third place showing a goal but said she did not know if a failure to meet that threshold would doom her campaign. “I honestly don’t know,” she said in an interview before a campaign stop on Friday in Cedar Falls. “I think it will be a confluence of factors that ultimately decides how long anyone stays in and what that means.” A new poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN, released on Saturday night, showed a reordering of the Democratic field. For the first time in The Register’s poll this year, Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, at 22 percent support, led Mr. Biden, who the survey found was the first choice of 20 percent of would-be caucusgoers. Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, placed third, at 11 percent, with Mr. Buttigieg at 9 percent and Ms. Harris at 6 percent.  “This is the first major shake-up” of the race, The Register’s pollster, Ann Selzer,  told the paper .  The poll found that just one in five likely caucusgoers said they had made up their minds, and 63 percent could still be persuaded to shift their support to someone else. Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, who was tied for sixth in the poll, said after presiding over the opening of a new campaign office on Friday in Cedar Rapids that there might be more than twice as many tickets out of Iowa as usual. “You could be No. 6,” Ms. Klobuchar said before the poll results were announced. “I’m really serious, in a 20-person field and people will go, ‘Not bad.’ They’re going to look at who is in the top eight.” Mr. Buttigieg predicted a smaller number of candidates would survive Iowa. “I don’t know how many people can emerge, I think that comes down to how many people voters can keep track of,” he said. “I’d be shocked if it’s more than five.” At the moment, all of the Democratic candidates are chasing Ms. Warren. She is drawing the largest crowds in the field — 2,000 came to see her on Thursday night in Iowa City, two hours after and three miles away from a stop by Ms. Harris in Coralville that drew about 200 to a brewery. Ms. Warren declined on Sunday to take a victory lap over her new Iowa polling standing.  “I don’t do polls,” she said in Detroit,  where she marched with striking autoworkers outside a General Motors plant . “We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.”  A cadre of challengers to Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren are augmenting their Iowa operations, adding staff, opening new offices, collecting endorsements and starting new fund-raising appeals as they aim to create the aura of momentum while building organizations to turn out supporters for the state’s Feb. 3 caucuses. Ms. Klobuchar, from neighboring Minnesota,  has support from more current and former Iowa state lawmakers  than any other 2020 presidential candidate, according to Iowa Starting Line, a local political news website. And Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who tied with Ms. Klobuchar in The Register’s poll, issued an S.O.S. to supporters over the weekend, saying that without an infusion of $1.7 million by the end of the month his campaign might no longer be viable.  While Democrats elsewhere in the country, representing a national party that is increasingly diverse, offer quadrennial grumbling about Iowa, officials here aim to use their status to force the presidential candidates to focus on local issues. J. D. Scholten, a Democrat running for the seat held by Representative Steve King in a 39-county section of northwest Iowa, said he will soon schedule campaign stops across his district with each of the presidential campaigns in towns of 1,000 people or less to test their appeal to rural voters.  “I really want to see the engagement,” Mr. Scholten said at the steak fry on Saturday, which drew a crowd of more than 12,000 people. “I think that’s where I’ll see. No polling can tell me, nothing like that. I want to see whether the people’s heads nod or not.” Lisa Lerer contributed reporting from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Stephanie Saul from Detroit."
"Presidential hopeful Joe Biden says he has never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. He calls on President Trump to release the transcript of his call with the Ukraine. Former Vice President Joe Biden  went on the offense Saturday over  President Trump’s July phone call  with the president of Ukraine, in which Trump reportedly urged the leader to investigate Biden’s son’s dealings in the country -- with Biden backing calls for a House investigation and for the White House to release the transcript of the call. “Trump’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum, and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,” he told reporters in Iowa. NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his role as VP in pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as vice president, worked to protect the company from investigation. On Saturday, Biden said that he had never spoken to Hunter about his business dealings in Ukraine, and backed calls for the House to investigate -- as well as suggesting it could begin a path to impeachment. “Depending on what the House finds, he could be impeached but I’m not making that judgment now,” he said. “The House should investigate it, this appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power.” He went on to call Trump a “serial abuser.” “He abuses power everywhere he can and if he sees any threat to staying in power, he’ll do whatever he has to do -- but this crosses the line,” he said. CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT Biden’s remarks came just hours after Trump dismissed the controversy as a “Ukraine Witch Hunt” being stoked by the Democratic Party and the “fake news media,” and said that the real scandal was to do with Biden’s interactions in the country. “The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won’t get a very large amount of U.S. money, so they fabricate a.story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine,” he tweeted. “Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. The Fake News knows this but doesn’t want to report!” What initially touched off the  controversy is a secret  whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. Trump dismissed the story as “ridiculous"" and a ""partisan hack job"" from the Oval Office on Friday and said his calls with foreign leaders are “always appropriate.” The whistleblower complaint led House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democrats to call for an investigation and for the administration hand over the complaint as well as a transcript of the call -- even as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire declined to share details with lawmakers. Maguire is expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. after being subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee. Schiff had accused Maguire of withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioned whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On Saturday Trump said that the media was turning the story into one about him, as they are trying to “protect” the Democratic frontrunner. “Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden,” he tweeted. “Will fail again!” Fox News' Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"McAleenan called white supremacist extremism is one of the most ""potent ideologies"" driving acts violence in the US.  ""In our modern age, the continued menace of racially based violent extremism, particularly white supremacist extremism, is an abhorrent affront to the nation, the struggle and unity of its diverse population,"" he said in a speech at the Brookings Institution. He pointed to the attacks in  Poway ,  El Paso ,  Pittsburgh  and  Charleston , saying they were motivated by various extremist ideologies, including ""very concerningly and increasingly, white supremacist violent extremism."" According to McAleenan, ISIS and al Qaeda remain the ""two most pressing radical Islamist terrorist threats"" to the US with potential to direct plots and also to inspire homegrown violent extremism in their name.  The strategic announcement  comes just days after a judge ruled  that the American Airlines mechanic accused of trying to sabotage a commercial airliner before takeoff will be held in custody until trial. The judge said during a bond hearing that Ahmed Alani, who allegedly tried to damage or disable an aircraft's air data module system, ""may be very sympathetic to terrorists.""  Alani has been charged with ""willfully damaging, destroying, disabling, or wrecking an aircraft, and attempting to do so,"" according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court earlier this month. No terror-related charges have been filed. President Donald Trump has been criticized for not condemning white supremacy strongly enough, with some accusing him of exacerbating the problem.  Earlier this month, former Vice President Joe Biden connected Trump's rhetoric with the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, saying in a speech that the President has ""fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation."" In August,  CNN reported that White House officials rebuffed efforts  by their colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a year to make combating domestic terror threats, such as those from white supremacists, a greater priority as specifically spelled out in the National Counterterrorism Strategy, sources told CNN. Last October, the  White House unveiled its national counterterrorism strategy , which offered a broad strokes blueprint for how the Trump administration will and already has approached the threat of terrorism, from targeting terrorists at their source to beefing up efforts domestically to tackle the threat of homegrown terrorism.  Recently-ousted national security adviser John Bolton described the new strategy at the time as a sharp departure from President Barack Obama's approach to confronting terrorism, emphasizing the Trump administration's recognition of the threat as one rooted in radical Islamist ideology. ""Radical Islamist terrorist groups still represent the preeminent threat to the United States,"" Bolton said. ""We recognize that there is a terrorist ideology that we're confronting. And I think it's long been the President's view that without recognizing that we're in an ideological struggle, that we can't properly address the terrorist threat."""
"House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., questioned Monday the validity of accusations that President Trump  pressured  the president of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President  Joe Biden's  son. Responding on  ""Fox & Friends,""  Nunes argued that the left is accusing Trump of abusing his office, but Biden is accused of the same thing. ""The very thing they're accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did and admitted that he did,"" said Nunes, decrying that the whistleblower's secrets are ""spilling out"" to various media outlets. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE' Utah Sen.  Mitt Romney , who has recently said he may decline to support  President Trump ’s reelection bid,  tweeted on Sunday  that it would be ‘troubling in the extreme’ if the president appealed to his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter. In a tweet on Sunday, Romney said it was ""critical for the facts to come out.” Trump called his conversations with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy “perfectly fine and routine."" Biden has said in the past  that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden’s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Nunes said the details from the whistleblower complaint still have not been confirmed to Congress. He said the inspector general for the intelligence community met with lawmakers last week, but did not reveal anything. Nunes said the committee is scheduled to meet soon with the acting director of national intelligence, where he hopes more information will be shared. He claimed the story is playing out in a similar way to the Russia collusion accusations. ""Doesn't it feel like the Russia hoax all over again? It's like the Ukrainian hoax,"" he said."
"NYC Councilman Joe Borelli, Democratic strategist Jessica Tarlov and FOX Nation host Kat Timpf weigh in on Joe Biden and President Trump's back and forth over Biden's dealings with Ukraine. A top  Ukrainian  official on Saturday defended  President Trump's  July phone call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during which Trump reportedly urged authorities in Kiev to investigate dealings in the Eastern European county by the son of former Vice President  Joe Biden . “I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,” Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko  told the Hromadske media outlet . ""There was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers."" Zelenskiy's office has not commented on the allegations. Trump and Zelenskiy are expected to meet in person at the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump had repeatedly asked Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden, who had ties to a natural gas firm that was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor as part of a corruption probe. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has suggested that Joe Biden, the current frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, worked while he was vice president to protect his son's company from being investigated. ""President Trump is interested, his advisor, Giuliani, newspapers, Democrats, Republicans are interested in whether pressure had been put on Ukraine,"" Prystaiko said during the same interview. ""I want to say that we are an independent state, we have our own secrets."" BIDEN FACES SCRUTINY FOR DEMANDING OUSTER OF UKRAINE OFFICIAL PROBING FIRM THAT EMPLOYED HIS SON Biden on Saturday denied he has ever spoken to Hunter about his business in Ukraine and called President Trump's actions an ""overwhelming abuse of power."" “Trump’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum, and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,” Biden  told reporters in Iowa  on Saturday. NEW DETAILS ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT President Trump earlier on Saturday tweeted about the ""Ukraine Witch Hunt,"" which he says is a last-ditch effort by the ""Fake News Media"" to protect Biden. ""Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone 'bust' on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden,"" Trump said.

Swamp Media been covering up Biden Family blatant trading on Joe’s offices for years. Joe is part of the protected class. Why would they start now?""

"Webster's dictionary  defines  it, in part, as: ""the externalization of blame, guilt, or responsibility as a defense against anxiety.""  Here's one recent, relevant example: ""The one who's got the problem is Biden, because if you look at what Biden did, Biden did what they would like to have me do except there's one problem: I didn't do it."" That, of course, was President Donald Trump, trying to deflect accusations about the covered-up whistleblower's complaint. It reportedly raised concerns about his call with the Ukrainian President, during which, Trump has essentially admitted, he asked for dirt on a political rival's family. Projection is a regular part of the Trump playbook. He's taken the impulse and elevated it to an effective political tactic. For example, during the 2016 campaign, his favorite attack on his final GOP rival for the nomination was to call him ""Lyin' Ted."" Of course, this comes from a person who lied throughout the campaign and has lied more than 12,000 times as president, according to The Washington Post. Cruz was pretty quick to  diagnose  the problem: ""This man is a pathological liar. He doesn't know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth. And he had a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook. His response is to accuse everybody else of lying.""  This impulse to deflect and project continued in the general election against Hillary Clinton. So, when Trump was accused of being the "" most corrupt candidate ever ,"" she became ""Crooked Hillary."" When Trump came under fire for racist appeals, he  called  Clinton a ""bigot.""  When Clinton raised questions about Trump's erratic and impulsive behavior, he  called her unstable , unhinged, lacking the ""judgment, temperament and moral character to lead this country."" And who can forget his, ""No puppet ... You're the puppet,"" response when she accused him in a debate of being a puppet for Vladimir Putin.  To be sure, that one was more of an impulsive bleat than evidence of strategy, but of course the pattern of projection has continued in the White House:   For example, during the Mueller investigation, when he kept  asserting  without evidence that ""there was no Collusion except bye Crooked Hillary and the Democrats."" And in  saying that Russia really wanted Clinton to win  -- despite Putin saying the exact opposite. These projections may be absurd, but they serve a serious political purpose. They muddy the water between fact and fiction and make people think that everyone is guilty of what Trump's been credibly accused of. This increases apathy and cynicism in our democracy by aiming to obliterate citizens' ability to recognize reality.  Because tone comes from the top, you see the President's surrogates and even Cabinet officials echo it. But sometimes they go too far and give away the game. Case in point,  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  on ""Face The Nation"":  ""If there was election interference that took place by the Vice President, I think the American people deserve to know.""  I'm sorry, what's that now? Because literally no one is suggesting that Joe Biden was involved in election interference. But, of course, that's exactly what President Trump is being accused of, and if you can't defend the President's alleged actions, you just deflect and project. Here's the thing: Projection is actually a sign of deep insecurity. Which makes you wonder about the President's favorite insults, which he deploys over and over again on Twitter. An analysis by The Washington Post's Philip Bump found that  his top five insults  were ""fake,"" ""failed,"" ""dishonest,"" ""weak"" and ""liar."" It's enough to make you think President Trump doesn't actually think of himself as a ""very stable genius"" after all."

"National security attorney Bradley Moss and attorney Harmeet Dhillon weigh in on the whistleblower complaint. President Trump  said in a tweet that he will release on Wednesday a transcript of his July phone call to Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky , in which they reportedly discussed an investigation involving Joe Biden. ""I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,"" Trump wrote. ""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!"" Trump added: ""The Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it, including legislation on gun safety, lowering of prescription drug prices, infrastructure, etc. So bad for our Country!"" Department of Justice lawyers, as well as lawyers at the White House, have been advising White House officials to release the transcript since last week, a source familiar with the conversations told Fox News. The dramatic ""flip-the-script"" moment could blunt Democrats' newly energized  push to begin a formal impeachment inquiry , based on a whistleblower's allegation that the president pressed the new Ukrainian leader during the phone call to investigate the former vice president and his son Hunter. But Democrats were sure to continue their push for the whistleblower's full complaint and testimony, which could provide additional details. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Tuesday afternoon that testimony from the whistleblower might be imminent. ""We have been informed by the whistleblower’s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI [Director of National Intelligence] as to how to do so,"" Schiff said in a tweet. ""We‘re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week."" It was unclear if Acting DNI Joseph Maguire would provide that guidance. Maguire is expected to testify himself before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday -- but Maguire has refused to share some information, including the complaint. A source familiar with the matter  told Fox News this week  that the whistleblower did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president. And Yahoo News  reported  that the GOP-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee had  written to the whistleblower's attorney, requesting a bipartisan closed-door interview . At the same time, the matter  threatened to shine a harsh spotlight  on the Bidens' activities in Ukraine, and top Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., warned the situation could ""backfire"" on Democrats. ""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who believe Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy. Joe Biden  has acknowledged  that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm  Burisma Holdings  — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

       Top Trump surrogates, including his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, have long said that Ukraine should investigate that matter fully. And Trump has long said he wants European countries to pay more for their own defense. An administration official  told the Wall Street Journal  that Trump's actions on the call with Zelensky in July ""reflected the president’s concerns about how the U.S. is spending aid money and whether U.S. allies are adequately contributing."" In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine  a ""disgrace,""  and added: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?” Still, there were other indications that releasing the transcript would not fully satisfy the  growing chorus  of Democrats calling for an impeachment inquiry. In a statement on Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., strongly suggested that impeachment might be on the table if the whistleblower's full complaint was not provided to Congress. ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi said. She was expected to get behind an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday. Several commentators also cast skepticism on Trump's announcement within minutes. ""Nixon released his own transcripts of the Oval Office tapes — which turned out to be wildly misleading,"" said historian  Kevin Cruse.

"Trump, who was in the middle of a broad review of foreign aid programs when he singled out Ukraine specifically this summer, was primarily concerned with ""corruption"" in Ukraine and Europe shouldering more of the financial burden for supporting Ukraine's defense, according to one of the officials. News of Trump's order to withhold aid to the Ukraine ahead of his July 25 call may trigger questions -- and speculation -- about the President's motive in doing so.  Trump had ordered a hold on nearly $400 million of military and security aid to Ukraine at least a week before the call in question, US officials familiar with the matter tell CNN.  The Washington Post  first reported the figure. The administration was looking at harnessing multiple foreign packages, several aides believed, when Trump took a special interest in Ukraine, at times railing about how the country wasted money in his eyes. This surprised several staffers because, as CNN has reported, Trump had not been interested in engaging with Ukraine in the past, believing Ukraine was a corrupt country that wasn't committed to reform.  But his attentiveness to the country had ramped up in recent weeks as his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani pushed muddled corruption accusations against Biden, who was leading in national polls against Trump, and his son Hunter.  There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. On Friday, CNN  reported  Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. On the day of Trump's call with Zelensky, word began to spread that Trump was reviewing a plan to cut foreign assistance to Ukraine. That call was part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. Trump on Sunday  said  that he did indeed discuss Biden with Ukraine's president -- at a time when the country was awaiting the aid package from the United States -- but he denied doing anything improper. Neither Trump nor his aides have given another reason why his administration singularly stalled the Ukrainian aid package for several weeks.  Citing three senior administration officials with knowledge of the internal deliberations, the Post said officials at the Office of Management and Budget passed along Trump's request to the Pentagon and the State Department at an interagency meeting in mid-July.  According to the paper, administration officials were told to tell lawmakers that the delay in aid was the result of an ""interagency process"" without giving more information.  The growing controversy has brought House Democrats near a ""tipping point"" on impeachment as the party weighs how to respond to the incident. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who sharpened her rhetoric over the weekend, is still not committing to moving forward with impeachment proceedings -- though she is keeping the door open. This story has been updated with CNN reporting from two senior administration officials."
"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in New York on Monday to take part in the United Nations General Assembly. But his debut on the world stage has already been overshadowed by  questions about a July 25 conversation  with US President Donald Trump.  In the latest development, two senior administration officials said Trump requested a hold on millions in  military aid  to Ukraine roughly one week before a call in which Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son.  Trump  tweeted Tuesday  he has ""authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" of his phone call with Zelensky, and said there was ""no pressure, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!"" Leave aside for a moment whether that was ever likely to happen: Andriy Yermak, an aide to Zelensky, said in an interview published Monday that Ukraine would not open or close investigations ""on command.""  Many Ukrainians are concerned the US political drama benefits their powerful neighbor, Russian President Vladimir Putin.  In an interview with CNN, former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin said that the scandal surrounding the telephone conversation is undermining Ukraine's fight against Russia, which occupied and annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has backed separatists in the country's east.  Klimkin said the scandal will undermine Kiev and play into the hands of Putin. Asked to guess what the Kremlin is likely thinking about the Trump phone scandal, Klimkin said: ""They are definitely (thinking), 'Open the champagne.' For them it is the best way to drive a wedge in (the) unique -- and I really mean unique -- bipartisan support for Ukraine. (The) United States for the past five years has been the most important ally, not only in the sense of military aid, not only in the sense of pressure and sanctions but fundamentally leading the international community, so now the Russians should be crazy happy about it.""  Klimkin told CNN he has no direct knowledge of what was discussed in the Trump phone call. He has not seen a transcript or been briefed on the call despite holding the position of foreign minister at the time, because he had submitted his resignation before the call.  But many Ukrainians are learning about what it means to be pulled into a US domestic political drama.  On CNN, journalist and former Ukrainian government official Serhiy Leshchenko appeared on ""Cuomo Prime Time""  to counter a false allegation  by Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani said a Ukrainian court had found Leshchenko guilty of producing a phony affidavit given to US officials to intervene in American elections. On Twitter, Leshchenko said he appeared on the show to ""confront disinformation statements of Rudy Giuliani about me and Ukraine,"" adding: ""We are looking for bipartisan support of Ukraine to make ... Europe (a) safer place."" Daria Kaleniuk, an anti-corruption activist in Ukraine, made a similar point. The main beneficiary of the scandal, she argued on Twitter, was Russia. ""Both Ukraine and the US are (losing),""  she wrote on Twitter .  The discussion about Ukraine's future, many Ukrainians fear, is being drowned out by the noise surrounding that unusual call in July."
"The Wall Street Journal reports that in a July phone call, President Trump repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son. President Trump  faced fresh calls for impeachment on Friday after a new report claimed Trump asked the president of Ukraine numerous times in a single phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. Biden said on Friday that the claim has no credibility. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary  Julian Castro , a  2020 candidate , responded to the report by calling Trump a ""criminal"" who need to be impeached ""immediately."" WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., renewed his impeachment calls on Friday, accusing Trump of ""moral vandalism."" ""This story is stunning and should be shaking Washington right now -- Donald Trump's moral vandalism disqualifies him from being president. As I've said before, it's time for impeachment proceedings,"" he tweeted. Fellow 2020 contender  Beto O'Rouke  had already called for impeachment in reaction to statements made by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's attorney, on Thursday night. ""When will Congress have the courage to act?"" he asked in an apparent dig at leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. DEMOCRATS AREN'T ACTUALLY IMPEACHING THE PRESIDENT-- YET, BUT THEY ARE DIGGING DEEP Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, claimed the House had ""no choice"" but to impeach after the Journal's report surfaced. ""Everything Nixon did during Watergate pales in comparison to Trump using the power of the Presidency to pressure a foreign leader who needs U.S. Aid to investigate a political opponent,"" Pfeiffer said. The whistleblower controversy seemed to raise even more concerns among the 2020 field, many of whom already called for the president's impeachment. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , called on Friday for the whistleblower to come forward, offering protection as he defied the administration. She also suggested that Trump was trying to interfere in the 2020 election like, according to her, he did in 2016. ""He has openly invited interference and now we have information that suggests that again, he is engaged in that kind of behavior,"" she said at a campaign stop. ""What he fails to understand is that he is the President of the United States and that office ... is the people's office -- not his office,"" she added. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., didn't directly address the report on Twitter but did dispute Trump's attorneys' claims that he couldn't be criminally prosecuted. ""Yes, he can,"" she tweeted on Friday after the Journal's report surfaced. Trump, for his part, has denied any wrongdoing. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The Radical Left Democrats and their Fake News Media partners, headed up again by Little Adam Schiff, and batting Zero for 21 against me, are at it again!"" he tweeted, referring to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

""Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not?

"The Democratic field got a little bit smaller this week,  shrinking to 19 candidates . Here’s our weekly catch-up on the  2020 election  and some moments you may have missed. ‘Clearly not my time’ Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who entered the Democratic presidential race on the hopes that his brand of urban progressive leadership could appeal on a national scale,  said on Friday that he was ending his candidacy . Breaking: Bill de Blasio announces he is ending his presidential campaign  pic.twitter.com/vL8GcX3xV5 — Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe)  September 20, 2019 
 Mr. de Blasio’s campaign never quite caught on, and his announcement came less than two weeks before the qualification deadline for the  October debate . His inclusion in the event was growing less likely by the day.  “I feel like I’ve contributed all I can to this primary campaign, and it’s clearly not my time,” he said in an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “I’m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City, and I’m going to keep speaking up for working people.” Read more about  Mr. de Blasio’s exit here .  And here’s  our magazine piece  about his journey from progressive hope to punching bag. A big day for Warren  Monday was big for Senator  Elizabeth Warren  of Massachusetts.  She  received the endorsement of the Working Families Party , a labor-aligned progressive group that endorsed Senator  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont  during the last presidential cycle .  She released a 6,000-word  anti-corruption plan , which would make the release of tax returns automatic for candidates for federal office, make it illegal for elected officials to become lobbyists and strengthen ethics requirements for federal judges.  And in a speech at a rally in Manhattan that drew thousands to Washington Square Park, she forcefully attacked corruption and invoked the power of women to bring about sweeping change.  Ms. Warren delivered the speech blocks from the site of the  Triangle shirtwaist factory fire  of 1911, which killed 146 garment workers, most of them immigrant women. It was one of the deadliest industrial disasters in the nation’s history. “The tragic story of the Triangle factory fire is a story about power,” Ms. Warren said. “A story of what happens when the rich and the powerful take control of government and use it to increase their own profits while they stick it to working people. But what happened in the aftermath of the fire is a different story about power — a story about our power, a story about what’s possible when we fight together as one.” Our colleague Alexander Burns noted that in dueling speeches Monday night, Ms. Warren and President Trump  laid out competing visions of populism . Sanders shakes up his operation With five months to go before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Sanders  overhauled his operations in the state , which he won by more than 22 percentage points in 2016.  Mr. Sanders, who hails from neighboring Vermont, almost certainly must win New Hampshire again next year to have a chance at the nomination. The campaign also parted ways with its political director in Iowa,  according to a report  that surfaced later in the week.  Read more  about that move here. ‘A sham process’: Democrats call for Kavanaugh’s impeachment Several candidates called for the impeachment of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh after The New York Times published  new information  about allegations of sexual misconduct against him. Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Senator Kamala Harris of California were among those who called for the justice’s impeachment. “He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice,” Ms. Harris wrote. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called the revelations “profoundly troubling” but stopped short of demanding impeachment. Instead, he called for an investigation into “whether the Trump administration and Senate Republicans pressured the F.B.I. to ignore evidence.” Read  our full report  on the calls for impeachment. Regulating marijuana like alcohol Former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas  released a plan  on Thursday to legalize marijuana, expunge all possession convictions and regulate the substance the way alcohol is regulated. Sales would be limited to adults, smoking would be banned in public areas, and advertising would be restricted.  He also wants to tax the marijuana industry and invest the revenue in the communities of color disproportionately affected by the war on drugs.  Every Democratic candidate supports decriminalizing marijuana, and most, including Mr. O’Rourke, support full legalization. But six candidates — Mr. Biden, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., and former Representative Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania — want to leave the question of legalization up to the states. In other policy news: Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey  unveiled a plan  to bolster workers’ rights. It would protect the right to organize for all workers, including those in the gig economy; end anti-union “right-to-work” laws; and change the way capital gains are taxed. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., released  a disaster preparedness plan  to help communities prepare for and recover from storms. It aims to improve coordination between federal agencies and storm victims, fortify infrastructure and strengthen the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Mr. Buttigieg also detailed his  “Medicare for All Who Want It” plan , which seeks to ensure universal access to coverage by allowing all Americans to opt in to a public-coverage alternative.  Mr. Sanders  introduced a $2.5 trillion housing proposal  that calls for more public and affordable housing,  as well as a national rent control law  that would cap annual rent increases at 3 percent or one and a half times the inflation rate, whichever was higher.  Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund executive, released a  “justice-centered climate plan ,” which he said would create nearly   46 million jobs over 10 years. He also promised to create a civilian climate corps as part of a broad  “national service plan ,” which would aim for a million annual participants by 2025.  And finally ... Overheard on the campaign trail? “I’m moving to Iowa,”  Ms. Harris joked in a comment   to Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii that included an expletive and was overheard by a reporter. The state of California did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Ms. Harris’s remark came as  her campaign announced a new push in the state . In a call with reporters Thursday morning, aides said they hoped to position Ms. Harris for a late-breaking Iowa surge. And they set a firm target: a top-three finish. Ms. Harris’s team sent out a fund-raising email based on her quip. And, of course,  there are already T-shirts . "

"""Look, my position remains the same. I think impeachment would be terribly divisive for our already very divided country,"" Gabbard said in an interview with CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""I think Congress needs to exercise oversight over the information that's been leaked. I think it's important this transcript is released to Congress so that Congress can do its job."" The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, in the past, has  cautioned against  impeaching Trump. Her comments on Tuesday came shortly before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  announced a formal impeachment inquiry  into the President. ""The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said in doing so. Trump faces outrage over reports that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son, Hunter. Trump on Sunday said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Zelensky -- at a time when the country was awaiting the aid package from the United States -- but he denied doing anything improper. The call is also the subject of a whistleblower complaint. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. House Democrats'  calls for impeachment have grown louder  amid the growing controversy, and seven freshman Democrats wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post calling for an impeachment inquiry. When asked why she thought those lawmakers were wrong, Gabbard said she thinks it's important that the transcript of the conversations are released and Congress makes a ""decision based on the facts."" ""It's important Donald Trump is voted out of office by the American people,"" she told Baldwin. Gabbard, who  qualified  for the October Democratic debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times, is the first and only 2020 Democratic presidential candidate to clearly say she does not support moving to impeach Trump. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Kamala Harris of California have all said they support impeachment. And bestselling author and activist Marianne Williamson said in a statement Tuesday that though she has been ""cautious on the topic of impeachment,"" she now believes an impeachment inquiry into Trump is the ""right thing to do."" Pelosi's historic Tuesday announcement marks the most direct step taken by the House Democratic leader to embrace impeachment proceedings and is a significant escalation in the fight between House Democrats and the President."

"Now the future of those benefits is at the heart of an emerging split among  2020 Democratic candidates  over how to remake American health care. Former Vice President Joe Biden says union members shouldn't have to give up their employer plans if they like them, while Sen. Bernie Sanders is arguing that union workers would still come out ahead under ""Medicare for All,"" which would shift all Americans into a government-run plan. The fight puts Sanders, a declared democratic socialist, at odds with some in the labor movement, where many union workers already have insurance with pretty good benefits. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is also seeking the nomination, is in a similar situation because of her support for both Medicare for All and organized labor. Already, there's a growing divide among unions as to whether to back Sanders' universal coverage proposal. National Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses, are very vocal supporters of Medicare for All. But the International Association of Fire Fighters opposes  eliminating employer-based coverage . Still other unions, such as the Service Employees International Union, say they support all efforts to expand coverage to more people. Roughly 10.5% of workers -- or 14.7 million people -- were union members in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about half the share that were unionized 35 years earlier. Some 95% of union workers had access to employer medical benefits in 2019, compared to 68% of non-union workers, according to the bureau's data. And they were more likely to participate in the plans, with 84% of union staffers signing up, compared to 54% of their non-union counterparts.  ""Bargaining for health benefits is a distinguishing characteristic that labor unions hold out as an important variable as to why you would want to be a union member,"" said David Brenner, national director of multi-employer consulting at Segal Consulting, a leader in the field.  The quality of their health plans varies widely, experts said. Unions that cover a lot of lower-wage employees, such as custodians or nurse's aides, may have more basic benefits and have to pay more for them. But other unions, including those in the construction,  auto industry and some hotel trades, have more generous policies -- with low premiums, deductibles and co-pays. A few have even set up their own health clinics for members to get care. Many health packages are so comprehensive that unions feared getting hit with the Affordable Care Act's Cadillac tax, which would have slapped a levy on the value of employer-provided coverage above a certain threshold. Companies and unions quickly banded together to fight it, fearing they'd have to curtail workers' health benefits. The implementation date has been delayed twice, and the House recently voted to  repeal the provision . The United Auto Workers, who are currently striking against General Motors, are among the unions with high-quality plans. Members pay only about 3% of the total cost of their health care, while salaried staffers have to cover about one-third, according to GM. Until recently, the automaker had been seeking to shift more of the bill to the UAW workforce. But GM has dropped its request for major changes in the health care plan. Talks are now hung up on other issues, including pay, the use of temporary workers and a union demand to shift work from Mexico to facilities slated to close in the US. However, GM has also  stopped paying for health insurance  for the striking workers, who will have to sign up for COBRA. The UAW's strike fund is picking up the cost. Sanders took the opportunity earlier this week to note that  union members wouldn't have to fear  losing their benefits during strikes under Medicare for All. Medical benefits is a central component of most contract negotiations. Health care is a major expense for most companies, and they have been pushing more of the cost onto non-union employees for years. They want organized labor to contribute more too. But union workers are willing to make sacrifices to shield their health care coverage, including curtailing raises or other benefits. ""In an awful lot of cases, workers are forgoing any increase in wages in order to keep their deductibles from going even higher,"" said Tom Leibfried, legislative representative for the AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 national and international labor unions that represent 12.5 million people. There's also a growing trend of contract talks breaking down in part over health benefits, said Alex Colvin, dean of Cornell University's ILR School, formerly known as the School of Industrial and Labor Relations. Health coverage was among the issues in United Steelworkers' strike against National Grid in Massachusetts and the teachers' strike in West Virginia last year. ""There's a lot more labor unrest and the cost of health care is one of the drivers of that,"" Brenner said. Health care is important to union workers for several reasons, said Shaun Richman, program director at the SUNY Empire State College's School of Labor Studies who also was a deputy director of organizing for the American Federation of Teachers. ""You can take a higher raise to the bank, but when your kid gets sick, the peace of mind of good health insurance is important,"" Richman said. Also, ""it's a badge of honor of maintaining the health insurance and not taking concessions on it.""  Recognizing that he needs unions' support, Sanders issued a  Workplace Democracy plan  last month that would require companies to pass along savings resulting from Medicare for All to workers in the form of raises or other benefits. Unions would be allowed to maintain their clinics and provide supplemental coverage, as long as it doesn't duplicate the benefits available under Medicare for All. A Warren aide told CNN recently that the campaign is talking with labor leaders about how unions with negotiated health care plans will be guaranteed a chance to rework their agreements during a Medicare for All transition. That may not be enough for some unions, though. ""There has to be a role for the hard-fought, high-quality plans that we've negotiated,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told Fox News earlier this month. ""If there isn't some way for us to have our plans integrated into the system, then we would have a hard time supporting it."""

Members of the Hawkeye Marching Band allege that they were subjected to racial slurs and other verbal abuse, and sexual harassment before, during and after the game. Two band members told the  Cedar Rapids Gazette  that a third band member, a woman was hospitalized with fractured ribs.

       Administrators at the two schools announced earlier in the week that they had looked into the allegations, but they didn't say whether anyone would face punishment. Iowa's athletic director, Gary Barta, and his Iowa State counterpart, Jamie Pollard, released a joint statement saying members of both schools' bands had been subjected to ""rude, vulgar, and in some cases violent"" conduct at football games in recent years, and urging fans to stop the behavior. FOOTBALL FAN WHO REQUESTED BEER MONEY ON TV REVEALS HE'S RAISED $820G FOR CHILDREN'S CHARITY In response, 21-year-old Corey Knopp, who plays tenor sax for the Iowa Marching Band, posted his account of the abuse following the game, which Iowa won 18-17. ""People were physically assaulted,"" Knopp said. ""We expect to get booed and cussed at. But never for violence to take place...Put yourself in our shoes. Kids. Marching in formation back to our busses after a long day. Getting shoved and having beer cans shaken and sprayed at our feet. Getting slapped because of the words on our uniform (IOWA). Getting pushed so hard that someone’s (not going to name this person) ribs are broken. That is completely unacceptable."" BERNIE SANDERS' IOWA POLITICAL DIRECTOR HAS LEFT CAMPAIGN, REPORTS SAY Knopp also detailed to the Gazette how an Iowa State fan shoved him as they were marching back to the team buses. ""He decided to cut through the band and shoved me out of his way. I yelled, ‘Do not put your hands on me sir,’ and he yelled back, ‘F--k you.’” Nathan Topping, a 19-year-old trumpet player, told the Gazette a full beer bottle was thrown at him, causing what he described as a ""nasty bruise."" ""It was the fans,"" said Paige Pearson, 20, who plays trumpet in the Iowa band. ""The Iowa State band has been nothing but kind. They've reached out to us and said sorry this happened. It was not even the students, but adult fans."" University of Iowa spokeswoman Jeneane Beck said Friday that the social media posts made it clear that the university hadn’t adequately conveyed to its students what it had done to address the band members’ concerns, the Gazette reported. “Student safety is our number one priority and we are committed to ensuring a safe experience on game day for our students,” Beck said. “Additionally we are continuing our investigation to ensure all of our students have the ability to share their experiences with the appropriate authorities.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Iowa officials said Friday in a message to band members that Barta and Pollard “have been actively engaged in the process and have publicly pledged to ensure better protections for students moving forward.” The Associated Press contributed to this report. "
"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Sen.  Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., surged ahead of former Vice President  Joe Biden  in a new poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers released late Saturday, with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and South Bend, Ind. Mayor  Pete Buttigieg  slipping into a distant third and fourth, respectively. The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll  showed Warren as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. By comparison, the Register poll in June showed Biden leading with 24 percent support, nine percentage points clear of Warren and eight points clear of Sanders. J. Ann Selzer, president of pollster Selzer & Co., told the Register the survey represented ""the first major shakeup” of the Iowa race, because: ""It’s the first time we’ve had someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the leader board."" BIDEN GOES ON THE ATTACK OVER UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, PLEDGES TO BEAT TRUMP 'LIKE A DRUM' Sanders was in third place with 11 percent support, a five percentage-point drop from the Register's June poll. No other candidate cracked 10 percent of the first-choice vote, with Buttigieg garnering nine percent. That also represents a five percentage-point drop from June. Warren also had the highest percentage of poll respondents (20 percent) who said she was their second choice in the February caucus. By contrast, Biden and Sanders each garnered 10 percent of the second-choice vote. Warren also had the highest favorability rating of any candidate, with 75 percent of respondents saying they had a very or mostly favorable view of her compared to 66 percent for Biden and 58 percent for Sanders. BERNIE SANDERS RELEASES PLAN TO ELIMINATE $81B IN PAST-DUE MEDICAL DEBT Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., rounded out the top five, with six percent of voters saying she was their first choice. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Cory Booker, D-NJ, both received three percent. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and hedge fund manager Tom Steyer each received three percent. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The polling shakeup may not be done, as 63 percent of respondents said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. Harris, Buttigieg and Booker could still benefit from late deciders, as 39 percent, 37 percent and 35 percent of poll respondents said they were still actively considering those respective candidates. The poll came from a sample size of 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. It was conducted from Sept. 14-18. The most recent  Fox News poll  of Democratic primary voters nationwide showed Biden with 29 percent support, down six percentage points from his peak in May. Sanders was in second place at 18 percent, up eight percentage points from the previous month's poll, while Warren was on 16 percent, down four points from August."
"Per a  CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll  released Saturday, Warren has for the first time taken the lead among likely caucusgoers in that key first primary state, climbing seven points since June. And Warren appears poised to rise further if other Democrats drop out or falter in the race, given that the poll finds she's the top second choice among all other Democratic candidates. Twenty percent would choose Warren as a second choice while Biden and Bernie Sanders are each only the  second choice of 10% .  Biden still currently leads Warren in the Real Clear Politics average of polls on a national level by a  little over ten points .  But Warren has been slowly building support in a way that may not only lead her to win the nomination, but to win the White House come 2020. Why? It's simple: Warren is increasingly exciting people about her candidacy. This is backed by a new NBC/WSJ poll released Sunday which finds that among all the 2020 Democratic candidates, she is now the top-tier candidate who the largest amount of registered voters (17%) are "" enthusiastic "" about. While that number has grown from just 8 percent in March, the percentage of voters who are enthusiastic about Trump has remained the same at 26%. Biden, however, has seen the opposite trend. In March, 17% of voters were enthusiastic about him, but now the former VP has slipped to 12%. That's not good. Enthusiasm should only be growing the more people see a candidate in debates and on the campaign trail. True, enthusiasm is an intangible factor that can come and go, often quickly. But it's enthusiasm that inspires people to not just vote, but to get friends to vote. It's that passion that animates people to knock on doors for a candidate, make phone calls, give money and attend events. In fact, just this past week, we saw an example of Warren enthusiasm on display when she held a rally in New York City and some  20,000 people  reportedly attended. The massive crowd clearly unnerved Trump, who loves to brag that he draws the largest audiences. When asked about the rally by reporters, Trump did his best to downplay it,  saying , ""No. 1, she didn't have 20,000 people and No. 2, I think anybody would get a good crowd there.""  But it wasn't just the New York City rally, Warren has been  increasingly drawing impressive, energetic crowds,  such as in August when 15,000 people came to her rally in Seattle and 12,000 attended another rally in St. Paul, Minnesota.  How did Warren climb from  single digits  in national polls in March to now topping Biden in the new Iowa poll?  She hit all the right notes with Democrats and especially with the progressive wing of the party. Her debate performances have been consistently very good. Warren's  'I have a plan for that' mantra  where she has released detailed plans for policy issues facing our nation from childcare to anti-corruption to criminal justice reform --  and the list goes on  -- has resonated with voters. She has also been very outspoken on another issue supported by approximately  70% of Democrats : Impeaching Trump.  Warren was the first major presidential candidate to  call for impeaching the President  back in April, just days after Robert Mueller's report was released. And on Friday after  allegations were reported  that Trump spoke to the Ukrainian President in July and pressured him to investigate Biden and Biden's son Hunter in an obvious effort to get dirt on Biden, Warren went a step further.  She took to Twitter slamming Democrats in Congress for failing to act, writing, ""After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment. By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump's latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections.""  She added , ""Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president.""  In contrast,  Biden's first response  to reporters on the issue was understandably more defensive: ""Not one single credible outlet has given credibility to these assertions. Not one single one,"" adding, ""So I have no comment other than the president should start to be president."" Later that night Biden put out  a more forceful statement  saying if the allegations are true, it is ""clear-cut corruption.""   However, as someone who speaks to the progressives nightly on my SiriusXM radio show, I can tell you firsthand that Warren's words and sentiment line up perfectly with the frustration many rank and file Democrats have with the Democrats in Congress on this issue.  Between now and the 2020 election a great deal can change. But if Warren and Biden continue along their current trajectory, Trump should fear Warren as much, if not more, than Biden."
"David Webb, Donna Brazile and A.B. Stoddard on whether not Joe Biden will win the African-American vote. Former Vice President Joe Biden will need to rely on ""older"" African-American voters if he hopes to win the White House in 2020, according to A.B. Stoddard. “This age divide in the African-American electorate is the crux of Joe Biden’s viability,” Stoddard told  “The Daily Briefing”  with Dana Perino. “If he loses older African-Americans along with his non-college white support, he won’t be the nominee,” she said. The comments came after The New York Times ran a column titled,  “Young Black Voters to Their Biden-Supporting Parents: ‘Is This Your King?”  The piece looked at views of younger black voters, which in many case differ from theirs of their older counterparts. FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN AT NEW LOW IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE Stoddard said that the reason older African-Americans support the former vice president is that “they are afraid” and want to beat  President Trump . “They believe that the Obama presidency led to a flare-up of racism in this country, and President Donald Trump. They want to beat him,” she said. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS Stoddard went on to say that older black voters believe the new direction of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party -- its vow to decriminalize border crossings, take away private insurance and stand up for other “radical positions” -- is “out of step with the country.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden  has been considered the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination since before he even entered the race. However, while he currently still leads the field, his support has been diminishing, according to a new Fox News Poll. Biden has the support of 29 percent of Democratic primary voters, according to the poll. That figure is down from 31 percent in August and 35 percent in May. His current 11-point lead is down from a high of 19 points in June."
"WASHINGTON — The Democratic National Committee said on Monday that it would demand a slight increase in the polling and fund-raising thresholds that presidential candidates must meet in order to qualify for the party’s November  primary debate , a move that may once again shrink the field of participating candidates.  To be invited to the November debate, candidates must have received donations from at least 165,000 individual donors and must meet one of two polling requirements. They must either receive 3 percent support in four national or early-state polls conducted by qualifying pollsters, or 5 percent support in two polls in the four early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.  Polls will count if they were publicly released between Sept. 13 and midnight seven days before the debate. The date and location of the November debate have yet to be announced.

 At least 11 candidates have already met the 165,000-donor threshold, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Only three qualifying polls have been released since Sept. 13., and two of them were national polls, meaning no candidates have fully qualified for the November debate yet. Candidates must also prove they have at least 600 unique donors in at least 20 states, United States territories or the District of Columbia, the D.N.C. said. As the Democratic primary has progressed, party officials have gradually tightened the standards for debate qualification, making it harder and harder to clear the bar.  The 20 candidates who participated in the two-night debates held in June and July only had to amass donations from 65,000 people or reach 1 percent support in three qualifying polls. The qualification standards for this month’s debate were much stricter: Candidates were required to collect donations from 130,000 unique donors and achieve 2 percent support in four qualifying polls.  Only 10 candidates cleared the higher bar and  the debate was held over just one night . With the addition of Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund investor, 11 candidates have already qualified for the October debate, which has the same requirements. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii needs just one more qualifying poll result to make the cut. The repeated tightening of the standards has caused considerable consternation among the candidates,  causing many to gripe about the rules  and nudging some to drop out of the race altogether. Aides to several of the second-tier candidates feared that Tom Perez, the D.N.C. chairman, would raise the bar much higher, effectively limiting the debate field to just a handful of candidates. The modest threshold increase for the November debate came as a relief to on-the-bubble campaigns that had been preparing for a requirement of up to 260,000 individual donors, which would have forced unpleasant decisions about whether to divert resources from grass-roots organizing to online advertising in search of new donors. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York ,  Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington  and  John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor , exited the race in August after it became clear that they would not qualify for the fall debates. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York  dropped out  last week after failing to qualify for the September debate and realizing he stood almost no chance of getting onstage next month. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who both participated in the September debate and have qualified for the October one, have in recent weeks emailed appeals to supporters warning they could be left off the stage in November and December without an uptick in their fund-raising.  Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey  sent a message to supporters over the weekend , saying that without an infusion of $1.7 million by the end of the month his campaign may no longer be viable. On Monday, he sent another email acknowledging the newly released debate thresholds, noting that he had not reached 165,000 individual donors and asking supporters to chip in. According to the Times analysis, he is the only candidate who has participated in all of the debates and has not yet reached 165,000 donors. Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, who did not qualify for the September debate and is not likely to make the stage for October’s, has been one of the most vocal critics of the process.  He renewed his attacks this month after it became clear that Mr. Steyer would qualify for the October debate after using millions of dollars of his own money to buy advertisements that have helped him draw in donations and increase his standing in the polls.  “At this point, there isn’t much left to be said regarding a set of rules that have allowed a billionaire to bankroll his way onto the debate stage, while governors and senators with decades of public service experience have been forced out of the race,” said Mr. Bullock, who has failed to earn 2 percent in a single qualifying poll. “This process is failing Democrats and does nothing to help us beat Donald Trump next November.” The D.N.C.’s announcement may begin a new cycle of protests and recriminations from candidates who do not qualify. But  while riding on a campaign bus in Iowa  on Sunday, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who seems likely to make the November debate stage, was circumspect. “I think it’s mission impossible for the D.N.C. to please everybody,” he said. Maggie Astor contributed reporting."
"Uncertainty within the market is why some farmers in Nebraska are urging Congress to pass the proposed trade deal known as the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA). The leaders of the United States, Mexico and Canada have already signed the most important trade deal in a  generation . Mexico and Canada, not China, are currently our two largest trading partners. For the sake of America’s economy and workers, this deal needs to get done. The only obstacle is political obstruction by congressional Democrats more intent on depriving President Trump of a win than bestowing one on the American people. This is politics at its worst, and that’s saying something. NEWT GINGRICH: DEM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DOING A GREAT JOB SHOWING VOTERS WHY TRUMP SHOULD BE REELECTED The United States stands to make immense economic gains from this comprehensive renegotiation of the deeply flawed 1994  North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA). The importance of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is widely recognized on both sides of the political aisle, yet more than nine months after the signing ceremony, it lingers in Congress, unratified, undebated and uncertain. As a “non-self-executing treaty,” both Houses of  Congress  have to pass the USMCA before it can take effect. Like all treaties of this magnitude, the deal deserves careful debate. But, given its broad popularity, the process should be much further along by now. The question isn’t whether the deal is worth making, but rather why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is preventing debate. Various Democratic lawmakers have suggested that they might wish to tweak certain aspects of the agreement, but so far they’ve largely avoided even learning about the details. The reasons for ratifying the USMCA as quickly as possible are readily apparent. NAFTA was poorly negotiated, typical of an era of very bad trade dealings by American leaders that hurt the people they should protect the most. Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana — two Republicans from the heartland constituencies hit hardest by NAFTA’s shortcomings — both published very persuasive arguments this past week explaining why the USMCA is so beneficial for the United States. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER They point to the higher wages and labor protections that will be, for the first time, imposed on Mexican factories that produce goods for the U.S. market. Many Mexican auto workers, for example, will have to earn at least $16 per hour in order for the cars they make to qualify for tariff-free export to America. That will decrease incentives to offshore American manufacturing jobs and give workers in Detroit a fair chance to compete. American farmers, meanwhile, will gain easier access to Canadian and Mexican markets — something they’ve been seeking in vain for decades. But while Trump was the mastermind behind the USMCA, it’s not just Republicans who are convinced of the agreement’s merits, or at least eager to keep the ball moving forward. In July, 14 House Democrats signed a letter to Pelosi urging her to let the House vote on the USMCA before year-end. We need to replace NAFTA, and Democratic leadership is the only thing standing in the way. The principles behind this deal are neither partisan nor ideological — getting a better deal for American workers and requiring more robust labor and environmental protections from our trading partners are goals that the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have explicitly endorsed, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, even as she rejects the USMCA. The Warren example sheds a revealing light on Pelosi’s obstructionism. It’s clear as day why Warren is opposing USMCA. She’s running for president against the man whose vision and determination made the deal a reality. Of course, she opposes it. Warren’s cover story is that she thinks the USMCA is too lenient on pharmaceutical companies, but there’s no evidence the deal would actually raise drug prices for Americans. In any event, the place to bring up such concerns would be during open debate in Congress, where they could be addressed in the final deal, assuming Warren could get enough of her colleagues to share her tongue-in-cheek skepticism. The same logic is at work with Pelosi. She is stalling, refusing to set a date, and dodging questions about whether it protects workers and the environment — despite the fact the USMCA has the most robust labor and environmental protections of any major trade deal the United States has ever signed. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Like Warren, Pelosi’s opposition is just politics at its worst — and that’s saying something. If Pelosi really believes the protections are insufficient, then she and her allies should suggest modifications, or even pass USMCA and request that the U.S. trade representative work with our partners to improve the deal going forward. The only reason Democrats are dragging their feet on the USMCA is because they wish to deny Trump a hard-fought win as we approach an election year. That Machiavellian approach is not what America’s economy and workers need right now. We need to replace NAFTA, and the Democratic Party’s leadership is the only thing standing in the way.

"When approached by CNN at the United Nations in New York, Zelensky simply responded that his conversations with President Donald Trump are ""private and confidential."" When asked if he wanted  the transcript of the call to be released , Zelensky said, ""We'll see."" Zelensky is at the center of a political storm in the United States after reports that Trump pressured him to investigate Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of Ukrainian gas company that was under investigation by Ukraine's general prosecutor while Joe Biden was vice president. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  Trump on Sunday acknowledged the phone call and that he discussed Biden, but he has denied doing anything improper. Trump tweeted Tuesday he has ""authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine."" House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry  into Trump in the wake of his admissions about the call. Trump on Tuesday indicated that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had already received permission from Ukraine to release the transcript. ""Secretary of State Pompeo recieved permission from Ukraine Government to release the transcript of the telephone call I had with their President. They don't know either what the big deal is. A total Witch Hunt Scam by the Democrats!"" Trump tweeted. CNN confirmed Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before the call with Zelensky, two senior administration officials said on Monday. The Washington Post first reported the development. The call between Trump and Zelensky, which took place one day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, the source added. The Wall Street Journal was first to report Trump pressured Zelensky during the July phone call."
"There was a lot of drama. Senator Cory Booker, by way of greeting, lifted one of the moderators of Friday night’s  L.G.B.T.Q. Presidential Forum  right off the floor in a great bear hug. Later, an audience member interrupted Senator Amy Klobuchar with what sounded like an appeal to “protect sex workers.” And then there was Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who was asked what it would feel like to serve as president of a country for which he could not, under current regulations, donate his blood. But the most breathtaking moment, by my reckoning, belonged to Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said that she wasn’t just going to tell us what she’d do in her first 100 days. She would show us. And then she read aloud the names of the  18 transgender women of color  who have been murdered this year, in a voice that quavered with emotion. “It is time,” she concluded, “for a president of the United States of America to say their names.” Those names are Dana Martin, Jazzaline Ware, Ashanti Carmon, Claire Legato,  Muhlaysia Booker , Michelle Tamika Washington, Paris Cameron,  Chynal Lindsey , Chanel Scurlock, Zoe Spears, Brooklyn Lindsey, Denali Berries Stuckey, Kiki Fantroy, Pebbles LaDime “Dime” Doe, Tracy Single, Bailey Reeves, Bee Love Slater, and  Ja’leyah-Jamar . It was a historic night — the first time candidates for president have been brought together to discuss queer issues, in an event sponsored by  The Gazette , the  Advocate ,  One Iowa , and  GLAAD  (the L.G.B.T.Q. nonprofit which I served as national co-chair for four years). Cory Booker was the star of the first hour. After he bear-hugged  Zach Stafford , the editor of the Advocate, he gave a speech that was, for all its brevity, a barn burner. “You cannot lead the people,” he said, “if you do not love the people.” Meanwhile, as an older American — and one from Pennsylvania at that — I have a longtime affection for former Vice President Joe Biden, a fondness that has occasionally put me at odds with a younger generation of queer activists. I had hoped that Biden’s appearance at the forum would finally put to rest the uncertainty around his candidacy. That didn’t happen. Instead, — I’m so sorry to have to say this — he appeared, once again, to be  phoning it in . He said a few passionate but circuitous words as he stepped onto the stage, then looked over at the host, Lyz Lenz, an Iowa-based writer. “Do I go sit down?” he asked. She nodded. “Honestly, I thought you’d go a little longer.” Later, when she asked about Biden’s description of Mike Pence as “a decent guy,” he just looked at her and said, “You’re a lovely person.” Backstage, Lenz said, Biden had called her “sweetheart.” It may well be that this was, once again, just Joe being Joe. But — to put it mildly — he’s wearing me down. He has to do better. Pete Buttigieg had a good night; so did Julián Castro. Senator Kamala Harris did well enough, but I had hoped she’d show some of the grace and magic on display in the first debate. That didn’t happen, either. There were three losers of the forum, all Republicans: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, and the president himself. Many of the candidates took special note to lament the actions of the trio: DeVos, for  refusing to investigate complaints  by trans students in schools; Carson for his  horrific description  of trans women this week as “big hairy men;” and Donald Trump for pretty much everything: for the damage his administration has done to queer America, and for his passion, as abetted by Russian trolls, for pitting us against one another. Another loser last night was Senator Bernie Sanders, who did not show. There’s  a second forum  coming up in October, sponsored by U.C.L.A. and the Human Rights Campaign. Sanders isn’t going to that one, either. His campaign cites scheduling conflicts. Some of the other winners weren’t candidates. Angelica Ross, the chief moderator, was poised and fierce; you could make the case that she was more electrifying than any of people actually in the race. The sponsors of the event had a lot to celebrate as well, just for the fact of pulling this whole thing off. GLAAD’s chief executive,  Sarah Kate Ellis , provided a poised, articulate keynote as the evening began. As I listened to her, it occurred to me — and not for the first time — that I wouldn’t mind it one bit if she ran for president herself. Which is more than I can say about some people. But it was Warren and Booker who shone brightest. Warren, when asked about some Americans objecting to the morality of queer lives, responded with the parable in Matthew 25 about the sheep and the goats. “Whatever you have done for the least of my brothers and sisters,” she read, quoting Christ, “you did for me.” I would hope that this passage from Scripture gives Mike Pence something to think about. Booker, in making an appeal for a revival of civic grace, was nothing short of inspirational. Is this the moment he breaks out of the middle of the pack, and rises into the top tier? We’ll know soon enough. “What does love look like in public?” he asked. “It looks like justice.” The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters  to the editor.

"President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani on his conversation with Ukraine officials. Just hours after Rep.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y., said her party's failure so far to impeach President Trump  amounted to a major ""national scandal,""  House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi  appeared to relent on Sunday -- and warn that a ""whole new stage of investigation"" could be approaching. Pelosi, who has  long resisted calls to impeach Trump  because the move would  imperil the electability of moderate Democrats  in the House, outlined her new stance in a statement Sunday. Pelosi specifically said that a whistleblower who reportedly alleged that  Trump acted improperly  during a July 25 phone call with  Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy must be allowed to speak to Congress, and the full whistleblower complaint must be provided. Her aggressive push came as top Republicans, including California Rep. Devin Nunes, predicted that the gambit  would backfire for Democrats . Later in the evening, Trump sounded a similar note, saying the ""real story"" was that ""Sleepy Joe Biden"" had ""forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by the threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine."" The whistleblower drama escalated after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump repeatedly had asked Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son who had a key role in a natural gas firm that a Ukrainian prosecutor had been investigating as part of a corruption probe. At a conference two years after he left office, Joe Biden  openly bragged  about successfully pressuring Ukraine to  fire that prosecutor  when he was vice president. CNN  later reported the whistleblower had no direct knowledge of the call, and a top  Ukrainian  official on Saturday  defended Trump's  actions. Unverified reports  circulated on left-leaning media outlets  claiming that Trump could have promised something improper in exchange for Ukraine's compliance, although the Journal reported there was no ""quid-pro-quo"" involved. But if Democrats' demands were not met, Pelosi said, the Trump administration's ""grave new chapter of lawlessness"" would necessitate drastic action. ""We must be sure that the President and his Administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President’s personal or political interest,"" Pelosi said. FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED Speaking to CNN's ""State of the Union,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also said impeachment was on the table. Schiff previously has claimed to have  hard evidence  that the Trump team improperly colluded with Russia. “Why doesn’t the president just say, ‘Release the whistleblower complaint.’ Clearly he’s afraid for the public to see,” Schiff said. “This would be the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions.” “We may have crossed the Rubicon here,” he added, referring to the river that Julius Caesar fatefully traversed in 49 BC. “I have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment. ... but that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that that conduct represents.” The top Democrats' rhetoric came soon after Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday night kickstarted a  dormant, but long-simmering and occasionally explosive feud  with top House Democrats in the form of a fiery  tweet:  ""At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it."" Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a closed-door meeting in July, in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. That meeting came shortly before the departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti. Trump  acknowledged Sunday  that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned ""the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."" The president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call. GIULIANI CLARIFIES CONFUSING CNN COMMENTS ON UKRAINE Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, has long said publicly he  wanted Ukraine to look into the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine , and  admitted this week  that he's asked Ukraine to do so in the past -- but denied any impropriety or illegal conduct again on Sunday. ""This violation is about our national security,"" Pelosi said. ""The Inspector General determined that the matter is 'urgent' and therefore we face an emergency that must be addressed immediately."" Inspector General Michael Atkinson of the office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) wrote in a Sep. 9 letter to the House Intelligence Committee that the whistleblower complaint ""appeared credible"" and related to an ""urgent"" matter. But, the DNI general counsel said days later that, after consulting with the DOJ, the matter did not meet the legal definition of an ""urgent concern,"" and was not subject to mandatory disclosure to Congress. Trump's conversation came as the White House was holding up $250 million in military aid for Ukraine, money that the White House later released. The president has said he wanted European countries to pay more for their own defense, and  denied delaying any military aid funding. HOUSE INTEL RANKING REPUBLICAN: THIS IS THE END OF THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN ""Furthermore, because the complaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community, the DNI lacks unilateral authority to transmit such materials to the intelligence committees,"" Jason Klitenic, the DNI general counsel, wrote. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday. In her statement, Pelosi said Democrats would be watching closely. ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi said. ""Thank you for your patriotism."" Even some Republicans cautioned that the situation could be serious. Utah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney, a onetime Trump presidential rival,  tweeted  that ""If the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival,"" that ""would be troubling in the extreme."" At the same time, California  Rep. Devin Nunes  predicted on Fox News'  ""Sunday Morning Futures""  that  Biden's  campaign is likely coming to an end -- all because of the newly resurfaced reports about his  possible misconduct in Ukraine  that ""first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race."" The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee made the claim as  The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll  showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren  surging ahead of Biden  as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. Biden held a 9-point lead over Warren in the poll as recently as June. Indeed, the whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he  privately threatened then-President Petro Poroshenko  that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS THERE WAS NO PRESSURE ""I said, 'You're not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'"" ""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And, they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. And earlier this year, The Hill  reported  that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros. WATCH: POMPEO DEFENDS TRUMP AMID WHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGATION Then, in April, Ukrainian law enforcement officials said they had a  slew of evidence of collusion and wrongdoing by Democrats , and that they'd been trying to share this information with U.S. officials in the Justice Department. A  2017 investigation by Politico  found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory. Trump  told Fox News  that the allegations of possible Clinton-Ukraine collusion were ""big"" and vowed the DOJ would review them. ""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better."" ""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who claimed Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy. Meanwhile, Biden on Saturday denied he has ever spoken to Hunter about his business in Ukraine and called Trump's actions an ""overwhelming abuse of power."" WATCH: LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS NO ONE HAS REALLY LOOKED INTO BIDENS AND THEIR DEALINGS IN UKRAINE ""Trump’s doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum, and he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" Biden  told reporters in Iowa . Trump, on Sunday, pointed out that Biden's claim was seemingly inaccurate. Hunter Biden told the  New Yorker  previously that he and his father had spoken ""just once"" about it. ""And now, he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,"" Trump said. ""Of course you spoke to your son!"" Trump added: ""No quid pro quo, there was nothing. It was a perfect conversation. ... The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine, and Ukraine has got a lot of problems. The new president is saying that he's going to be able to rid the country of corruption and I said that would be a great thing, we had a great conversation."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump went on to say the latest allegations are ""just as ridiculous as the others,"" branding it ""the Ukraine Witch Hunt"" — a nod to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. ""Will fail again!"" Trump tweeted. Fox News' Ronn Blitzer, Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

THE SHADOW OF CORRUPTION How corrupt do you think your government is? 
According to Transparency International, which has been ranking countries on its 1-100 scale for 25 years, the United States is not very corrupt at all. 
The  most recent rankings , built through a survey of experts and businesspeople, ranks the U.S. as 22nd cleanest in the 180 nations of the world. We run in a pack with other mostly Western liberal democracies like Australia, Britain and France just behind the squeaky clean Scandinavian nations and, of course, Canada. 
We are far removed from the rampant corruption under which most of the rest of the world is forced to live. Russia, China, India and Brazil are all bad news when it comes to basic principles of fairness. All of Africa except for Botswana and every Asian nation except Japan are considered substantially corrupt.   
So your government, on an empirical basis, is pretty much on the level. 
But that’s not the important question. What matters is how corrupt do you  think  your government is. And on that score, the news is bad. 
In our most recent Fox News  poll , we asked respondents “How many people in the government do you think are corrupt -- almost all, many, some, or almost none?” The results should be sobering for everyone concerned about the current trajectory of politics. 
About one in five said that almost all of the people in government are corrupt. An amazing 43 percent said that “many” are crooked. Just 31 percent got closer to reality saying that “some” in the government are corrupt. A sad 2 percent said “almost none.” 
As with all reputational goods, like a nation’s currency, the perception of value is far more important than the actual value itself. If a government is perceived as corrupt it’s almost as bad as the real thing, and will eventually result in real corruption anyway. 
If you think the game is rigged, you’re far more likely to be willing to cheat yourself. 
The 64 percent of Americans who believe their government is rotten with corruption don’t belong to any particular demographic or political group, either. Women are a little more distrustful than men and white people are more dubious than other ethnic groups, whites without college degrees most of all. 
But religious faith, political proclivities, education and income all had relatively little bearing on the overall perception that corruption is a major problem in our government. 
It’s no wonder, given what both political parties are selling these days. It would be one thing if the response was really about “draining the swamp” and some sustained effort for reforms that might bring public perception back into alignment with reality. But what tends to happen is that politicians exploit such perceptions to create lower expectations for good government and accountability once they are in power. 
If the whole system is rigged, why should our side have to play by the rules? After all  they’re  the real crooks  
That’s how the false perception of rampant corruption makes way for the real thing. THE RULEBOOK: THERE’S A DIFFERENCE 
“It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.” –  James Madison ,  Federalist No. 14 TIME OUT: SOUNDS LIKE AMERICA Gun&Garden:  “When  Ken Burns  decides to cover a topic, set aside some time to dig in. Best known for his epics, including his  Civil War  documentary, which aired on PBS over five nights in 1990 to an audience of 40 million people, the filmmaker is now readying for the premiere his latest deep-dive,  Country Music . The eight-part, sixteen-hour film takes a magnifying glass to the forces that shaped this distinctly American sound. ‘I’m looking for stories, and I’m looking for stories that are firing on all cylinders,’ Burns tells  Garden & Gun . … The film runs chronologically, tracing the many influences that shaped country music, from enslaved people bringing the banjo across the Atlantic from Africa all the way to the heyday of pop-country in the mid-1990s. The genre, Burns reveals, is less a set of rules and boundaries than it is a spectrum—one that trades on universal truths and bridges cultural, racial, and economic divides.” Flag on the play? -  Email us at  HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM  with your tips, comments or questions.

BIDEN RACKS UP KEY ENDORSEMENTS AP:  “ Joe Biden  sought to demonstrate a broad appeal to Democrats on Thursday with new endorsements from leading African American lawmakers and a former governor of a pivotal swing state. The backing from Reps.  G.K. Butterfield  of North Carolina,  Emanuel Cleaver  of Missouri and  Charlie Crist  of Florida reflects Biden’s play both for the party establishment and for minority voters who are critical in the early stages of the primary. Butterfield and Cleaver are former chairmen of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Crist was the governor of Florida before he entered Congress. The moves are the latest example of Biden’s durability as an early Democratic front-runner. So far, he’s successfully threaded different wings of the party despite skepticism from progressives and questions about whether, at 76, he’s too old for the presidency. … [T]he support of Butterfield and Cleaver in particular is a potential blow to Sen.  Kamala Harris  [and] Sen.  Cory Booker …” Younger black voters try to pry their parents from Biden -  NYT:  “If Mr. Biden, 76, is going to win the Democratic nomination, it is likely to be because of the support of older black voters… But if he is to be overtaken by one of his more progressive rivals, the most powerful tool against him may not be opposition research or negative advertisements. Instead, it may be an organic effort by younger black voters — concerned about Mr. Biden’s age and more moderate ideology — to sway their older family members. Mr. Biden seems aware of this dynamic. In interviews, he has both acknowledged the generational gap among his black supporters and downplayed its importance, arguing that the support of older, more moderate black voters would be enough to give him an electoral advantage. Still, Mr. Biden, by his own admission, would be unwise to underestimate the lobbying efforts of those who are young and politically engaged.” Harris takes aim at Warren -  WSJ:  “Ka­mala Har­ris, now a dis­tant fourth in the De­mo­c­ra­tic pres­i­den­tial race, took aim at poll-climber  Eliz­a­beth War­ren  for do­ing big-money events. In re­sponse to a ques­tion about War­ren, Har­ris said at a closed-door fundraiser it was hyp­o­crit­i­cal for her ri­val to claim she wasn’t tak­ing money from large donors when War­ren trans­ferred around $10 mil­lion from her Sen­ate funds be­fore de­nounc­ing big money do­na­tions. Har­ris moved $1.2 mil­lion into her pres­i­den­tial fund. Har­ris lamented that she now needs to be in places like New York to keep the cam­paign fi­nan­cially afloat but prefers to spend time in early vot­ing states. On a later press call, Har­ris’s cam­paign didn’t name War­ren di­rectly but noted re­peat­edly that Har­ris came into the cam­paign with less than other can­di­dates be­cause ‘we spent 2018 rais­ing for other can­di­dates.’” And same with Buttigieg -   AP:  “Democratic presidential candidate  Pete Buttigieg  is accusing his 2020 rival Elizabeth Warren of being ‘extremely evasive’ when it comes to explaining how she'd finance a universal health care plan. Speaking on CNN on Thursday, Buttigieg issued his most pointed attack yet on the Massachusetts senator, saying she ‘was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we've seen that repeatedly.’ The sharpened critique comes as the fall campaign kicks into high gear with Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses scheduled in February. Warren has assembled a well-organized campaign there and leads Buttigieg in Iowa, where the South Bend, Indiana, mayor's longshot presidential campaign is competing heavily and trying to break through.” Yang plays Perot for a new generation -   Atlantic:  “To understand why [ Andrew Yang  is hanging on in the polls], it’s worth looking at how he responded earlier this month when  Shane Gillis , a comedian for Saturday Night Live, referred to him using a racial slur. Yang urged that Gillis not be fired. … But more revealing was Yang’s explanation for why Gillis deserved forgiveness. Gillis, Yang tweeted, ‘does not strike me as malignant or evil. He strikes me as a still-forming comedian from central Pennsylvania.’ What does central Pennsylvania have to do with it? For Andrew Yang and his supporters, everything. It’s code for economic distress—which Yang believes fuels racism and most of the other problems that menace America. … Over the past quarter century, two presidential candidates have mobilized these economics-first, culture-war-indifferent voters into a potent force. The first was  Ross Perot . The second is Andrew Yang.” De Blasiout -   Fox News:  “New York Mayor  Bill de Blasio  announced Friday he is dropping out of the 2020 Democratic primary, ending his campaign after struggling to gain traction in the race. ‘I feel like I contributed all I can to this primary election and it’s clearly not my time,’ he said during an appearance on MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe.’ ‘So I’m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City and I’m going to keep speaking up for working people.’ De Blasio entered the presidential race in May, running as a proud progressive. But his campaign never caught fire: He qualified for the first two rounds of Democratic presidential debates but has failed to make the cut for the others.” Booker hides from past alliance with DeVos -   WaPo:  “Cory Booker was a little-known member of the Newark City Council 19 years ago when he received an extraordinary invitation from a Michigan group connected to  Betsy DeVos , now the U.S. Secretary of Education. DeVos and her husband,  Dick , were leading Republican proponents of a state ballot initiative that would allow taxpayer-financed vouchers to pay for private schools. … Booker accepted. … But as Booker runs for president, his relationship with DeVos, his previous support of vouchers and his continuing praise for charter schools present potential roadblocks. Vouchers and charters schools are anathema to many powerful teachers unions, who have outsize power in Democratic primaries, and some candidates in the party strongly oppose them on the grounds that they weaken traditional public schools.” UKRAINE AT CENTER OF FIGHT OVER ALLEGED TRUMP PROMISE Fox News:  “The developing controversy over a mysterious phone conversation  President Trump  had with a foreign leader apparently centers on Ukraine, as the president and his allies fight back and claim the uproar is just another ‘partisan’ plot against him. What touched off the controversy is a secret whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ‘promise’ Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. Trump's attorney,  Rudy Giuliani , seemed to acknowledge some effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate potential corruption related to the Biden family, though he gave conflicting answers on the matter in a CNN interview overnight. It remains unclear what the supposed ‘promise’ from Trump entailed. The president, however, maintained he said nothing improper, tearing into those pushing the allegations Friday.” Giuliani inconsistent -  WaPo:  “Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, contradicted himself when asked whether he personally asked Ukraine to investigate former vice president  Joe Biden , ranted about media bias and defended Trump amid new reports about an intelligence official’s whistleblower complaint, during a chaotic and fiery CNN interview Thursday night. Immediately after anchor  Chris Cuomo  introduced him and summarized the latest news out of the whistleblower story, which had only broken about an hour prior, Giuliani went into attack mode. … Giuliani spent the first half of the interview repeating the claim that Biden in 2016 pressured Ukraine to drop its top prosecutor, which at the time was also investigating a natural gas company where Biden’s son  Hunter  was on the board. …There’s been no evidence found that Biden was trying to help out his son.” TRUMP RALLIES WITH MODI IN OUTREACH TO KEY VOTER BLOC WaPo:  “President Trump heads to Harris County, Texas this weekend to a major rally ahead of next week's United Nations General Assembly — for Indian Prime Minister  Narendra Modi . The website for the ‘Howdy, Modi’ rally boasts that the ‘live audience will be the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader visiting the United States other than the Pope’: Some 50,000 people, many from Houston's large Indian diaspora, are expected to turn out. It's eye-popping that leaders of the world's two biggest democracies are appearing together at such an event — let alone that this particular American president will be holding court in the epicenter of Texas's blue wave and the most diverse city in America. You're not wrong if you think that doesn't sound like friendly territory for Trump. But that's a strong political reason for him to go: Democrats are making a big play for Texas in 2020 and Republicans are growing concerned. The rally for Modi, who is hugely popular in India, provides Trump with access to a potential pool of Indian American voters that could turn out to be critical in next year's presidential elections.” SENATE DEMS NEED BIG WINS IN THE SUN BELT Politico:  “To take back the White House, Democrats only need to win back three key Rust Belt states. But if they want to move a president’s agenda through the Senate, they have to flip the Sun Belt. From Arizona to North Carolina to a pair of seats in Georgia, Democrats have to clean up in that stretch of the country to have any chance of taking the chamber. President Donald Trump carried each of those states in 2016, and in an era of polarized politics when Senate races are increasingly nationalized, Democrats need at least strong performances by the party's presidential nominee in the Sun Belt states — if not victories — to have a shot at flipping their Senate seats. So while some Democrats are laser-focused on winning back the Rust Belt, Democrats across the Southern half of the country are urging their party to invest heavily in their states — not just as a way to flip the Senate, but as part of the path to 270 Electoral College votes.” Kemp frustrates GOP with cattle call for Senate appointment -   AJC:  “Within hours of Gov.  Brian Kemp ’s unusual decision to invite the public to apply to succeed U.S. Sen.  Johnny Isakson , his office was blitzed with resumes — some serious and some silly — from wannabe Washingtonians.Lawyers. Doctors. Local government officials. Serial jokesters. IT specialists. A well-known pundit. As of Wednesday evening, 158 people had applied — and many, many more are expected to join in. … Welcome to the next phase of the race for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Chances are, Kemp and his advisers already have whittled a list of top contenders for Isakson’s seat down to a handful — and that the online application process unveiled late Tuesday will be largely for show. But encouraging would-be U.S. senators to publicly declare their ambition might just expand the scope of his search even as it forces some tough decisions on potential contenders.” PLAY-BY-PLAY Fox Poll: Voters are frustrated with government, nervous about economy   -  Fox News Trump files lawsuit in bid to protect personal, corporate tax returns from release  -  Fox News McConnell flips stance, announces support for $250 million in election security funding  -  WaPo Sanders becomes first Dem candidate to hit one million donors  -  Politico AUDIBLE: IOWA NICE?

"But on Tuesday afternoon, Sanders took it even a step farther. In a tweet touting his newly unveiled plan to tax the ultra-wealthy, the Vermont senator wrote this: ""There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people."" No billionaires! As in, Sanders is going to tax them out of existence? That's not, at least according to my reading of the plan, what Sanders is actually proposing. Here's the basics of his ultra-wealth tax,  according to his website : ""It would start with a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million for a married couple. That means a married couple with $32.5 million would pay a wealth tax of just $5,000. ""The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. These brackets are halved for singles. ""Under this plan, the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over 15 years which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small privileged class."" So, Sanders' plan would significantly reduce the number of billionaires. It would not get rid of billionaires entirely. Except that, at least according to the tweet, the elimination of all billionaires is the end goal of Sanders' plan. Which is a political problem for Sanders. ""Wait, what??""  tweeted Andy Lassner , an executive producer of ""Ellen"" and a prominent liberal voice on Twitter, in response to Sanders' tweet. ""So folks like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet who have committed their vast wealth to providing clean water around the world and obliterating Polio shouldn't exist? Oprah shouldn't exist?"" If that is the reaction from the liberal left, can you imagine what President Donald Trump and his allies will do with a line like, ""There should be no billionaires?"" Trump, even at the United Nations on Tuesday, made his oft-repeated pledge that ""America will never be a socialist country."" Polling suggests that most Americans view billionaires suspiciously --  a Bloomberg poll showed just 31% said they admired billionaires  -- but there is  very little support for seeking to eliminate billionaires entirely or a large number of people who view the existence of billionaires as a policy failure by this country . Sanders' lean-in to this sort of treatment of the wealthy provides a real contrast not just to the likes of former Vice President Joe Biden but also to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who  has proposed her own tax on the extremely wealthy . ""I am a capitalist,""  she told CNBC's John Harwood in 2018 . ""Come on. I believe in markets."" Make no mistake: There is a segment within the Democratic primary who will love the idea of taxing billionaires into oblivion. But almost all of those people are already for Sanders. For everyone else in the party, they will likely see this for what it will be in the context of a general election in which Sanders is the nominee: The reddest of red meat for Donald Trump."

"""It is time for this administration stop stonewalling and provide the Congress with all the facts it needs, including a copy of the formal  complaint made by the whistleblower . And it's time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this President,"" Biden said. The Democratic presidential candidate said if Trump ""does not comply with such a request from the Congress, if he continues to obstruct Congress, and flout the law, Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment.""  ""That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making,"" he said, speaking from Wilmington, Delaware.   Biden's comments on Tuesday were the most direct statement he has made on impeachment. But by making his call for Trump's removal conditional, he stopped short of some of his Democratic rivals, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who are calling for the House to impeach Trump now. ""I can take the political attacks,"" Biden said. ""They'll come and they'll go, and in time they'll soon be forgotten, but if we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution, that will last forever."" ""Denying Congress the information, which it is constitutionally entitled to, and obstructing its efforts to investigate actions is not the conduct of an American President,"" Biden said. ""It's an abuse of power.""  Biden said when he announced his candidacy he believed the ""core values of this nation, our very democracy, was at risk."" He said ""events in recent days have made that even clearer."" Trump is facing intense criticism over a July phone call during which, according to a person familiar with the matter,  he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden's son, Hunter . There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump on Sunday acknowledged the phone call and that he discussed Biden, but denied doing anything improper.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to announce a formal impeachment inquiry later Tuesday, multiple sources on Capitol Hill tell CNN. Trump  tweeted Tuesday  he has ""authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine."" CNN confirmed Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before a call with Zelensky, two senior administration officials said on Monday. The Washington Post first reported this. The call between Trump and Zelensky , which took place one day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was also part of a  whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General , the source added.  The Wall Street Journal  was first to report Trump pressured Zelensky during the July phone call.  Trump admitted Tuesday he delayed aid to Ukraine  ahead of the call to Zelensky, giving the excuse that he was waiting for European nations to contribute their fair share of aid. The Washington Post first reported  Monday Trump had directed his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million of US military and security aid to Ukraine in the days before he spoke with Zelensky. This story is breaking and will be updated. "
"Speaker Pelosi to hold meeting of full caucus to consider steps to advance impeachment; Mike Emanuel reports from Capitol Hill. Ahead of an expected announcement of an official impeachment inquiry,  House Speaker Nancy Pelois, D-Calif.,  revealed her emotional state ahead of the potentially massive move. Speaking at The Atlantic Festival on Tuesday, Pelosi said it is: ""sad to think that a president would perform an impeachable offense. It's hard. it's hard to say that we've gotten to that place but what would be [an] impeachable offense would be that which is proven in an investigation."" The Constitution grants the House of Representatives the power to investigate impeachable conduct while the Senate maintains authority for ultimately removing the president from office. Fox News has confirmed that Pelosi will announce the probe at 5 p.m. ET. During the event, which was held prior to the expected announcement, Pelosi indicated she would be backing official impeachment proceedings, arguing that she would need an official investigation to determine whether  the president  engaged in ""impeachable"" conduct. PELOSI FACING GROUNDSWELL OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT CALLS INSIDE CAUCUS OVER UKRAINE FUROR Tuesday's developments come after Pelosi repeatedly resisted calls for impeachment for much of 2019, after new evidence surfaced in the Russia investigation. However, her expected change of heart came after it was reported the president pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, tweeting that he would release the full unredacted transcript of their phone conversation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!"" he  said. Pelosi, during Tuesday's event, also claimed Trump was ""making lawlessness a virtue in our country"" and tried to ""exploit"" his power with Ukraine.

"Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano joins Shepard Smith on 'Shepard Smith Reporting.' Judge Andrew Napolitano  told  Fox News host Shepard Smith  on Tuesday that the president effectively confessed to a crime when he admitted he asked  Ukraine  to investigate  former Vice President Joe Biden  and his son, Hunter. Napolitano, a Fox News senior judicial analyst, had framed President Trump's earlier statement as an admission that he tried to ""solicit aid for his campaign from a foreign government."" “So that to which the president has admitted is in and of itself a crime,” Smith followed. Napolitano responded, ""yes,"" and claimed it was the same crime former  Special Counsel Robert Mueller  investigated as part of the long-running  Russia investigation . Napolitano's comments came amid renewed calls for impeachment and just before  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , announced the formalization of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump on Tuesday. Pelosi said ""the president must be held accountable"" for his ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections."" TRUMP'S UKRAINE CONTROVERSY CAST SPOTLIGHT ON HUNTER BIDEN'S BUSINESS DEALINGS ""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella. ""The president must be held accountable,"" she continued. ""No one is above the law."" The move toward impeachment proceedings gained momentum after a whistleblower's allegation that the president pressed Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky  during a July phone call to  investigate  Biden and his son Hunter. Biden  has acknowledged  that when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm  Burisma Holdings  — where Hunter Biden was on the board. He has also denied any wrongdoing, and Shokin was widely criticized for allegedly being too soft on corruption. In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the aid money to Ukraine's investigative actions. “No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine  a ""disgrace,""  and added: “It’s very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?” On ""Shephard Smith Reporting,"" Napolitano indicated that the president's attorney,  Rudy Giuliani , could have committed a crime if he  urged Ukraine  to investigate Biden in a bid to help the president's reelection efforts. Giuliani previously said that he directed Ukraine to investigate Biden but not as part of an effort to help Trump win reelection. The reality is, the distinction is this: What they’re saying is, I went there for, on a political mission, to kind of get Joe Biden in trouble. Ridiculous. I went there as a lawyer defending his client,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

"Michael Knowles says the Biden campaign does not benefit from news surrounding his son’s overseas business with the Ukraine. Utah Sen.  Mitt Romney , who has recently said he may decline to support  President Trump ’s reelection bid, tweeted on Sunday that it would be ‘troubling in the extreme’ if the president appealed to his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Romney, in a tweet on Sunday, said it was ""critical for the facts to come out.” Trump called his conversations with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy “perfectly fine and routine."" “Nothing was said that was in any way wrong,”  Trump said. Trump has been reportedly accused of pressuring Zelenskiy to work with his  personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, in investigating Hunter Biden, and using military aid as leverage.  Trump denied making any improper requests, but he did point fingers at the Bidens and their relationship with Ukraine. The Democratic presidential hopeful’s son Hunter Biden had been investigated related to business interests.  Biden has said in the past that the  U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden’s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. Biden told reporters in Iowa on Saturday that “Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader trying to intimidate a foreign leader, if that’s what happened.” GET THE FOX NEWS APP He accused Trump of “doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.” Trump accused Biden of dishonesty in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling the  New Yorker  that they spoke “just once” about it.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Saturday dismissed news reports that he  urged the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son  as little more than a “witch hunt” and said his dealings were “perfectly fine” and routine. “Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He said that any effort to investigate him would fail, comparing it to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into his ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign. The news reports he was referring to have revealed the existence of a secret whistle-blower complaint that is believed to have been filed, at least partly, in response to Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The New York Times  reported  Friday that Mr. Trump, in a July call, pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Biden’s son, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Mr. Trump, intensifying a line of attack he and his allies have stoked for months, said the real problem was Mr. Biden, who according to most polls is the leading candidate in a crowded Democratic field and has framed himself as the most likely to defeat Mr. Trump in the general election. “The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,” Mr. Trump wrote, “so they fabricate a story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine.” No evidence  has surfaced to bolster Mr. Trump’s claim that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor general’s dismissal. Another tweet from Mr. Trump , which featured his campaign’s phone number, included a series of video clips featuring journalists, including some from The New York Times, discussing Mr. Biden and Ukraine on television news programs. Citing the reports by journalists seemed ironic given the president’s claim that the media had not reported on Mr. Biden. But the tweets signaled that Mr. Trump and his campaign organization would be doing as much as possible to sow doubt about Mr. Biden. Friday’s reports on the president drew strong reactions from top Democrats and, for some, brought a new urgency to calls for Mr. Trump’s impeachment. “There is no bottom. Impeach him,” Beto O’Rourke said on Friday evening. And Joe Walsh, a former congressman from Illinois who has launched a long-shot challenge to Mr. Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, urged others in his party who were alarmed by the president’s behavior to come forward. “He doesn’t believe in the rule of law,” Mr. Walsh wrote on Twitter on Saturday morning. “He abuses his power whenever he wants. He lies at will. He doesn’t know the meaning of checks & balances. And he sees nothing wrong with telling a foreign government to dig up dirt on his opponents. Come on Republicans. Be better than this.” Although Mr. Mueller wrote in his report that he found “insufficient evidence” to accuse the president or his advisers of a criminal conspiracy with the Russians, his investigators said his campaign welcomed Moscow’s intereference and expected to benefit from it. Democrats are using Mr. Mueller’s findings as part of the basis for their impeachment inquiry. Mr. Biden, for his part, has dismissed the president’s attacks. “If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country,” he said in a statement released after The Times and other new organizations, including The Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, reported Mr. Trump’s conversations with Mr. Zelensky. “This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes.” For years,  the Bidens have faced questions  about the association of Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, with one of Ukraine’s largest natural gas companies, and whether or not there was any connection to Mr. Biden’s efforts as vice president to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor whose office had authority over investigations of the oligarch whose company paid his son. Mr. Biden’s son earned as much as $50,000 per month in some months for his work for the company, Burisma Holdings. This year, the current Ukrainian prosecutor general reopened an investigation into Burisma just as Mr. Biden began  his 2020 presidential campaign ."
"Trump addresses reporters as he arrives at the United Nations, says 'what Biden did was wrong.' Former Massachusetts Gov.  Bill Weld , who is challenging  President Trump  in the Republican primaries, proclaimed Monday that the president committed treason through his  controversial phone call  to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- adding that the punishment for treason is death. The statement drew a swift rebuke from the Trump campaign. “The media’s affliction with Trump Derangement Syndrome has driven them into an actual discussion of the proposed execution of the President of the United States,” communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News. “In severe cases of TDS such as this, immediate consultation with a physician is recommended.” LONG-SHOT GOP PRIMARY CHALLENGERS TO HAVE THEIR OWN DEBATE THIS MONTH -- MINUS TRUMP Weld was responding to claims that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden -- the son of former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden -- and threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine as leverage. Trump  has denied  wrongdoing. “Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election, it couldn’t be clearer. And that’s not just undermining democratic institutions, that is treason,"" Weld said on  MSNBC 's ""Morning Joe."" ""It’s treason pure and simple. And the penalty for treason under the U.S. Code is death. That’s the only penalty.” Weld then referred to impeachment as a possible alternative to a criminal case, stating, “The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office, and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal.” Weld’s mention of the death penalty later ignited a conversation about the “legal framework” of the claim. Weld again said, “The only penalty for treason is death, it’s spelled out in the statute.” While the U.S. Code does list the death penalty as a punishment for treason, Weld’s claim that it is the only penalty is false. Treason is covered by  18. U.S. Code § 2381 , which says that a person guilty of treason “shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.” When Fox News asked Weld’s campaign about this, they did not immediately respond. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Weld's comments came during a joint television appearance with the two other longshot Republicans challenging Trump in next year's primary: former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh. They have joined together to protest the canceling of GOP presidential primaries in some states in 2020."
"Is that more in line with America's values? Fox News contributor Jonathan Morris weighs in. ""The View""  co-host Abby Huntsman took her colleague  Joy Behar  to task Tuesday after the latter tried guilt-tripping people into supporting action on  climate change. Behar started the debate by claiming that people who denied climate change didn't care about their grandchildren. ""Some of these people who are denying climate change — they're going to be dead and they don't care apparently about their grandchildren. They only care about their 401k's,"" Behar argued. For Huntsman, Behar's statement went too far. She argued that it wasn't ""fair to say that they don't care about their own grandkids."" ""That's what it looks like to me,"" Behar shot back. She later indicated she would continue ""guilt-tripping"" people over the issue. 'THE VIEW' CO-HOST DERIDES BERNIE SANDERS' DEBATE SHOWING: 'LOOKED LIKE HE CRAWLED OUT OF A GARBAGE CAN' ""Guilt-tripping might work,"" she said, before standing behind her previous statement about grandchildren. Huntsman contended that Behar was discouraging ""rational conversation"" by taking a shot at people's relationships with their grandchildren. Their comments came as  climate activists held demonstrations  in major cities over the issue and the United Nations held a ""climate summit"" with world leaders.

Just stop having all kids. Let's just think about not having kids anymore?'"" Huntsman asked. She pointed to comments from  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,  who has worried about whether she should have kids and warned that  Miami would be gone  within a few years."
"National security attorney Bradley Moss and attorney Harmeet Dhillon weigh in on the whistleblower complaint. A guest on  MSNBC  offered a warning to Democratic lawmakers on Monday night that if they don't pursue impeachment against  President Trump  that they will lose in 2020. Richard Painter, the former White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, began by claiming there was ""no evidence"" that  former Vice President Joe Biden  and his son Hunter Biden, were involved with corruption in Ukraine, as Trump has alleged. But when asked about Trump's ""attempted collusion"" with Ukraine, Painter declared it was an ""impeachable offense."" “This is an impeachable offense, turning the powers of a foreign government against a candidate in the United States who is a political rival of Donald Trump, this in and of itself is impeachable,”  Painter said . “This president has committed multiple high crimes and misdemeanors and what is happening when the House refuses to impeach him, he continues to do more and more of it.” REP. AL GREEN WARNS DEMS: 'THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO TURN ON US' IF WE DON'T IMPEACH TRUMP Painter went on to say that Trump ""feels emboldened"" as House Democrats remain stagnant on impeachment and gave a grim forecast for the Democratic Party if they don't take action. “As Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi doesn’t have the courage to impeach him, he’s going to keep on doing it. He is getting a pass from this Congress,"" Painter continued. ""It’s critically important that the House not only start impeachment investigations formally but that they vote out articles of impeachment, all of the evidence is already there. We don’t need more to impeach this president and if they don’t do it, I think the Democrats are going to lose in 2020, and probably deserve to lose.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The debate among Democrats over Trump's impeachment was revived last week after it was reported that a whistleblower from the intelligence community flagged what was being described as a ""troubling"" interaction the president had with a foreign leader. It was later reported that Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into Biden's son and the president has since been accused of leveraging financial aid to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on the 2020 Democratic frontrunner."
"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's connection to Ukraine is the 'least best-kept secret in Washington,' says California Congressman Devin Nunes, Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee. A House Democrat said Monday it's time for  2020 presidential  hopeful  Joe Biden  to ""clear up"" the questions surrounding his son's  Ukrainian  business dealings. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, appeared on CNN and responded to a clip of  Fox News' Peter Doocy  asking Biden if he had ever spoken to his son, Hunter, about his foreign business affairs. Hunter has been tied to a natural gas firm in Ukraine that was involved in a corruption probe. Biden said he had never spoken with his son about such matters. But according to a  New Yorker  report in July, Hunter Biden said he had discussed his business in Ukraine with his father. ""Well, clearly something needs to be cleared up at this point,"" Gonzalez replied. ""So, yes, of course, I would want an explanation on that."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo weighed in on Biden's Ukranian ties during a ""Fox News Sunday"" interview and even mentioned the possibility of the Democratic front-runner being involved in an election scandal. UKRAINE PHONE CALL SCANDAL IS MEDIA STRIKING BACK AFTER FAILED RUSSIA HOAX, SAYS DAN BONGINO ""I do hope that if Vice President Biden engaged in behavior that was inappropriate -- if he had a conflict of interest, or allowed something to take place in Ukraine which may have interfered in our elections in 2016, I do hope that we get to the bottom of that,"" said Pompeo. There is also talk of Biden's campaign facing irreparable damage, with  Rep. Devin Nunes , R-Calif., suggesting his bid for the White House could end due to the controversy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""These stories first originated back when  Hillary Clinton  was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race,"" Nunes said on  ""Sunday Morning Futures""  this week.

We want to hear from that whistleblower, but it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And, like I said, it looks like this is the end of Biden’s campaign. I really do... his lead is basically down to zero."" Fox News Gregg Re contributed to this report"
"Dr. Marc Siegel weighs in on 2020 Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders' health care plan. It may be a winning ticket in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, but two new polls indicate "" Medicare-for-all "" is far from the right prescription in the general election race for the White House. Nearly two-thirds of Democratic primary voters questioned in a  new NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll  say they support a government-run single-payer Medicare-for-all style system that would replace existing private insurance. That plan is championed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the two progressive standard-bearers in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls. WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SAYS ABOUT MEDICARE BUY-INS AND MEDICARE FOR ALL But among all voters, support for such a plan plunges to just 41 percent. About 56 percent of registered voters oppose a ""Medicare-for-all"" plan that replaces private insurance. The poll, released Sunday, indicates that what two-thirds of all voters do like is allowing  a Medicare buy-in  for those under 65 years old. That’s in line with the public option being pitched by former Vice President Joe Biden. Currently, the taxpayer-funded program covers Americans 65 and older. The latest Fox News national poll  also points to the popularity of the Medicare buy-in plan, with 83 percent of Democratic primary voters saying they favor the plan, which would allow individuals to buy into the government-run system. Even 51 percent of Republicans agree.  Among all voters, 68 percent support a buy-in system. But support for a ""Medicare-for-all"" plan that replaces private insurance nosedives to 46 percent among all voters in the Fox News poll, which was released last week. Sen. Kamala Harris of California also supports Medicare-for-all, albeit with a role for private insurers. Health care has been a leading concern among Democratic primary voters, with the issue topping the past two primary debates. READ THE FULL RESULTS OF THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL The NBC/WSJ poll  was conducted Sept. 13-16, with 900 registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling error is 3.27 percentage points for all registered voters and 4.36 percentage points for Democratic primary voters. The Fox News Poll  was conducted Sept. 15-17, with 1,008 registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling error is 3 percentage points for all registered voters and 4.5 percentage points for Democratic primary voters."
"Democrats are going through 'Russia Fantasy Part II,' says John Sununu, former White House chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush. Former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu said on Monday that the  Ukraine  phone call scandal involving  President Trump  is just a repeat of how the Democrats' Russian collusion narrative unfolded. “It’s just a repeat, it’s a rerun, it’s a sequel to what they did with Russia,” Sununu told  “America’s Newsroom.” Trump was accused of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy into investigating  Joe Biden  and his son, Hunter, for their ties to a natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, which was being investigated as part of a corruption case. This prompted Democratic lawmakers to call for the release of the entire transcript of the phone call in question. UKRAINE PHONE CALL SCANDAL IS MEDIA STRIKING BACK AFTER FAILED RUSSIA HOAX, SAYS DAN BONGINO “[Democratic California House Rep. Adam] Schiff goes out, makes an outrageous statement, as he did with the Russia claims, and the Mueller report just made it clear that all those claims that came out of Schiff were pure unadulterated lies,” said Sununu, who served as White House chief of staff under President George H. W. Bush. SARAH SANDERS: MEDIA 'HAS EGG ON THEIR FACE' FROM FAILING TO MAKE RUSSIA COLLUSION NARRATIVE STICK Sununu said that the Trump administration should release the entire transcript as he is aware that it would draw concern. “If I were the White House, I would try and release as much as the transcript of the conversation as possible,” he said. He said that if the transcript were to be disclosed, foreign leaders will not speak frankly with the president in fear that the intelligence community in the U.S. can't keep secrets. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sununu went on to say, “This has got a long way to go. A lot of information will come out. The Dems will do what they did. The press will do what they did.

"Under fire, Trump has revived one of his favorite defensive tactics: trying to turn the spotlight onto his opponent.  Trump has made a series of allegations about Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden over the last week. The essence of Trump's argument is that Joe Biden was improperly trying to help Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, when Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire the country's prosecutor general.  But there are significant holes in Trump's story. Some of his allegations have been false. Others have been missing important context. Trump's missing context: What happened with the Ukrainian prosecutor In castigating Biden's effort to get the prosecutor general fired, Trump has declined to mention an important fact: a whole lot of other people were also trying to get him fired at the time. The Obama administration, American allies, the International Monetary Fund and  Ukrainian anti-corruption activists , among others, had all made clear that they were displeased with the performance of Viktor Shokin, who became prosecutor general in 2015.  Shokin was widely faulted for  declining to bring prosecutions of elites' corruption , and he was even  accused of hindering corruption investigations . His deputy, Vitaliy Kasko, resigned in February 2016,  alleging  that Shokin's office was itself corrupt.  The International Monetary Fund warned Ukraine in February 2016 that it risked losing financial support if it did not clean up its act. The Financial Times explained in its article on the warning that then-President Petro Poroshenko was facing pressure to replace Shokin, whom the newspaper described as a ""long-time loyalist"" of the president; the  article  continued, ""Mr. Shokin has been criticized for failing to bring to justice any of the snipers who killed dozens of protesters in central Kiev in the final days of the revolution, and for dragging his feet over investigating senior officials and businesspeople.""  In a September 2015 speech, the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, used blunt language in criticizing Shokin,  blasting  ""corrupt actors within the Prosecutor General's Office"" who were ""making things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform."" Then, during a visit to Ukraine, Biden, who had  long handled Ukraine issues for the Obama administration , applied public and private pressure on the government.  In a speech to Ukraine's legislature, Biden  said , ""The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform.""  The most detailed account of Biden's private words comes from Biden himself. At a Council on Foreign Relations event in 2018, he  recounted  that he had threatened to withhold a ""billion-dollar loan guarantee"" unless Poroshenko followed through on what Biden said was a ""commitment"" to ""take action against the state prosecutor."" ""I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time,"" Biden said. The timeline here is fuzzy: Shokin was not actually terminated while Biden was in the country, as Biden's story made it sound. Ukraine's legislature  voted  to fire Shokin in March 2016; Biden's  last visit  to Ukraine before the firing was in December 2015. Biden did have a  phone call  with Poroshenko the week before the dismissal. Biden spokesman Andrew Bates told CNN that Shokin's removal was a ""focus"" for Biden ""during numerous trips and phone conversations,"" since the prosecutor was such a major impediment to anti-corruption efforts.  What Trump has been getting wrong Trump is free to criticize Hunter Biden for taking a position with a Ukrainian company at the same time as his father was directly involved in Ukrainian issues. And Trump is free to criticize Joe Biden for declining to recuse himself from a matter that could conceivably have affected his son's interests.  But Trump has been inaccurate about some of the key facts of the situation.  Claim 1: Trump says Biden called for the firing of a prosecutor ""investigating his son"" Trump has repeatedly claimed Shokin was investigating Hunter Biden. For example, Trump  alleged  Saturday that the media wants to avoid talking about the ""Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son...""  But there is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation.  The investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors  since 2014 . The United Kingdom had  begun  investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board. ""Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws -- at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,"" Shokin's successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko,  told Bloomberg . Of a 2013 business transaction that was part of the investigation, Lutsenko said, ""(Hunter) Biden was definitely not involved. We do not have any grounds to think that there was any wrongdoing starting from 2014.""  It is not clear how hard Shokin was investigating even Zlochevsky or Burisma at the time Joe Biden pushed for Shokin's firing. Kasko, the prosecutor who resigned from Shokin's office,  told Bloomberg  that the case was dormant at the time of Joe Biden's intervention: ""There was no pressure from anyone from the US to close cases against Zlochevsky. It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.""  Shokin  told The Hill  for an April 2019 article that he had made ""specific plans"" before his firing that ""included interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.""  But his assertion that the investigation was active has been challenged.  ""Shokin was not investigating. He didn't want to investigate Burisma,"" Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Center,  told the Washington Post  for a July article. ""And Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation."" Claim 2: Trump says Biden told Ukraine to take Shokin off the case ""Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case,"" Trump  said  last week.  There is no evidence Biden ever called for Shokin to be ""taken off the case."" In fact, there is no evidence that Biden mentioned the case at all when discussing Shokin with Ukrainian officials. Rather, Biden generally pressured the Ukrainians to fire Shokin, according to reporting from multiple news outlets and Biden's own account of what happened. Trump's allies might argue that calling for the prosecutor's firing was even worse than calling for him to be taken off a particular case. But there is a key difference given the context. Had Biden called for Shokin to be taken off a particular matter in which his son had a stake, this would seem to suggest that his motivation was helping his son. But Biden calling for Shokin's firing, without mentioning that particular case, was consistent with the international concern about Shokin's performance.  Claim 3: Trump says Joe Biden previously said he spoke to Hunter Biden about Hunter's business dealings  Biden  said  Saturday, ""I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings."" Trump  responded  Sunday, ""He also said, long before, that he did speak to his son. So he lied, again.""  Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a  New Yorker article  in July. That article said this: ""As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: 'Dad said, ""I hope you know what you are doing,"" and I said, ""I do.'"" Once is more than never, so Trump can fairly point out the contradiction -- though the New Yorker article did not offer evidence that the father-son exchange was detailed. Regardless, the elder Biden was not contradicting himself; he was contradicting his son.  Claim 4: The amount of money at issue Trump has repeatedly  alleged  that Biden threatened to deny Ukraine ""billions of dollars."" According to Biden, it was a $1 billion loan guarantee. (Less than three months after Shokin was fired, Obama  agreed  to approve a $1 billion guarantee.) We don't have independent confirmation of what was discussed, so it's possible that Biden had also raised the subject of additional funds. One general caveat: it is possible that we'll generally learn more about Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine and about the firing of Shokin. But what we know right now shows significant factual problems with Trump's theories."
"""As soon as I saw that he had recommended it be sent to Congress, that's all I needed to know it was legit,"" said Mary McCord, the senior litigator from Practice at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection who worked with Atkinson at the US Attorney's Office and DOJ's National Security Division.   Several officials who acknowledged they are skeptical of the complaint told CNN the IC IG, Michael Atkinson, is a serious professional and that his recommendation gives them pause when they would have been inclined to dismiss the case otherwise.  Atkinson is widely regarded as a career non-partisan with little interest in the public limelight but he currently finds himself at the center of the  high profile controversy related to whether the whistleblower complaint . His recommendation that the complaint, which Atkinson says raised allegations of ""urgent concern,"" be shared with lawmakers has fueled the escalating standoff between the director of national intelligence and Congress while Trump has continued to publicly question the whistleblower's motives for speaking out.  But Atkinson has stood by his conclusion that the complaint indeed raises concerns that must be handed over to Congress in accordance with the law, despite clashing with his own boss, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, over that determination.  The House Intelligence Committee  released a letter  from Atkinson last week in which he wrote that he and Maguire, ""are at an impasse"" over that point, marking an unprecedented disagreement between the DNI and IC IG.  ""This involves something more sinister, something involving a serious or flagrant abuse or violation of law or misappropriation, and the IG underscored the seriousness of this, and also that this needs to be looked into. And right now, no one is looking into this,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Friday. Appointed as IC IG by Trump in 2018, Atkinson's long-standing reputation as a straight-shooter with professional integrity has bolstered the legitimacy of the whistleblower complaint despite the President's attempts to paint it as a partisan attack, multiple sources have told CNN.  Credible sense of urgency  Prior to his Senate confirmation to become IC IG in 2018, Atkinson worked for the Justice Department for over 15 years, according  to his biography on the ODNI website .  From 2002 through 2006, Atkinson worked as a trial attorney in DOJ's Criminal Division, Fraud Section. He then served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from 2006 through 2016, where he was the acting chief and deputy chief of the Fraud and Public Corruption Section.   Some of Atkinson's former colleagues agreed that his credentials as a non-partisan and relative obscurity prior to becoming involved in the whistleblower case lend weight to the seriousness of the complaint. Atkinson brought several major cases to the US Attorney's Office that were ""the result of thorough, quiet investigation,"" according to McCord, who served as the acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security at DOJ from 2016 to 2017 and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division from 2014 to 2016.  That quiet, non-partisan approach to his work is why McCord believed he would be a good fit for the IC IG role. ""The mere fact he was not on anyone's radar is points to the fact that his sense of urgency is credible,"" she said. ""People don't know who he is and that's because he does his job. He's the IG and most of that work is not in the public sphere."" ""You would not know which political party he favors by working with him. I worked with him for years. That's the other reason I feel he's so credible in this space,"" McCord added.   Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's National Security Division, John Carlin, told CNN that Atkinson is ""someone who is very deliberate, thoughtful and tries to carefully review facts ... not someone who seeks attention.""  ""So if he is in a situation where something needed to be referred that's because it was his best and informed view of what the law required,"" he said.  Not backing down? McCord told CNN that she believes Atkinson feels strongly that the complaint needs to be reported to Congress but is also trying to respect the hierarchy in place, which includes the DNI.  During a closed-door briefing with Schiff's committee on Thursday, Atkinson would only discuss the process for his handling of the whistleblower's concerns, the chairman said. Though lawmakers pressed him for details on the complaint, their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. The inspector general does not have the authority to discuss the details of the complaint with Congress because the DNI has not shared the actual report with the committee and had apparently not otherwise authorized Atkinson to share those details. Although the official details of the complaint have not been provided to members of Congress, Atkinson told the panel during the briefing that it raised concerns about multiple actions but would not say if those instances involved Trump, according to sources familiar with the briefing. According to one source, Atkinson referenced ""a sequence of events"" and ""alleged actions"" that took place. However, another source disputed that the IG provided substantive details regarding the whistleblower claim.  The whistleblower's complaint deals at least in part with a July call between Trump and Ukraine's president. CNN has previously reported that Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. Trump has admitted to discussing Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper.  There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. While Trump and some Congressional Republicans have attempted to downplay concerns surrounding the complaint, McCord told CNN that she does not see Atkinson backing down from his position.  ""If he got to a position where he saw resigning as the only alternative, he would do it ... but there is a lot of space between now and that point,"" McCord added, noting that Maguire is still expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.

"Top conservative blogger Matt Drudge says the Democratic presidential nomination is Elizabeth Warren's to lose; reaction on 'The Five.' A Wall Street executive made a gloomy prediction on Thursday about a potential  Elizabeth Warren  presidency, suggesting that the stock market ""won't open"" if she was sworn into office. Omega Advisors CEO Leon Cooperman appeared on CNBC to express his concerns and shared his predictions on what would happen if the Massachusetts senator was elected. ""There’s unquestionably a shift to the left in this country. They won’t open the stock market if Elizabeth Warren is the next president,"" Cooperman claimed. He later explained his rationale; “When I said they wouldn’t open the market if Elizabeth Warren won, my way of just saying the market would be very vulnerable.” WARREN GETS STUMPED BY COLBERT WHEN PRESSED ON MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES TO FUND MEDICARE-FOR-ALL When asked what will happen to the stock market if Warren clinches the Democratic nomination, Cooperman predicted that the market will be ""lower"" if she or her progressive colleague, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, becomes a ""credible opponent"" to President Trump, citing a potential ""25 percent"" dip in the market. ""Her policies are counterproductive, they're negative for capitalism, and the capitalism is what brought America to the position that we're in today,"" Cooperman added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Democratic 2020 hopeful offered a response to Cooperman on Twitter. ""Our economy works great for people who can use their money and power to become even richer and more powerful,"" Warren wrote. ""But I've got a plan to ensure it works for everyone else too. If that scares hedge fund billionaires like this guy, fine by me."""
"Fox Nation host  Tomi Lahren  blasted the latest controversial proposal from 2020  Democratic  presidential candidate Bernie  Sanders , I-Vt., to spend a whopping $2.5 trillion to guarantee housing for every American. “Guaranteed housing, add that to the list of socialist agenda items that sound good to some, but in reality, are just big government solutions that move our nation away from freedom and closer to  socialism ,” said Lahren on  Fox Nation’s  “Final Thoughts.” TRUMP SAYS CALIFORNIA CITIES 'DESTROY THEMSELVES' WITH HOMELESSNESS On Wednesday, Sanders unveiled his “Housing for All” plan. The progressive senator said there’s a shortage of 7.4 million affordable homes for the lowest-income renters. And he stressed that more than 18 million families across the country are paying more than half of their limited incomes on housing and utilities. A spokesman for President Trump's reelection  campaign  called it ""yet another pie-in-the-sky, big government socialist promise by the Bernie camp."" Lahren panned the plan as “another giant, expensive federal program” and blasted Sanders’ plan to pay for it all. “How does he plan to pay for it? The way all these Democrats plan to pay for their radical proposals, taxation.  Bernie claims a wealth tax on the top 1/10 of 1 percent of Americans will fund his initiative.” She continued, “Well, folks, he and others in his party already plan to dump the burden of Medicare-for-all, free college, medical debt cancellation, and the Green New Deal on the backs of the wealthy. Do they really think the top 1 percent can afford to fund the entire nation? Total income confiscation wouldn’t pay for all those programs!” Lahren argued that increasing taxes on the wealthy encourages them to move, leaving the middle class to foot the bill. “Here’s the thing about wealth, Bernie, it’s MOBILE. Meaning the wealthiest Americans are not going to sit idly by as their incomes are confiscated to fund your big government pie-in-the-sky plans,” Lahren said. She continued, “Then what? What happens when the richest Americans take their money elsewhere? Who pays for these quasi-socialist plans? Answer, we do. The middle class, the average American.” The concern that the wealthy may move to avoid paying taxes is not a hypothetical, according to Lahren. She said that is exactly what has happened in her state. “That’s why the middle class has been driven out of places like California, for cryin’ out loud. It’s only affordable for the exorbitantly wealthy and the homeless!” LAHREN ON AMERICAN UNITY AFTER 9/11: 'WE HAVE JUST LOST IT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY' Finally, Lahren said that Sanders’ proposal would not decrease homelessness. “I live in California, the state that is comprised of 47 percent of all unsheltered people in the nation. Yet what do we do here in California? We add more taxes, more regulations, more control on top of already cash-strapped residents and families. Here’s what else I know, throwing more government and more taxpayer dollars at the problem does not solve the problem. If it did we wouldn’t be in this predicament right here in California.” Lahren concluded, “When will these socialist wannabes figure it out?  Throwing taxpayer dollars, big government and entitlement at the problem does not solve the problem. It just moves our nation one dangerous step closer to socialism. Maybe that’s what people like Bernie want but it’s up to us to stand in his way.” To see Lahren's full remarks and for more episodes of Tomi Lahren's daily commentary offering a refreshing and unfiltered perspective on issues across the country, join  Fox Nation  and watch  ""First & Final Thoughts""   today.

"Democratic Caucus to meet on response to whistleblower complaint; Garrett Tenney reports from Washington. The rapidly escalating controversy over President Trump’s alleged efforts to pressure  Ukraine  to investigate the Bidens has, in turn, quickly increased pressure on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from within her Democratic caucus to take a definitive stance on impeachment proceedings. While House Judiciary Committee Democrats already have launched what they describe as  impeachmen t proceedings, Pelosi, D-Calif., until now has taken a cautious approach. TRUMP ADMIN CLAIMS UKRAINE AID WAS STALLED OVER CORRUPTION CONCERNS, DECRIES MEDIA 'FRENZY' But in the wake of reports that the White House froze millions in aid to Ukraine shortly before Trump allegedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, numerous congressional Democrats have publicly backed an impeachment inquiry. This includes some centrist members and senior Democratic lawmakers who had earlier shied away from such calls. The disagreements are likely to come to a head at a caucus meeting late Tuesday afternoon, where Fox News is told she'll announce a formal impeachment inquiry. “She’s all but out of options,” a Democratic source told Fox News ahead of the meeting. Speaking at a Washington forum with Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg, Pelosi confirmed she’d be making an announcement at 5 p.m. ET, without going into specifics. However, she seemed to set the table for an impeachment-related statement, accusing the director of national intelligence of “breaking the law” at the administration’s direction by not releasing a related whistleblower complaint. As for concerns about the political implications of moving on impeachment, Pelosi said: “This is about patriotism.” “The president is making lawlessness a virtue in this country,” Pelosi said. She even argued that it won’t be necessary to prove Trump delivered a “quid pro quo” – a comment that came as Trump announced, via Twitter, that he’ll be releasing a transcript of the phone call in question. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has already launched what he's described as impeachment proceedings, including a hearing last week featuring former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. But the Democratic source suggested Democrats are frustrated with Nadler’s approach, and looking for more action. “He’s not been able to deliver accountability surrounding the litany of crimes committed by the Trump syndicate,” the source told Fox News. A senior House Democratic source told Fox News there even has been discussion of a select committee to conduct an impeachment inquiry against Trump -- a move that would take it out of Nadler's hands. But the situation is fluid and other sources say they are waiting to hear from Pelosi during the caucus meeting. By Tuesday, even senior members of the caucus were joining the impeachment chorus. In an emotional speech on the House floor, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., called for an impeachment investigation, saying he ""has waited.” “Sometimes I’m afraid to go to sleep for fear that I will wake up and our democracy will be gone, will be gone, and never return,” he said. “This administration demonstrates complete disregard and disdain for ethics, for the law and for the constitution. They have lied under oath, they have refused to account for their action and appear before (a) legislative body, who have the constitutional right to inquire about their activities.” He added: “We cannot delay. We must not wait. Now is the time to act.” “The future of our democracy is at stake. There comes a time when you have to be moved by the spirit of history to take action to protect, preserve the integrity of our nation,” he continued. “I believe, I surely believe the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come. To delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy.” The new impeachment wave began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week that involved allegations that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky. A person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have “firsthand knowledge” of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, but Democrats want to see the complaint. The discussions apparently involved efforts to pressure Ukraine to look into a separate controversy involving the Biden family. Joe Biden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump and his allies have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate's role. At issue now is whether Trump sought to withhold military aid as leverage in seeking an inquiry. Multiple administration sources confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that the Office of Management and Budget told the State Department and Department of Defense in July that it was putting a hold on nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. But administration sources said this was tied to concerns about corruption and other issues. Trump, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, insisted he sought to hold up the Ukraine aid because he “wanted other countries to pay.” “There was no quid pro quo,” he said. “There was no pressure applied, nothing.” FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AMID BOMBSHELL REPORTS TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE AID But amid the reports about the frozen Ukraine aid money, late Monday night a slew of key swing-district Democrats publicly offered their support for opening a formal impeachment inquiry. Seven centrist Democratic freshmen lawmakers who served in the military and national security announced in an op-ed in The Washington Post that if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens for political benefit, it’s impeachable. The lawmakers included Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. The Democrats wrote in The Washington Post they ""do not arrive at this conclusion lightly."" Also, later Monday night, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz and Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell endorsed an impeachment inquiry. Such an inquiry would not be an impeachment vote, but rather an investigative process that could lead to actual impeachment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There are now 164 House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with  one independent  -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. An unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president.) Fox News' Mike Emanuel, Chad Pergram, Gregg Re and John Roberts contributed to this report. "
"That call, which took place on July 25, one day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was also part of  a whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, the source added, a revelation that is likely to raise more questions in the ongoing controversy.  The Wall Street Journal  was first to report that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the July phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son Hunter, citing multiple people familiar with the matter.  The Journal also reported that Trump told Zelensky ""that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know"" whether allegations were true or not, one of the people said, according to the Journal.  Trump did not discuss a pending aid package to the country in the July 25 call, indicating that there may not have been an explicit quid pro quo outlined by the President in the conversation, the source familiar with the issue told CNN.  A readout of the call put out by the Ukrainian government says, ""Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA."" Joe Biden responded to the new revelations in a strongly-worded statement Friday.  ""If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump's willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation—a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia—pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor,"" Biden said.  ""Such clear-cut corruption damages and diminishes our institutions of government by making them tools of a personal political vendetta. At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress,"" he added. Trump downplays whistleblower's claims  Before the Journal's report was published, Trump downplayed the significance of the whistleblower complaint at the center of the latest controversy consuming Washington. During remarks in the Oval Office Friday, Trump claimed the whistleblower is partisan and his conversations with foreign leaders are ""appropriate."" But in a back-and-forth with reporters, Trump did not deny discussing Biden with Zelensky in that July phone call -- a potential subject for the complaint. ""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" Trump said prior to the Journal's report being published while appearing alongside the Australian Prime Minister, who he was hosting for a state visit. Precise details of the accusation aren't known, much to the chagrin of Democratic lawmakers, who have demanded more information. ""To ask a foreign leader to interfere in a presidential election - right after a year long investigation into potential foreign interference in a presidential election - would be pretty extraordinary. Even for these times,"" Connecticut Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy tweeted Friday in reaction to the news.   Trump admitted Friday he did not know the whistleblower's identity, and said he wasn't even sure if it was his conversation with Ukraine's leader that was the topic of the complaint. But he nevertheless appeared defensive about his interactions with Zelensky, with whom he will meet next week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Trump still pushing Biden claim Asked whether he'd discussed Biden with Ukraine's Zelensky during a phone call in late July, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed,"" but insisted that someone should look into Biden. ""It was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor's taken off the case,"" Trump said, appearing to refer to January remarks when Biden discussed his interactions with Ukraine's leadership when serving as vice president. Appearing  in a rambling interview on CNN on Thursday evening , Giuliani admitted he had discussed Biden with Ukraine's leaders during a visit to the country. Giuliani has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden's call in 2016 to remove the country's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company connected to Biden's son, Hunter. Other Western governments also called for that prosecutor's dismissal, and no evidence has indicated Biden's move was inappropriate. Ukraine's prosecutor general told Bloomberg in May he had no proof of wrongdoing by Biden or his son. Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian President has come under scrutiny from House investigators and they have demanded more information about Trump and Giuliani's interactions regarding Ukraine and the Biden matter, including calls for a transcript of Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president. Democrats are also looking for more information about the whistleblower's complaint. ""There's a real sense of urgency here since the Inspector General was so clear this is not something that can wait,"" said House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff on Friday, a day after his panel was briefed behind closed doors by the inspector general."
"The Deep State tried to use an illegitimate tool to throw up a smokescreen to distract the American people from President Trump's success, says former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. The Democratic media  narrative  of impeachment portrays President Trump and his administration as serial law-breakers who, true to form, obstruct all congressional investigations of wrongdoing. This then becomes the analytical framework for every new controversy. There are at least two fundamental problems with this. First, our constitutional system is based on friction between competing  branches  vested with separate but closely related powers. The framers understood that the two political branches would periodically try to usurp each other’s authorities. Congress often does this by enactments that seek to subject executive power to congressional (or judicial) supervision. Presidential pushback on such laws is not criminal obstruction; it is the Constitution in action. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Second, we’ve become so law-obsessed that we miss the forest for the trees. Often, the least important aspect of a controversy — viz., whether a law has been violated — becomes the dominant  consideration . Short shrift is given to the more consequential aspects, such as whether we are being competently governed or whether power is being abused.

Omar addressed her concerns about Biden in a new  interview  with The Guardian, after appearing at the  Iowa  People’s Presidential Forum on Saturday. She said the former vice president lacked the excitement necessary to inspire long-lasting change. ""There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country. And I would say he is not one of them,"" she said.

"President Trump says his conversation with the Ukraine was perfect; he says Joe Biden made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son about his overseas business dealings. President Trump  answered questions Sunday morning regarding reports that a whistleblower complaint may have accused him of wrongdoing related to a July phone call with  Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and insisted that there was “absolutely nothing wrong” with the substance of the discussion. Trump reportedly has been accused of asking Ukraine’s leader multiple times to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, and using military aid as leverage. Trump denied making any improper requests. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE' “I said absolutely nothing wrong; it was perfect,” Trump said outside the White House before departing for Houston. “There was no quid pro quo, there was nothing,” he later added. Trump did point fingers at Biden, however. The Democratic presidential hopeful’s son Hunter Biden had been investigated related to business interests. Biden has said in the past that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden’s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. Trump accused Biden of being dishonest in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling the  New Yorker  that they spoke “just once” about it. “And now he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,” Trump said Sunday. “Of course you spoke to your son!” When asked about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump said it had nothing to do with the Biden family. ""Because I want Germany, and I want France, and I want the European Union to put up money,"" Trump said. ""And I didn't delay anything. We paid the military aid to the best of my knowledge."" BIDEN FACES SCRUTINY FOR DEMANDING OUSTER OF UKRAINE OFFICIAL PROBING FIRM THAT EMPLOYED HIS SON Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., doubted that Trump's conversation with Zelenskiy was innocent. ""Well if that’s the case, then why doesn’t the president simply release the transcript of that call?” Schiff said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Schiff also challenged Trump to allow the release of the whistleblower complaint, accusing Trump of not wanting to see either one. The Democratic congressman has long been a vocal critic of the president but has not been among those calling for his impeachment. Schiff said that may change in light of the reports of Trump's conversation with Ukraine. ""If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit … then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents.” Giuliani has acknowledged that he was involved in investigating Hunter Biden, but claimed that his original goal was to investigate ties between Ukraine and Democrats related to the 2016 election. He denied that he was specifically out to get Biden. “What they’re trying to say is I went there on a political mission to get Joe Biden in trouble,” Giuliani told “Fox News Sunday,” calling such a claim “ridiculous.” Giuliani said that the suspicion of Biden’s wrongdoing related to his son’s case was “inextricably linked” to what he had already been investigating related to the Democratic Party. “This is going to get bigger and bigger, and everything I say I can prove,” Giuliani said. Trump said he would be amenable to Giuliani discussing the matter before Congress. “I would have no problem,” the president said. “Rudy’s a straight shooter, and Rudy wants to see the same thing as a lot of other people when it comes to Ukraine.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also fielded questions about Ukraine on “Fox News Sunday,” but declined to get into specifics, only stating that Trump’s discussions with world leaders “have always been 100 percent appropriate, 100 percent lawful.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"
"5. The race to make the next debate:  The October 1 deadline to qualify for the fourth Democratic debate -- set for October 15 and sponsored by CNN and The New York Times -- is rapidly approaching, and with it the last chance, seemingly, for any lower-tier candidates to make the case that they shouldn't be counted out just yet. (Missing one debate is bad enough. Missing two is a political death sentence.) At the moment, the field is at 11, with wealthy businessman Tom Steyer making the October debate after narrowly missing the September set-to. The only other candidate who appears to be on the cusp of qualification is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who, with the  CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll  released over the weekend, now has three of the four polls that she needs showing her at 2% or higher. (Gabbard has already met the fundraising threshold with 130,000 unique donors.) Spiritual guru Marianne Williamson has met the fundraising qualification but has only a single poll that shows her at 2%. (She didn't even rate 1% in  the CNN-DMR poll .) The largest the debate field will grow then, realistically, is 12. Which means that eight candidates currently running won't be on the debate stage for the second straight month. Which should tell them all something. 4. Can Kamala come back?:  Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,""  said her campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez. So, will it work? Harris has her work cut out for her, according to the  new CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll.  She's at 6%, good for 5th place, at the moment but that is largely stagnant from where she's been in the state since December 2018. (She was at 5% then.) Harris is generally well-liked in the state -- 63% favorable/24% unfavorable -- but her unfavorables have tripled since March and her favorables have only bumped up marginally (58% in March). And those who feel strongly favorable toward Harris (26%) -- usually a good measure of energy behind a candidate -- runs behind her main rivals like Elizabeth Warren (44%), Pete Buttigieg (33%), Joe Biden (29%) and Bernie Sanders (26%). Harris does have time, as there are  still  134 days before the February 3, 2020 caucuses. But she has been stuck in the same place in Iowa for months. Which means she needs a jump-start. And soon. 3. Booker over and out?:  Cory Booker may be the next high-profile candidate out of the 2020 race, according to a memo from his campaign manager first reported by NBC. The memo suggested that unless the New Jersey senator can raise $1.7 million in the next 10 days, he will run out of money and be forced from the race. The campaign insisted the move was not a fundraising ploy, but it worked either way! As of Sunday morning, Booker had raised just over $300,000 in the first 24 hours of the fundraising push. Of course, $300K -- while good! -- is not $1.7 million. And you can't just keep warning that you are going to drop out of the race unless people give you more money for the remainder of the contest. The sky can only be falling once (or maybe twice!) ""I don't believe people should stay in this just to stay in it,"" Booker said in Iowa on Saturday. ""You either have a trajectory to win or not. And right now, we don't raise $1.7 million, we won't be able to make the investments necessary."" Booker may get his $1.7 million this time. But without significant poll improvements, it's hard to see how he can keep raising the money he is going to need to compete with the big girls and boys. He will, for sure, stay in the race until the next debate -- October 15 in Ohio and sponsored by CNN. But is there a path beyond that? 2. Elizabeth Warren, Iowa front-runner:  Warren has been the hottest candidate in the 2020 race for the past few months now. And it's showing up not just in national polling but now also in the crucial state of Iowa. The  Des Moines Register/CNN/MediaCom Iowa poll  released Saturday night showed Warren at 22% and at the top of the pack although followed closely by Joe Biden at 20%. No one else in the field was terribly close to the top two, with Bernie Sanders at 11% in third place and Pete Buttigieg in fourth with 9%. While the topline numbers are good for Warren, the trend lines are even better. She gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now. Warren's favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is beyond her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders. Couple all of those data points with the fact that Warren has, by far, the best ground organization in Iowa, and you have to make her the favorite in the Hawkeye State today. 1. Trump vs. Biden vs. Ukraine:  It's only September, but we're already getting a look at what a general election fight between Trump and Biden would look like. Faced with a whistleblower complaint from the intelligence community about a series of interactions between himself and the Ukrainians, Trump is trying to push the attention to Biden and his son, Hunter, vis a vis Ukraine. Fact checkers have  already debunked Trump's claims  about there being something nefarious in Biden's trip to the Ukraine in 2016 and his son's work for a natural gas company in the country, and there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either. Biden has pushed back aggressively. ""Every single outlet that's looked at this said there's nothing there there,""  he told the Iowa Starting Line . ""And me, nor anyone in my family did anything inappropriate. And every major outlet has acknowledged that. I just find it very Trump-like."" It is very ""Trump-like!"" Because, facts be damned, Trump has and will continue to use his media megaphone -- press gaggles + Twitter -- to push the idea that something was going on in Ukraine with the two Bidens. And if past is prologue, he won't stop -- no matter what fact-checkers or his advisers tell him. On the one hand, this fight is good for Biden. Electability is his strongest argument to Democratic voters -- and the more Trump hits Biden, the more the former vice president can seek to bypass the primary and begin running the general election. On the other, it's reminder that whether Biden or some other Democrat is the nominee, we can expect Trump to say and do literally anything in pursuit of a second term."
"As summer turns to fall, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden have separated themselves from the pack. The  gold standard poll in Iowa  showed Warren with 22% support and Biden with 20% of likely Democratic caucus-goers.  The new reality left more than a dozen other Democrats scrambling to keep the primary from turning into a two-person race -- with New Jersey Sen.  Cory Booker offering an extraordinary admission  that he might have no path forward.   Their weekend of retail politicking took place amid a national firestorm over reports that  President Donald Trump had pressed the Ukrainian president  to investigate the business dealings of Biden's son, Hunter Biden, in the country.  There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Warren arrived in Iowa newly at war with Democratic leaders in Congress. She declared -- first in a fundraising email, then in her speech in front of 12,000 Democrats at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday -- that "" Congress is complicit "" in Trump's actions because the Democratic-led House has failed to begin impeachment proceedings.  ""What the President has now demonstrated is that he thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors,"" Warren told reporters in Cedar Rapids. ""He can go back to the well on exactly what he did before. And that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election. It's time for Congress to step up and begin serious impeachment proceedings against this man.""  Biden, meanwhile, was at times testy with reporters over the news. It's the sort of clash that Biden has relished -- one that gave him the opportunity to go toe-to-toe with Trump as if the general election had already arrived.  But Biden was also insistent that the  focus should remain on Trump  improperly inviting foreign interference in a US election -- not on Biden and his son. ""Trump did a terrible thing,"" he said Sunday in Kansas City, Kansas -- his first stop after two days in Iowa. ""Focus on the violation of the Constitution this President has engaged in.""  But as he campaigned in Iowa -- a climate change speech and an LGBTQ forum in Cedar Rapids on Friday, then a Steak Fry appearance Saturday -- there were signs of trouble, including a poll that showed Warren as the second choice of 20% of Democrats surveyed to Biden's 10% -- a potentially important factor given Iowa's unique caucus rules that will force those backing candidates with less than 15% support to move on to their second choices.  He also faced criticism over his response to the moderator at the LGBTQ forum.  Lyz Lenz, an Iowa-based journalist and author, had asked Biden a pointed question about his voting record and his reference to Vice President Mike Pence as a ""decent guy.""  Biden paused and responded: ""You're a lovely person."" Then, on the way off the stage, Lenz tweeted, Biden ""said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart.' ""   ""It's 2019 -- we shouldn't be calling professional women sweethearts,"" Lenz told CNN backstage.  In Iowa, Warren and Biden appear to be the dominant forces a little more than four months from the Democratic caucuses. But there remains room for movement.  The poll found that just 20% of likely caucus-goers have a first-choice candidate and say they are unlikely to be persuaded to support someone else.  That reality was underscored at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday: While many of the 12,000 tickets organizers said they sold to the event were purchased by campaigns that brought their own supporters in, many attendees who had purchased their own tickets or gotten them from their local Democratic parties said in interviews that they were still considering multiple candidates.  Harper Folsom, a 23-year-old student from Manchester, Iowa, said her top two candidates are Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro -- but she also likes Biden, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Booker.  ""I think it's important to have the most diverse amount of voices that we can,"" she said.  Still, many of the Steak Fry attendees said they are ready for the field to winnow -- and the CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll found evidence of who voters have already broadly dropped from the lists of candidates they are considering.   Only eight candidates are even viewed favorably by a clear majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers: Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have by far the highest net favorability rating, followed by California Sen. Kamala Harris, Booker, Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, O'Rourke and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.  Entrepreneur Andrew Yang is viewed favorably by just four percentage points more of those polled than see him unfavorably. And the rest of the field -- including Castro, billionaire investor Tom Steyer and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, all of whom might qualify for the party's October presidential debate -- is viewed unfavorably by a majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers. Some candidates seeking a way out of the low single digits are turning to desperate measures.  Booker campaign manager Addisu Demissie started Saturday morning with a memo featuring  an unusual and startling admission : If Booker couldn't raise $1.7 million by the end of the month, he'd have no path forward and would need to exit the race.  The tactic appeared to work, at least initially. Demissie tweeted Sunday morning that Saturday had been Booker's biggest online fundraising day of the campaign, hauling in $300,000.  Other candidates were looking for a break-out at the Steak Fry in front of a crowd so large that it would have accounted for 5% of the total turnout in Iowa's record-breaking 2008 Democratic caucuses.  As Warren lingered at the Steak Fry for hours to greet and take pictures with attendees, Castro jumped into the line, and the two had a warm exchange.   Harris' campaign has  mastered the art of the entrance . She walked into the Steak Fry dancing alongside a marching drumline.  O'Rourke had one of the day's most memorable moments when he repeated his call for mandatory assault-style rifle buy-backs. He also took a jab at Democratic leaders in Washington, saying they should not ""live in fear"" of Trump and the National Rifle Association, days after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had said no other members of the party agree with O'Rourke's position.  ""This is how we free ourselves from fear. We decide what we believe in and we fight like hell to achieve it -- and we don't let anyone, whether it's the NRA, the corporations, or the political action committees, or even our fellow Democrats tell us what is possible and what is not possible,"" O'Rourke said. ""We the people decide what is possible in this country.""  ""I thought Beto really got people motivated,"" said Ray Johnson, a 67-year-old consumer protection worker in West Des Moines.  He and his wife said they were also considering backing O'Rourke, as well as Warren and Buttigieg, and said they were most concerned with who will defeat Trump. Johnson said he likes Biden, but thinks Democrats need someone younger who can excite voters.  Buttigieg, meanwhile, is seeking to leverage the eye-popping $25 million he raised in the last fundraising quarter in Iowa, where he is already on the air with television ads.  His campaign bought the second-most tickets to the Steak Fry after Biden, and turned in the day's most raucous appearance as a light rain fell in Des Moines.  Then, Buttigieg started a four-day bus tour of Iowa -- with reporters in tow and allowed to ask the candidate questions at any point.  At the Steak Fry, Nikki Lunden, a 41-year-old warehouse worker from Iowa City, said Buttigieg is her favorite candidate -- but most importantly, she wants to support ""who's going to win it.""  Robert Hein, who had driven from Minnesota -- a Super Tuesday state -- with his wife Amy, said he was ""thinking maybe somebody young might be the better choice"" after hearing former President Jimmy Carter say there should be an ""age limit"" for the presidency that would exclude Biden. He said he was already impressed by Buttigieg and left even more so. He said Biden represents ""a guarantee that we can get Trump out of there.""  ""But the more I listen to these folks, I think there are a good number of them who have a good shot at beating him in November,"" he said. "

"New revelations, and now a previously-unseen interview, raising questions over former Vice President Joe  Biden's  account of his handling of Anita  Hill's  1991 sexual harassment allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence  Thomas .

In  'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching ',  former Senator Orrin Hatch R-Utah, who sat on the 1991 Judiciary committee with Biden, told Fox Nation that Biden told him during the hearings that he 'didn’t believe [Hill].'""

Thomas' nomination was eventually confirmed by a narrow majority of 52 to 48.  Biden voted against sending Thomas to the Supreme Court. “Biden was always confidentially talking to Thomas saying ‘I’m with you. I’m with you.’  That’s something that people don’t know.  Biden was very much encouraging him, behind the scenes.

"The party's inexorable tug to the left could push suburban women and others to the Republican camp, says Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary. Former  White House  Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Monday that moderate  Democrats  have to “distance themselves” from the more  progressive  wing of their party. “When you’re in the primary... the tug to the left is inexorable and it just pulls them all, including now Biden who is running to the left,” Fleischer told  “The Daily Briefing” with Dana Perino. The comments came after  Rep. Ilhan Omar , D-Minn., said she doesn't think former Vice President  Joe Biden  can be the progressive leader she believes the party needs heading into the  2020 presidential election , against  President Trump . ILHAN OMAR REFUSES TO BACK BIDEN, SAYS FORMER VICE PRESIDENT ISN'T RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD DEMS IN 2020 Omar addressed her concerns about Biden in a new interview with The Guardian, after appearing at the Iowa People’s Presidential Forum on Saturday. She said the former vice president lacked the excitement necessary to inspire long-lasting change. ""There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump pressed the Ukrainian president in a July call to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son, according to a person familiar with the conversation, an apparently blatant mixture of foreign policy with his 2020 re-election campaign. Mr. Trump also repeatedly told the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, to talk with his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had been urging the government in Kiev to investigate Mr. Biden and his family, according to two other people briefed on the call. Mr. Trump’s request is part of the secret whistle-blower complaint that is said to be about Mr. Trump and at least in part about  his dealings with Ukraine , according to two people familiar with the complaint. Mr. Biden is a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. The president has made no secret that he wanted Ukraine to investigate any improper overlap between Mr. Biden’s own diplomatic efforts there and his son’s role with a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. “Someone ought to look into Joe Biden,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday in response to a question about his call with Mr. Zelensky. The revelations added urgency to questions about Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, which is battling Russian-controlled separatists in the country’s east. When the president sought the Biden investigation, the Trump administration’s military aid to Ukraine had been frozen for weeks. The United States suspended that assistance in early July, according to a former American official. Mr. Trump did not discuss the aid in the July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky, whose government did not learn of the suspension until August, according to people familiar with the call. The Wall Street Journal  first reported  details of the call. For Democrats who want to examine the whistle-blower complaint — itself the subject of  an internal administration dispute  over whether to hand it over to Congress, as is generally required by law — the key question is whether Mr. Trump was demanding a quid pro quo, explicitly or implicitly. Democratic House committee chairmen  are already investigating  whether he manipulated American foreign policy for personal political advantage and have requested the transcript of the Zelensky call. The growing controversy had echoes of the dominant scandal of the first years of Mr. Trump’s administration: whether his campaign sought help from Russia to benefit him in 2016. Ultimately,  the special counsel found  that although “insufficient evidence” existed to determine that Mr. Trump or his advisers engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the Russians, his campaign welcomed Moscow’s election sabotage and expected to benefit from it. Any attempt by Mr. Trump to ask a foreign power to “dig up dirt” on a political rival while withholding aid is corrupt, said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, one of the panels examining Mr. Trump’s Ukraine dealings. “No explicit quid pro quo is necessary to betray your country,”  tweeted Mr. Schiff , who has also pushed for the whistle-blower complaint to be given to Congress. Mr. Trump opened a direct counterattack on Friday against the whistle-blower, whose identity is unknown, as are many details about the complaint. The president dismissed the allegations and labeled the whistle-blower, without evidence, a political partisan. “It’s a ridiculous story. It’s a partisan whistle-blower,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, though he acknowledged he did not know the person’s identity. “They shouldn’t even have information.” Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have pressed for an investigation of the Bidens for weeks, after reports this year in  The New York Times  and  elsewhere  examined whether a Ukrainian energy company sought to buy influence in Washington by hiring Mr. Biden’s younger son, Hunter Biden. The younger Biden had a lobbying business in Ukraine while his father was vice president. When he was vice president, Mr. Biden cast himself as both the Obama administration’s advocate of military assistance to Kiev as well as the chief antagonist of the notorious corruption in Ukraine’s government. In early 2016, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in American loan guarantees if Ukraine’s top prosecutor was not dismissed after accusations that he had ignored rampant corruption. Mr. Biden succeeded; the prosecutor general was voted out office. And Hunter Biden had an interest in the outcome: He sat on the board of an energy company that had been in the sights of the ousted prosecutor general. On Friday, the former vice president accused Mr. Trump in a statement of using the power of the United States to extract “a political favor.” Mr. Biden called for the president to release the transcript of his call with Mr. Zelensky and said that if the reports about it proved true, “there was no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.” He also said the allegations that he or his son committed wrongdoing in Ukraine were baseless. “Not one single outlet has given any credibility to his assertion,” Mr. Biden told reporters after a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Controversy over the Trump administration’s Ukraine policy has swirled for weeks but has been confined mostly to foreign policy experts. The revelations about the whistle-blower complaint plunged the issue into the center of the political debate. Congress has still not seen the whistle-blower’s allegation. Although the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, has sought to provide it, the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has blocked him in  a dispute over legal requirements . Mr. Maguire and his general counsel decided against providing the complaint to Congress after consulting with Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, according to a person familiar with the move. Mounting evidence that the White House was involved in the effort to withhold the complaint from lawmakers has stirred anger on Capitol Hill. Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Mr. Maguire of violating the law. “If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,” she added in a statement. Republicans were largely silent about Mr. Trump’s calls for a foreign investigation of his political rival. Their apparent desire to avoid criticizing the president during a political crisis stood in contrast to the criticism from party members after the administration froze aid to Ukraine. The administration, critics said, has struggled to explain the move, which has convinced some Democrats that it was part of an effort bring about a Biden investigation. “They have no shame,” said Michael Carpenter, a former aide to Mr. Biden and expert on Ukraine. He added: “They released the assistance in mid-September after the bipartisan uproar over the freeze — and under pressure from the House investigations. But strikingly, the administration never articulated why the assistance was frozen in the first place.” Mr. Giuliani has spearheaded a push for a Biden inquiry. He  met with Mr. Zelensky’s emissaries  this summer in hopes of encouraging his government to pursue investigations into the family as well as whether Ukrainian officials took steps during the 2016 election to damage Mr. Trump’s campaign. Mr. Giuliani has said he was acting on his own, though his comments on Thursday seemed to draw a closer connection to Mr. Trump. “A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job,”  Mr. Giuliani tweeted  shortly after  an appearance on CNN,  where he first denied, then admitted, asking the government in Kiev to investigate the Bidens. Although they agreed to meet with Mr. Giuliani, the Ukrainians have so far refused to open the investigations. But there is little doubt the pressure from Mr. Trump is causing stress on the new government, according to a former Ukrainian official. Since 2014, Ukraine has been under attack by Russia and its proxy, a fight that has become a grinding conflict that has made it difficult for Kiev to continue its overhaul efforts and work to become more integrated with Europe and the West. But now Ukraine also finds itself potentially at odds with the leader of its most critical partner, the United States, and at the center of a political battle in Washington. Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky  will meet next week  on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, a senior administration official confirmed on Friday after Mr. Zelensky’s office announced the meeting. But the administration has put off any commitment for a White House meeting, which Mr. Zelensky views as critical for the relationship."
"New reaction from  Fox Nation  host  Tammy Bruce  after former Massachusetts Gov. and  2020 Republican primary  contender  Bill Weld  suggested that  President Trump  should be killed for committing treason. ""In a normal world this would be shocking and it would not come from someone Americans take seriously, but it highlights how seriously broken opponents of the President have become.  It is also a reflection of the nature of the rhetoric that the establishment has propagated ever since they felt threatened by the Trump presidency,"" Bruce told Fox News. BRUCE: TRUMP HATERS CONSUMED WITH RAGE, SPEW UNHINGED RHETORIC On Monday, Weld appeared on MSNBC to weigh in on the escalating controversy over the President's phone call to the President of Ukraine.  Scrutiny of the call was sparked by reports of a whistleblower's complaint that the President suggested a quid pro quo with a foreign leader, and now additional reports that the White House froze some aid to Ukraine shortly before Trump asked Ukraine's president to  investigate  Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Administration sources told Fox News that the reason for the aid freeze was tied to concerns about corruption. “Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election, it couldn’t be clearer. And that’s not just undermining democratic institutions, that is treason. It’s treason pure and simple. And the penalty for treason under the U.S. Code is death. That’s the only penalty,"" said  Weld  on MSNBC sitting alongside fellow GOP primary challengers Joe Walsh and Mark Sanford. In a recent  opinion piece  on FoxNews.com and in the latest episode of  ""Get Tammy Bruce""  on Fox Nation, Bruce examined the apparent rise of violent rhetoric among critics of the President.  Just weeks later after writing that piece, she found it glaring relevant again, though she said that was not a surprise. ""When I wrote  this opinion piece  I knew that we were on this trajectory.  It turned out to be – unfortunately – what we call ‘evergreen commentary’ because it would still be relevant weeks, months and even years later.  This is now the trajectory of the Left and critics of the President... unleashing even more unhinged rhetoric to demonstrate to the baying leftist mobs how much they hate him,"" explained Bruce. In her  column  and on Fox Nation, Bruce also argued that the level of vitriol directed at the President is rooted in the establishment's distaste for the voters that propelled Trump to the White House. ""The public chattering class of Democrats and  Republicans  who remain apoplectic about Trump’s success and their own pathetic failures hate Trump because they hate the average American who put him in office. The president is the proxy for the American voter and every person who dared to fire the establishment in 2016, and it’s those people who must be dealt with,"" wrote Bruce. Additionally, the examples of this dangerous rhetoric are numerous and growing, according to Bruce, and she believes the media plays a role in stoking it.

"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — College students are back on campus.  Bernie Sanders  is, too. Earlier this month at Iowa State University, he lectured to young voters as they played “Green New Deal Pong” (the  Solo cups  were filled with green-colored water) and “Bern Bag Toss.”  At the University of Nevada, Reno,  he croaked through a hoarse voice to address a crowd that stretched from the college lawn to the open-air floors of a  parking garage beside it. And at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Thursday evening, he implored students to get themselves to the primary polls come February — and vote for him. “You have friends out there, and I know you do, who think that the political system” is absurd, he said, using a colorful expletive. “Tell them that instead of just complaining, they must get involved into the political process.” It was a sentiment he has repeated often this month as he crisscrossed the country on what has amounted to a whirlwind back-to-school tour. In Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina, he has by turns used flattery (“Your generation is the most progressive younger generation in the history of this country”) and subtle warnings (“The future of this country and in fact the world rests with your generation”) to bolster his appeals. Everywhere, his goal was the same: muster a version of the army of young voters who propelled his campaign in 2016. His message was one that has resonated with Brianna Williams, 19, who arrived with a group of friends to hear him in Chapel Hill .  “I’ve seen a lot of his policies, and I’m just excited for what he has to offer as a candidate,” she said. But she was just as excited by Senator Elizabeth Warren. “I would love to see a woman running the country,” she said. “That would be really cool.” Last time around, Mr. Sanders’s rants against the elite and promises of free college tuition endeared him to legions of young fans. It also helped that Mr. Sanders —  74  at the time, with unruly white hair and an old-school Brooklyn accent — was both decidedly uncool and new to presidential politics, affording his campaign a paradoxical edge that inspired millions of young supporters to “feel the bern” and vote for him over Hillary Clinton.  As he fights anew for the Democratic nomination, it is not lost on him or his allies that his success hinges, in no small part, on his ability to capture that enthusiasm again —  for both the optics of his race and the actual votes.   But this time he is no longer an insurgent, nor is he the only anti-establishment candidate in the race — factors that helped boost his standing among young voters. With the race entering the crucial fall period, other candidates, including Ms. Warren and Andrew Yang, have begun siphoning off some of his support. [ Sign up for our politics newsletter  hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race. ] Even Mr. Sanders’s closest advisers acknowledge that he cannot take for granted a voting cohort they view as critical, even if it is traditionally unreliable in actually making it to the ballot box. “Last time it was much more organic,” Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, said. “And this time it’s far more intentional.” In interviews, many young voters still praised Mr. Sanders, sometimes breathlessly — citing his authenticity and conviction but also his calls for free college and universal health care and his proposal to cancel student debt. But many also expressed curiosity, if not exuberance, about other candidates  “I love everything he stands for,” said Asha Loutsch, 18, as she sat with a circle of friends who were waiting for his event at the University of Iowa. “I think he really cares about what he’s trying to say. Like, he’s always getting up in there, you know?” But she also said she was interested in Ms. Warren and wanted to hear her speak. Jiego Lim, an 18-year-old student at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was volunteering at Mr. Sanders’s event there, said he supported Mr. Sanders but was also intrigued by Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris. “I feel like we need a fresh new face in politics,” he said. “Bernie comes off aggressive to me sometimes.” Others were less equivocal.  “He’s America’s dad,” offered Gabriel Olier, 19, a student in Reno. “I love Bernie.” That affection for Mr. Sanders is reflected in some more tangible metrics. His campaign said it had so far raised over $1 million from people under the age of 25, a relatively small figure compared to his overall haul but one that nevertheless points to his continued strength with young voters. [ Here’s the latest data  on who’s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] And in most polls, Mr. Sanders still maintains a strong lead among young voters:  A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey  showed that a third of voters under 35 supported him. Yet at the same time, a quarter of these respondents said they supported Ms. Warren , suggesting Mr. Sanders no longer has the same hold on the group he had in 2016. Any candidate relying on the support of younger voters faces an undeniable challenge: Younger voters tend not to vote in high numbers compared with other groups. In the 2016 election, for instance, only  11 percent of voters  under 30 participated in the Iowa caucuses, representing just 15 percent of the total, according to an estimate from the  Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and  Engagement   at Tufts University. But the high turnout among young voters during the 2018 midterm elections has given some experts hope that the 2020 election will be different. That strong showing has provided organizers with a larger pool to identify and target potential presidential voters. Issues, including climate change, criminal justice, health care and gun control, are also motivating young voters to act. “The truth is that if younger people in this country voted at the same level as people 65 and over, we could transform this country,” Mr. Sanders said this month at the University of Iowa. “Please do it!” John Della Volpe , the director of polling at Harvard’s  Institute of Politics , said that Mr. Sanders was still “doing really well” but that the field was more complex and his pool of support was smaller. “At this stage, he’s essentially sharing support of young people in most polls with Elizabeth Warren,” Mr. Della Volpe said. “The idea of going after structural reforms is really, I think, what is resonating so clearly with young people.” Indeed, of all the other candidates, it is Ms. Warren who appears to be generating the most powerful wave of energy among young voters in Democratic presidential politics — particularly among those who once supported Mr. Sanders. Olivia Stecklein, 19, a student at the University of Iowa, said she had been a fan of Mr. Sanders since 2015 but was now choosing between him and Ms. Warren. “I feel like they’re pretty similar, but I just kind of like how Elizabeth Warren has a set-out plan for everything,” she said. “She just seems very prepared.” Eliza Link, 18, a University of Iowa student, said she was also deciding between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. “I think they’re both the cool aunt and uncle of the political race right now,” she said. With his characteristic verve that can exhaust even young reporters, Mr. Sanders has been in an all-out sprint to earn the vote of the youths, months before any of them can even cast their vote.  His team set up a Bernie Summer School program to train campus leaders in the art of campaigning. He urged his campaign to get him back on college campuses in the first weeks of the new school year. He constantly asks his team to share data on young voters. To win over the group, however, Mr. Sanders will have to convince people like Tim Watts, 19. Before Mr. Sanders’s event in Reno, Mr. Watts wore a “MATH” hat, the universal accessory of Yang supporters. But despite his overt support for Mr. Yang — who in some ways is benefiting from the outsider status among young voters that Mr. Sanders enjoyed in 2016 — Mr. Watts said he had not yet closed the door on Mr. Sanders. “I’m part of the Yang gang, I guess,” he said. “I will probably feel the bern later.” Rachel Shorey contributed reporting from Washington."

"""Because of your campaign, I feel like I can be myself,"" the 16-year-old, who has autism,  told Buttigieg after his remarks. ""I can go to school and talk about what I believe in, and I don't have to be ashamed of who I am."" Since that meeting, Buttigieg has shared that story on the trail on stops in New Hampshire and South Carolina. But his stop here in Clinton on Tuesday, as part of his bus tour through the state, was the first time Buttigieg reunited with the young supporter. ""This is a very special appearance because I'm being reunited with somebody whose story I've been sharing lately,"" Buttigieg told the audience. ""And I'm proud to know that a campaign can help her feel like she can stand up tall and be who she is. Because that means that, long before the first vote is even cast, we are creating that kind of culture of belonging that every one of our supporters can spread, that everyone who is here can go out and spread to others, to let everybody know where you fit."" Bissell said Buttigieg sharing their meeting on the trail has changed her life, too. ""Seeing someone just important, talk about it and all of that, it really makes me feel validated,"" Bissell told CNN Tuesday. ""And I really hope that it helps validate other people with autism and other disabilities and things like that to be themselves too."" Bissell's mother, Suzanne, has found herself moved by Buttigieg's campaign too. ""For him to have seen the light that we always have seen in Bridget is pretty amazing,"" Suzanne Bissell told CNN. ""To not only hear her and listen to her, but then to remember it. I mean, he sees thousands of people."" Bissell, who homeschools her daughter, says she's proud of her daughter's courage. ""We used to practice with looking people in the eye and she now has the confidence to talk to Pete, to a presidential candidate, and to admit her scariest secret ever, that she has autism. She had never told anybody publicly until that day that she had it. And so, it's huge."" Buttigieg invited the Bissells on board his campaign bus after his Clinton town hall for a tour. There, he chatted with his young supporter, and they bonded over their shared love of music, including the clarinet, which Buttigieg played in high school and Bridgette Bissell enjoys. ""It obviously means a lot to know that the things that she's going through in life are easier,"" Buttigieg told reporters after his campaign stop in Clinton. ""That it's better because of what we're doing. And I think in many ways it reminds us why we're doing it."" ""It was really, really touching to talk to obviously see Bridgette, but also to talk to her mom about what this means. And it's also a reminder about how much more is at stake in the presidency than just policy. I mean, policy is a huge dimension of what government is about. But it's not the only thing the presidency is responsible for. Just by virtue of being the most visible person in the country, you can help or harm so many people in so many ways."" For her part, Bridgette Bissell is excited to have shaped a presidential campaign with her own story. ""That makes me feel so proud, and love, and validated, because I struggle a lot with doubts, with doubts about myself,"" she told CNN. ""The reason why I support him is that he shows everybody's voice is important. It doesn't matter who you love, what your gender is, anything, how, what your ability level is. It doesn't matter. You have a voice and it matters."" As for what's next for the Bissells? They're all in for Buttigieg now, Suzanne Bissell says. She hails from El Paso, Texas, the hometown of another 2020 Democratic candidate, Beto O'Rourke, but after meeting Buttigieg, ""there was no other candidate"" for her. ""I've never been political ever, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to help him,"" she told CNN. ""Like we're going to have a party at our house for him and invite friends. That's not something I usually do. I'm kind of a private, I don't like to talk about politics with friends, but I'm willing to do it for him."""

"And yet, we are hearing a lot of meowing of protest from the field. Candidates have said they are being forced  to adjust  their campaign strategies away from winning votes to meet these benchmarks; party insiders are saying the benchmarks  are excluding  highly credentialed voices in favor of celebrity candidates; and down-ballot Democrats are  complaining  the donor threshold is taking much-needed money away from their races. But first, let's be clear that  Democratic primary voters  want to  narrow the field.  Generally speaking, a larger and more fractured field tends to benefit some front-runners (Joe Biden) while  disadvantaging others  (Elizabeth Warren). And, of course, no candidate left off the stage is going to praise a system that torpedoed his campaign, but even those candidates know they can't get their message across with 24 people on the stage. This is all to say, there is no solution to make everyone happy.  The Republican National Committee experienced much the same problem in 2016 and some of us would argue blew it in far more epic fashion. (Full disclosure: I worked for Carly Fiorina during 2016 and was watching the March debate from my hotel room as a handful of dudes  tossed around not-so-veiled references  to the size of their  penises .) My point being that we should at least give the DNC credit for trying to trim the fat with a scalpel instead of the RNC's machete that arbitrarily set and reset qualifications each month based solely on poll numbers.    Even so, I am not the first to point out that there's something  wrong here . Polling and fundraising don't measure whether someone will be a good president -- or even a good candidate. And incentivizing your candidates to spend money to meet those thresholds doesn't move the ball down the field for the party or the eventual nominee. And of course, there's the absurdity of putting that much stock in national name recognition whereby the only way for your candidate to get exposure to tens of millions of viewers during the debate is to have high national poll numbers, which more often than not are simply a  reflection of name recognition  among voters who have already been exposed to that candidate. Captain Yossarian would be proud. It's almost as if you'd be better off if you'd starred on a hit reality TV show for years instead of served as a governor or run a Fortune 50 company.  Defenders of the system, though, would say it's working. We started with 20 debaters, and by November, we may be  down to eight .   But here's the problem. If we had whittled the field too quickly in 1991, there would have been no President Clinton. By July of 1991, he had a  polling average  of only 1.7% -- in a tie for 13th place with Jay Rockefeller. As Nate Silver  has pointed out , in two of the past nine cycles, the eventual Democratic nominee was not even in the top 10 by July -- and both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton went on to win the presidency the next year.  So here's an alternative I'm proposing to the DNC:  The top three polling candidates according to an average of qualifying national polls get an automatic ticket to the stage. In the end, this is still our closest approximation to votes. But why should this be coupled with fundraising? If you're a great, progressive candidate who has managed to capture the support of 20% of your party's supporters without creating an enormous money machine, you have perhaps all the more reason to be on that stage.   Any candidate with a million individual donors gets a ticket. The goal of this metric isn't to reward a big fundraising haul but to measure support that may not be showing up in the polls. The threshold, therefore, must be meaningful and high. Bernie Sanders is the  only candidate  to hit this number so far. But by way of example, if Sanders were polling at only 2% nationwide, would the DNC really want to exclude a guy with a million high-enthusiasm Democratic voters who presumably has a uniquely powerful message that is resonating with those who have heard it?  Any candidate with more than 15% support when the same polling averages are weighted for name recognition would be on the stage. Silver has a nice chart on adjusted polling averages  here . But in short, if two candidates both have 5% in the latest poll but Candidate A's names is familiar to 80% of voters and Candidate B is known by only 30% of voters, we would assume Candidate B would poll higher than Candidate A if all voters knew who both of them were. So you would ""weight"" that poll by multiplying their support as if they had the same name recognition as the most well-known candidate ( Biden ). Suddenly, Candidate B would have a weighted polling average just over 15%. Side note: It boggles my mind why this hasn't already happened. If voters haven't heard your message because you're, let's say, the governor of Montana without a lot of national airtime, why would the party want to limit your only chance to reach a broader audience with how you've succeeded in implementing progressive policies? And on the flip side, if you are a celebrity politician with near-universal name recognition among voters but only 4% support in a poll, do we really need to hear more? These rules would have ensured Clinton made the stage in 1991. Ironically, it also would have excluded Biden  in 2007  (along with Dennis Kucinich, Wesley Clark and Chris Dodd, among others).    And what of 2020? Of course, it's impossible to say for sure because the candidates would have run their campaigns differently if the DNC rules had been, well, different. Like those who talk about the popular vote versus the Electoral College, you can't rerun the game with different rules and assume the same inputs. But as of July, the field would have been narrowed to Biden, Sanders, Kamala Harris, Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke. And given how close Cory Booker and Andrew Yang would have been to the cutoff, it seems fair to assume they would have tweaked their strategies to get to an adjusted 5% as well.  Funny enough, it's the same eight who will probably be on the stage come November. But it sure sounds a lot fairer, doesn't it?"

"Dr. Marc Siegel weighs in on 2020 Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders' health care plan. Sen. Bernie Sanders  on Tuesday unveiled a massive tax on the wealthiest Americans that aims to diminish income inequality -- a central theme of his campaign -- and at least begin to finance the steep price tags for the numerous government programs the Democratic presidential candidate is proposing. The release of the  independent senator from Vermont's  ‘Tax on Extreme Wealth’ follows a similar plan from one of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, fellow progressive and populist lawmaker  Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. “There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people,” Sanders said on Twitter as he urged supporters to read his new plan. His campaign also sent an email under the subject line: ""Billionaires should not exist."" THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN In his decades in Congress and during both of his runs for the White House, Sanders has railed against an American economic system that he says favors corporations and the rich, at the expense of the working class. Sanders' plan , if enacted into law, would place a 1 percent tax on net worth over $32 million, a 2 percent tax on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, and a 3 percent tax on net worth between $250 million and $500 million. The proposed Sanders tax would increase to 4 percent net worth from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent for net worth from $1 billion to $2.5 billion, and ultimately reach 8 percent for wealth over $10 billion. The Sanders campaign says their plan would impact approximately 180,000 households nationwide, and would raise about $4.35 trillion in government revenue by the 2028 budget year. “Our tax on extreme wealth would only apply to the wealthiest households in America and would cut the wealth of billionaires in half over 15 years, which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small, privileged class,” Sanders said in an email to supporters announcing his plan. And he said that he would “use the revenue to fund our affordable housing plan, universal childcare, and help fund our work to guarantee health care as a right for every man, woman, and child in this country."" The Republican National Committee criticized Sanders, with spokesman Michael Joyce arguing that “no matter how many new taxes Bernie proposes, it still won’t come even close to covering the costs of Bernie’s socialist pie-in-the-sky policy proposals.” Warren’s plan – which she unveiled at the beginning of the year-- by comparison would place a 2 percent annual tax on net worth above $50 million and would slap a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion. Her campaign says it would affect the top 70,000 households in the county and would bring in an estimated $2.6 trillion over 10 years. Sanders, in order “ensure that the wealthy are not able to evade the tax,” is calling for creating a national registry and beefing up third-party reporting requirements, increasing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and requiring the IRS to perform audits of 30 percent of those in the 1 percent bracket and audits of all billionaires.  He’s also calling for a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and a steeper 60 percent on assets over $1 billion “for all wealthy individuals seeking to expatriate to avoid the tax.” President Trump’s re-election campaign took aim at Sanders, not specifically over his new plan but for vows by the senator and the rest of the Democratic field to repeal the tax cuts passed in 2017 by the then-GOP controlled Congress and signed into law by the president. “By repealing President Trump’s tax cuts, Sanders and the rest of the Democrats would raise taxes on almost all Americans, not just the very rich,” campaign spokesperson Erin Perrine said.

"But in a back-and-forth with reporters, he did not deny discussing former Vice President Joe Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call -- a potential subject for the complaint.  And he admitted he did not know the whistleblower's identity, despite his accusation of partisanship. It was a robust self-defense against accusations that remain, for now, veiled in mystery. An intelligence watchdog has said the claims are ""urgent"" and ""serious,"" but the acting top intelligence official has declined to provide them to Congress. Trump dismissed them as another attempt to bring down his presidency. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump called the story ""ridiculous"" and described the whistleblower as ""just another political hack job.""  ""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" Trump said alongside his Australian counterpart, who he was hosting for a state visit. Asked whether he'd discussed Biden with Ukraine's Zelensky during a phone call in late July, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed,"" but insisted that someone should look into Biden. ""It was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor's taken off the case,"" Trump said, appearing to refer to January remarks when Biden discussed his interactions with Ukraine's leadership when serving as vice president. ""The fake news,"" Trump claimed,""doesn't look into things like that."" Trump's remarks came a day after the New York Times and Washington Post reported that an intelligence whistleblower had submitted a complaint related to Trump's interactions on Ukraine. Precise details of the accusation aren't known, much to the chagrin of Democratic lawmakers, who have demanded more information. Trump admitted Friday he did not know the whistleblower's identity, and said he wasn't even sure if it was his conversation with Ukraine's leader that was the topic of the complaint. But he nevertheless appeared defensive about his interactions with Zelensky, whom he will meet next week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Appearing in a rambling interview on CNN on Thursday evening, the President's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani admitted he himself had discussed Biden with Ukraine's leaders during a visit to the country. That conversation has come under scrutiny from House investigators, who have demanded more information about Trump and Giuliani's interactions regarding Ukraine and the Biden matter. That includes a transcript of Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president. Democrats are also looking for more information about the whistleblower's complaint. ""There's a real sense of urgency here since the Inspector General was so clear this is not something that can wait,"" said House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff on Friday, a day after his panel was briefed behind closed doors by the inspector general."
"Juan Williams backs Biden's claim about Trump, Ukraine story President Trump  is attacking former  Vice President Joe Biden  over his son Hunter's involvement with a Ukrainian energy firm because recent polls show him  defeating the president head-to-head , according to Juan Williams. The reports Trump  continues to discuss  -- surrounding allegations of unsubstantiated wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter related to dealings with Kiev -- are not new, but the president would like to tar the former vice president by whatever means necessary, Williams claimed Monday on "" The Five ."" ""This is not new about Hunter Biden and his dad,"" he said. ""The whole thing is just, Trump has a style, which is he goes on the offensive when he's under attack."" TRUMP SLAMS MEDIA AS 'CROOKED AS HELL' AMID UKRAINE PHONE CALL CONTROVERSY The president’s heated comments have come as congressional Democrats are pressing for a full disclosure of the whistleblower's complaint. Trump acknowledged Monday he didn't want to give money to Ukraine if there were corruption issues. His comments raised further questions about whether he improperly used his office to pressure the country into investigating the former vice president and his family. Hunter Biden  worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son. On "" The Five ,"" Williams backed the elder Biden's claim Trump is highlighting Hunter Biden's relationship to the natural gas company because he wants to fend off a potential general election challenge. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""I think Joe Biden is right,"" he said. ""Joe Biden sees that he is the target of Trump's ire because Trump sees -- as every poll indicates -- that Biden could 'beat him like a drum'."" Earlier, Biden used the description in his own critique of the president. ""Trump's doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum,"" he told reporters in Iowa over the weekend. ""And, he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to do something to smear me."" The whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he  privately threatened then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko  that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired. “I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion,'""  Biden recounted telling Poroshenko  at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here, in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'"" “Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. Fox News' Gregg Re and Andrew O'Reilly contributed to this report."
"The deals in question took place while Joe Biden was vice president and conducting official government business in those countries; Doug McKelway reports from Washington. WASHINGTON -- In June, two months after  Joe Biden  launched his  2020 campaign for president , The New Yorker published what many saw as a pre-emptive inoculation against his son's many troubles that might damage Biden’s campaign. In the piece , the recovering Hunter Biden acknowledged a longtime addiction to cocaine and alcohol. He also acknowledged frequenting prostitutes, and having other marital difficulties. The New Yorker also detailed Hunter's two questionable business deals, including a $1.5 billion donation from a Chinese businessman to a private equity firm, BHR Partners, on whose board Hunter sat. UKRAINE CONTROVERSY TURNS INTO DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR BIDEN ""Hunter became an unpaid member of BHR’s board but did not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after his father left the White House,"" The New Yorker said. The president's attorney,  Rudy Giuliani , maintained in a  fiery accusation on Fox News  Sunday that the money was donated days after the younger Biden flew with his father to China aboard Air Force Two. ""When he comes back ... eight days later, the kid gets a billion dollars in his ridiculous private equity fund run by a recovering drug addict,"" he said. President Trump has faced a whirlwind of criticism following accusations that he tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family dealings, using military aid as leverage. But the controversy has also renewed scrutiny on the Biden family's questionable business dealings. A second private equity firm founded by Biden received $3.4 million from a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings. Burisma Holdings also paid Hunter up to $50,000 a month to sit on its board. GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN Giuliani said when Ukrainian prosecutors  investigated Burisma Holdings for corruption, then-Vice President Joe Biden pressured the government to fire its head prosecutor. ""When Biden got the prosecutor fired, the new prosecutor who Biden approved -- you don’t get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country unless something fishy is going on -- the new prosecutor dropped the case,"" Giuliani said. The Biden camp maintains Giuliani is wrong -- that Biden, as well as other Western leaders and the International Monetary Fund, wanted the prosecutor fired because he wasn't aggressive enough in investigating the pro-Russian head of Ukraine's natural resources ministry, Mykola Zlochevsky, who also secretly headed Burisma Holdings through shell companies. It was only after the Ukraine government changed hands in a popular anti-Russian uprising that Hunter Biden was appointed to the board. There wasn't a hint ""of scandal at all when we were there and I impose the same strict rules,"" Joe Biden said last August. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Separately, Joe Biden's brother, James Biden, is also  being sued for conspiracy  to defraud a business partner. ""James Biden repeatedly would try to leverage his brother Joe Biden's connections ... connections to the court systems, connections to labor unions, connections to the Department of Veterans Affairs with the hopes that ... he could get my clients lucrative contracts. But none of these promises were fulfilled,"" the plaintiff’s attorney Robert Peal, told Fox News. An attorney representing James Biden did not respond to Fox News' request for a response. Joe Biden and his family have denied any impropriety. ""I have never discussed with my son or my brother or anyone else anything having to do with our businesses. Period,"" Joe Biden said in August. The New Yorker reported in its June piece that Hunter Biden declined a second term on Burisma Holdings' board, and that his decision to serve on the board during a first term was a mistake. ""It certainly wasn’t worth the grief,” he said. ""I would never have been able to predict that Donald Trump would have picked me out as the tip of the spear against the one person they believe can beat them.”"

According to  TMZ , police obtained five videos from surveillance cameras which showed she was driving the boat at 17 mph around 11:30 p.m., which police told the outlet is not a safe speed.

Police told Fox News that the penalty for that is a ticket, but could not confirm how much the ticket is for. A man identified as Gary Poltash, 64, died at the scene and a woman identified as Susanne Brito, 48, died of her injuries shortly after being taken to the hospital. The accident took place on Lake Joseph. 'SHARK TANK' STAR DESTROYS BERNIE SANDERS' $15 MINIMUM WAGE PLAN The “Shark Tank” star issued a statement following the accident. “Late Saturday night I was a passenger in a boat that had a tragic collision with another craft that had no navigation lights on and then fled the scene of the accident,” he said in a statement to  TMZ  at the time."
"A handful of Democrats who have spent Trump's presidency warning against the consequences of a distracting impeachment inquiry have used the latest allegations -- where Trump  admitted  to discussing his possible 2020 political rival Joe Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- to signal a ""tipping point."" While most left some wiggle room in their stance on impeachment, Democratic Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota issued a statement saying she is ""immediately"" calling for proceedings. ""We must safeguard our electoral process and our very democracy from outside threats. For this reason, the current investigations into corruption must continue. And when there is an abuse of power of this magnitude, it is our responsibility to stand up for what is right. This is why I am calling to open impeachment proceedings -- immediately, fairly, and impartially."" In a  Washington Post op-ed published Monday night,  seven freshman Democrats wrote that ""if these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense."" ""We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly, and we call on our colleagues in Congress to consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us, including the power of 'inherent contempt' and impeachment hearings, to address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security,"" the op-ed read.  The move by the freshman Democrats -- Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia -- marks a notable escalation from a group of lawmakers who are vulnerable in the 2020 election. Crow had previously called for an impeachment inquiry earlier in the summer, but the other lawmakers were signaling their potential openness for the first time. Sherrill said on CNN's ""New Day"" Tuesday that ""none of us ran on impeaching the President"" and noted her concern that impeachment would shift focus from her constituents' needs, citing fixes to health care and taxes. ""Quite frankly, in my district, it is not enough to impeach the President. In fact, many people probably won't agree with my decision,"" Sherrill said. But she argued that the allegation that Trump might have tried leveraging foreign military aid to advance his reelection efforts ""crossed a line"" for her and the six other freshmen Democrats. ""I think we all understood the implications of this right away. Many of us, if not all of us, have worked overseas. We've worked with foreign governments. We've worked to protect our national security and democracy, so this was a red line. We coalesced on this very quickly,"" Sherrill said of the group's decision to pen the op-ed. Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he discussed Biden in a July call with Ukraine's president. CNN  has previously reported  that Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the inspector general of the intelligence community in August. The complaint hasn't been shared with lawmakers, despite Democratic calls for the acting director of national intelligence to comply with a legal requirement to do so. Rep. Vincente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who has thus far resisted calling for Trump's impeachment, told CNN on Monday that he would reconsider his position if the administration  does not turn over the whistleblower complaint  regarding the President and Ukraine to the House Intelligence Committee this week. Speaking to CNN's Poppy Harlow on Monday, Gonzalez said if Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for a reopening of an investigation into Biden's son, he would support an impeachment inquiry. Trump has admitted to discussing Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son, Hunter. ""I don't think we have a choice under the Constitution. We must move forward with impeachment proceedings. I don't think we'll have much of a choice,"" Gonzalez said.  Gonzalez reiterated his stance in statement to CNN following the interview, saying he would ""seriously consider joining the calls to open an impeachment inquiry"" if the complaint isn't handed over. Rep. Dean Phillips, a Minnesota freshman Democrat who has also not embraced impeachment, said Monday that Democrats ""must pursue articles of impeachment and report them to the full House of Representatives for immediate consideration"" if reports about the whistleblower complaint are corroborated.  ""This continues a pattern of behavior that is corrupt at best, treasonous at worst, and puts our rule of law at risk,"" Phillips said in a statement. ""Our Constitution transcends any person, politician, or political party, and I call on the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Judiciary Committees to use every legal mechanism possible to obtain all relevant evidence."" And Rep. Stephen Lynch, a Massachusetts Democrat who has long pushed against pursuing impeachment, separately said on Monday that the complaint could lead to impeachment, calling the situation ""deeply concerning.""  ""If fully substantiated, it will be of momentous consequence, including the possibility of initiating impeachment proceedings,"" Lynch said in a statement. As recently as last month, he was  arguing  that conducting impeachment proceedings would hand Trump another four years in the White House. In a news release Monday night, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, said she has been reluctant to call for impeachment, but ""these actions regarding the 2020 election are a turning point."" Impeachment, she said, ""may be the only recourse Congress has"" if Trump is enlisting foreign help in the 2020 election. RELATED: House Democrats near 'tipping point' on impeachment as Pelosi faces crucial week Their comments came after House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff  told  CNN's Jake Tapper over the weekend that Trump may have ""crossed the Rubicon"" and impeachment could be ""the only remedy"" equal to the offense. The controversy surrounding Trump's dealings with Ukraine has added fuel to already-heated discussions among Democrats about whether to pursue impeachment. The House Judiciary Committee is conducting an investigation to determine whether or not to recommend articles of impeachment, but Democratic leaders are  divided  about the issue. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has thus far resisted calls to launch such proceedings over concern that an impeachment push would be dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate and would imperil Democrats' 2020 election chances. Pelosi,  in a letter  to all members of Congress over the weekend, said that the standoff could escalate Democrats' ongoing investigation into Trump. ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" she wrote. But some lawmakers say they are hearing from constituents who want to see Democrats take action beyond just more investigation, and soon. ""Phones have been ringing all day with constituents calling to tell me they support impeachment, particularly following the President's corrupt dealings with Ukraine,"" Virginia Rep. Don Beyer  wrote  on Twitter Monday. ""They are right."" This story has been updated with additional developments Monday."
"Reaction and analysis from American Center for Law and Justice executive director Jordan Sekulow. Editor’s note: Peter Schweizer and the Government Accountability Institute spent three years investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter and their dealings in the Ukraine and China. The research culminated in the #1 New York Times  bestselling book  “Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends” (Harper Collins, March 2018). Below are some of the results of the investigation.  1.  Joe Biden’s  son, Hunter Biden, joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma in April 2014, according to RSB bank records. Hunter Biden had little background in energy. Over a 16-month period, Burisma paid $3.1 million to a bank account associated with Hunter’s business. 2.  Joe Biden led  the Obama administration’s policy toward Ukraine when he served as vice president. Biden helped shape Ukraine’s energy and anti-corruption policies, issues that directly  impact Burisma . 3. Burisma sought to capitalize Hunter Biden’s name and relationships.  According to The New York Times , Hunter Biden helped assemble the company’s legal team, which consisted of American attorneys and consulting firms, including a former Obama Justice Department official. PETER SCHWEIZER: TRUMP RIGHT TO QUESTION BIDEN DEALINGS WITH UKRAINE, DESPITE DEM CRITICISM 4. Burisma is led by an oligarch named Mykola Zlochevsky. Zlochevsky served as ecology minister under pro-Russia former Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovich,  leading to allegations  that he used his office to benefit Burisma. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER 5. Burisma was under legal scrutiny. Shortly before Hunter Biden was appointed to Burisma’s board, British authorities  froze $23 million  of Zlochevsky’s assets as part of a corruption investigation. Ukraine opened  its own probe  later that year. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP 6. Financial records from Morgan Stanley show numerous lines of money going into the account of “Robert H. Biden.” The funds originated from oligarchs and anonymous LLCs in Ukraine, China, Kazakhstan and elsewhere. 7. In 2013, then-Vice President Biden and his son Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two to China. Ten days later, Hunter Biden’s firm scored a $1.5 billion deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government’s Bank of China. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY PETER SCHWEIZER"
"""As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid. But my complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they're not doing it,"" Trump said Tuesday as he arrived at the United Nations ahead of his speech to the General Assembly. Trump  remained defiant Tuesday that he's done nothing wrong  and has no regrets about his behavior when it comes to Ukraine and seeking an investigation into Biden's son's dealings. On Monday,  The Washington Post first reported  that the  President had directed his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney  to freeze nearly $400 million of US military and security aid to Ukraine in the days before he spoke with Zelensky. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Later Tuesday, when pressed again on why he blocked aid to Ukraine ahead of the call, Trump emphasized that other countries should contribute and noted that the aid was ultimately paid.  ""Nobody has given, I believe, more to Ukraine ... We think it is very important. And by the way, I don't know if you know it or not but that payment was made,"" Trump said during a bilateral meeting with embattled British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""But I wanted to get other countries -- other countries should also pay because, frankly, it affects them more,"" the President added. Trump said he took these concerns to acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.  Other countries should contribute, Trump said, which he claimed led to the delay in Ukraine aid. ""So I said hold it up. Let's get other people to pay. And then everybody called me, 'Oh please, can we pay?' And there was never any quid pro quo,"" he said.  Asked his reaction to the growing momentum toward impeachment, Trump again borrowed a phrase from his characterization of the Mueller investigation: ""Witch hunt."" ""I think it's ridiculous, it's a witch hunt. I'm leading in the polls. They have no idea how they stop me, the only way they can try is through impeachment. This has never happened to a president before,"" Trump claimed. He was again unclear on whether a transcript of the call would be released -- and when. ""It's nonsense and when you see the call, when you see the readout of the call, which I assume you'll see at some point, you'll understand. That call was perfect, it couldn't have been nicer,"" Trump said. A readout was released shortly after the call took place. He also again went after Biden without offering specifics or evidence. ""Even the Ukrainian government put out a statement that that was a perfect call, there was no pressure put on them whatsoever. But there was pressure put on with respect to Joe Biden. What Joe Biden did for his son, that's something they should be looking at,"" Trump said."
"Fox Nation hosts Diamond &amp; Silk come to President Trump's defense on 'Fox &amp; Friends.' Fox Nation's   Diamond & Silk  weighed in on former NBA player  Charles Barkley  slamming  Democrats'  for their lack of action in the black community and accusing them of taking the black vote for granted. ""Let me just tell you this here, when it comes to Democrats listening, they promise on everything and they deliver on nothing,"" said Diamond on  ""Fox & Friends."" TRUMP TOUTS HISTORICALLY LOW LEVEL OF AFRICAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT Diamond also blasted some Democrats for pushing for reparations for African-Americans, which has recently become a talking point amongst 2020 Democrats. ""Look at how they're promising reparations, black people don't need reparations, they need liberation from the Democrat party,"" Diamond said. The duo agreed largely with Barkley, who went after Democrats for allegedly only paying attention to black voters around election time. CHARLES BARKLEY JOKES ABOUT JUSSIE SMOLLETT, LIAM NEESON CONTROVERSIES DURING TNT'S NBA HALFTIME SHOW ""They’ve been taking black people’s votes – and they only talk to black people every four years. All of these politicians only talk to black people every four years because they want their vote,"" Barkley  said  in an interview aired Wednesday. He added that he thought Republicans didn't talk to black voters and that Democrats did ""nothing in the four years in between."" ""Fox & Friends"" host Brian Kilmeade agreed with Barkley, and called on Republicans to further their efforts in the black community, but Diamond and Silk pointed to President Trump's actions in response. ""When it comes to the Republican party, we have a Republican president. He's not all talk, he takes action,"" Diamond said, referencing the  historically low black unemployment rate  and Trump's commitment to the  First Step Act. ""So...Republicans don't have to pander, because they deliver...our Republican president...is delivering,"" she continued. Silk said she hoped black people would have a ""come to Jesus moment"" and that they would ""realize that the Democrat party mean black people no good."" Reiterating Diamond's support for Trump, Silk said the president is helping the black community by ""leading by example."" ""The president is doing what he needs to do when it comes down to black people by showing people this is what you need for the black community."" ""You need jobs so you can take care of your family,"" Silk continued, ""instead of talking about it, he's 'being about it,'  and that's why black people are waking up to it.""

"The announcement marks the most direct step taken by the House Democratic leader to embrace impeachment proceedings and is a significant escalation in the fight between House Democrats and the President. ""Today, I am announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,"" Pelosi said in a brief speech in the Capitol, adding, ""The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law."" ""Actions taken to date by the President have seriously violated the Constitution,"" the House speaker said. The House speaker, who has long pushed to keep her caucus away from the politically divisive issue, is responding to the seismic shift among Democratic members, following Trump's admission of discussing Vice President Joe Biden and his son in his phone call with the Ukrainian President. Dozens of House Democrats -- many from moderate or Trump-won districts -- have announced their support for an impeachment inquiry over the past 48 hours.  ""This week, the President has admitted to asking the President of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically. The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said in her public remarks.  In advance of that statement, Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer also announced plans to vote on a resolution of disapproval on Wednesday for allegations ""that the President of the United States sought to enlist a foreign government to interfere in our democratic process by investigating one of his political rivals -- and may have used the withholding of Congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance days earlier as intimidation."" Their statement did not mention impeachment. 'Full speed ahead' Pelosi consulted Tuesday afternoon with the six House Democratic leaders to discuss their presentation to the caucus later in the day, Democratic sources familiar with the issue said. In that closed-door meeting before her public announcement, Pelosi said the six chairmen will continue to investigate under a powerful new umbrella of an impeachment inquiry.  A separate source in the room said the speaker added, ""Here we are. A moment of truth. Truth is what this has been about all along.""  ""He's taken it to another level of betrayal therefore we're moving forward with another level of inquiry,"" Pelosi said.  Behind the scenes, Pelosi has encouraged members of her caucus to state their impeachment position now in order to show there is a groundswell in the caucus. She is also conveying that message to freshmen. On Tuesday, Pelosi also told the caucus that the impeachment inquiry will be done ""expeditiously,"" but wasn't specific in her timeframe, according to a source in the room. Rep. Jackie Speier told CNN that the President's actions in regards to Ukraine were so egregious, that there has been a ""dramatic"" shift by Pelosi. ""I think she's very laser-focused on this offense as being so egregious that it warrants a full blown impeachment inquiry,"" she said. Asked what the timeline is for this, she said, ""swiftly.""  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said on Tuesday after Pelosi's remarks, ""I only have one thing to say, full speed ahead."" Tide changing for Pelosi allies and vulnerable House freshmen Civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis on Tuesday announced his support for impeachment proceedings, arguing that ""now is the time to act"" and any delay ""would betray the foundation of our democracy."" ""We will never find the truth unless we use the power given to the House of Representatives and the House alone to begin an official investigation as dictated by the Constitution,"" the Georgia Democrat  said in a speech on the House floor . ""The future of our democracy is at stake."" Some of Pelosi's closest allies, including House Reps. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Debbie Dingell of Michigan, have signaled their support for impeachment proceedings — a significant indicator that the speaker could be moving closer to backing the divisive political procedure. Another crucial development has been multiple high profile freshmen Democrats in districts Trump won in 2016 either coming out publicly to fully endorse the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry or at least  opening the door to proceedings , citing Trump's actions as forcing them to act.  One of those freshman Democrats, Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, stressed on CNN ""New Day"" Tuesday that ""none of us ran on impeaching the President."" But she argued that the allegation that Trump might have tried leveraging foreign military aid to advance his reelection efforts was ""just a line that I think was too much for all of us."" Pelosi has cited the House members in GOP-leaning districts as part of her hesitance to embrace impeachment, and the groundswell of statements over the past 48 hours could signal a tipping point in the political calculus.  ""If investigations confirm recent reports, these actions represent impeachable offences that threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections and jeopardize the balance of power within the federal government,"" Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan said in a statement Tuesday. Stevens had told  CNN last month  that she had ""mixed reviews from the people of my district"" on the issue of whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings.  So far, as many as  165 House Democrats  have publicly stated their support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, according to a CNN count, and that doesn't include the House Democrats who've said in recent days that the President's behavior is a turning point in Democrats' oversight into the administration.  Pelosi has, for months, resisted pursuing impeachment because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash.  Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a member of House Judiciary, told CNN on Tuesday morning that he believes articles of impeachment are ""inevitable"" and said there's a ""growing clamor throughout the Democratic caucus"" to deal with Trump's ""reckless and lawless"" behavior. Some holdouts remain But some vulnerable Democrats in 2020 are still treading cautiously on the issue. Rep. Ben McAdams of Utah told CNN on Tuesday that he's ""considering"" impeachment, but didn't want to discuss the issue further. ""Before making any judgments, I want to know the facts of what occurred between the President and Ukraine,"" McAdams said. ""I share Sen. (Mitt) Romney's view that If the President used his position to pressure a foreign power to dig up dirt on a rival for his own personal gain, it would be deeply troubling. I believe it would be a betrayal of the loyalty owed to our country and the Constitution."" Rep. Max Rose, another endangered House Democrat, told CNN that he has not moved off his opposition to impeachment, but argued that ""we have to get to the facts"" of the allegations. ""It is impossible to not take these allegations seriously. It is a national security matter,"" the New York Democrat said Tuesday on Capitol Hill, adding, ""It's incredibly serious ... what I'm not going to do is jump to make another declaration."" Asked if that meant he is opposed to moving ahead on impeachment, Rose said, ""My current position right now is clear, but that is not a justification to not take these points as seriously as possible."" Rep. Susan Wild stood up during the Democratic caucus meeting on Tuesday and argued that Pelosi should cancel some of the upcoming two week recess to not lose momentum, according to a source in the room. The House, at the end of the week, will recess for two weeks for a district work period over the Yom Kippur and Columbus Day holidays. CNN  previously reported  that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation.  There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. That call was also part of a  whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, which hasn't been shared with lawmakers despite calls from Democrats.  Trump  acknowledged on Sunday  that he discussed the former Vice President Joe Biden in a phone call over the summer with Ukraine's president, but denied doing anything improper. CNN confirmed that Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before a call with Zelensky, two senior administration officials said on Monday. The  Washington Post  first reported this. In her public remarks on Tuesday, Pelosi said, ""The law is unequivocal: it says the DNI, director of national intelligence, shall provide congress the full whistleblower complaint,"" Pelosi said. Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee approved a resolution defining the rules of the panel's impeachment investigation. That vote came, however, as Democrats struggled to publicly define the committee probe with Nadler saying the committee is conducting an impeachment inquiry, while Pelosi and other Democratic leaders had refrained from calling it that. In a nod to the ongoing investigations in the House, Pelosi said on Tuesday, ""For the past several months we have been investigating in our committees and litigating in the courts so that the House can gather all the relevant facts and consider whether to exercise its full Article I powers, including a constitutional power of the utmost gravity, approval of articles of impeachment."" The House Speaker also said in her speech, ""I can say with authority the Trump administration's actions undermine both our national security and our intelligence and our protections of whistleblowers."" This story is breaking and will be updated."
"California Republican Rep. Devin Nunes on the whistleblower complaint against Trump, the IG report on alleged FISA abuse and privacy concerns with big tech. California  Rep. Devin Nunes  predicted on Fox News'  ""Sunday Morning Futures""  that  Joe Biden's  campaign is likely coming to an end -- all because of newly resurfaced reports about his  possible misconduct in Ukraine  that ""first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race."" The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee made the claim as  The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll  showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren  surging ahead of Biden  as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. Biden held a 9-point lead over Warren in the poll as recently as June. Nunes, speaking to anchor Maria Bartiromo, said a whistleblower's allegation that President Trump had acted inappropriately during a July 25 phone call with  Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelensky will ultimately backfire, and shine a light on Biden's own possible misconduct. CNN later  acknowledged  that the whistleblower had no first-hand knowledge of the call, and a top  Ukrainian  official on Saturday  defended Trump's  actions. FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED ""These stories first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race,"" Nunes said. ""So now that these have been resurrected, I don’t know who came up with the scheme -- maybe this whistleblower really is not a partisan. We want to hear from that whistleblower, but it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And, like I said, it looks like this is the end of Biden’s campaign. I really do... his lead is basically down to zero."" Late Sunday, Trump echoed Nunes' comments, and emphasized that Biden recently  bragged  about pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor when he was vice president. At the time, the prosecutor was probing a company closely linked to Biden's son, Hunter. ""Sleepy Joe Biden ... forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""That's the real story!"" Nunes said the ever-deepening schism in the Democratic Party over whether to impeach the president -- highlighted late Saturday when New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  called it a major ""scandal"" that Democrats hadn't yet voted to impeach  -- would help Trump in 2020. ""The more I think that they’re out there promoting this kind of craziness and silliness, the more that the American people are put off, and the more likely President Trump is reelected,” Nunes added. There were parallels, Nunes said, with Democrats' ultimately debunked claims that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. ""This has all the hallmarks of the Russia hoax,"" Nunes said. ""Something leaks out. ... and then it's the same reporters that report on it, the same reporters that reported on the Russia hoax. Then you move forward, and what happens? Then supposedly they come and testify -- and the night before they testify, the whistleblower who supposedly doesn't want anybody to know who this person is, or what information they have, well, it's spilled all over the pages of the Washington Post"" the day before Congress was briefed on the matter. WATCH: LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS NO ONE HAS REALLY LOOKED INTO BIDENS AND THEIR DEALINGS IN UKRAINE ""Whoever came up with this scheme -- it looks like somebody was trying to deflect what Biden did back in 2015,"" Nunes said. ""This scheme seems to have backfired on Biden. I mean, Biden's already dropping in the polls.""

       The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump had repeatedly asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son who had a key role in a natural gas firm that was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor as part of a corruption probe. At a conference two years after he left office, Joe Biden  openly boasted  about successfully pressuring Ukraine to  fire that prosecutor  when he was vice president. Unverified reports  circulated on left-leaning media outlets  claiming that Trump could have even promised something improper in exchange for Ukraine's compliance, although the Journal reported there was no ""quid-pro-quo"" involved. Trump  acknowledged Sunday  that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned ""the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."" However, the president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS THERE WAS NO PRESSURE DNI Inspector General Michael Atkinson said in a Sep. 9 letter to the House Intelligence Committee that the whistleblower complaint ""appeared credible"" and related to an ""urgent"" matter. But the DNI general counsel said days later that, after consulting with the DOJ, the matter did not meet the legal definition of an “urgent concern,"" and was not subject to mandatory disclosure to Congress. “Furthermore, because the complaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community, the DNI lacks unilateral authority to transmit such materials to the intelligence committees,”  Jason Klitenic, the DNI general counsel, wrote. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday. ""At that time, we expect him to obey the law and turn over the whistleblower’s full complaint to the Committee,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement Sunday afternoon. ""We also expect that he will establish a path for the whistleblower to speak directly to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as required by law.""

       Pelosi also seemingly threatened that she would back impeachment if her demands were not met, in a potentially major shift to her wait-and-see approach thus far: ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation."" Trump's conversation came as the White House was holding up $250 million in military aid for Ukraine. The president has said he wants European countries to pay more for their own defense, and  denied delaying any military aid funding. The whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he  privately threatened then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko  that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired. “I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'"" “Well, son of a b-tch, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.” It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. And earlier this year, The Hill  reported  that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros.

       Then, in April, Ukrainian law enforcement officials said they had a  slew of evidence of collusion and wrongdoing by Democrats , and that they have been trying to share this information with U.S. officials in the Justice Department. A  2017 investigation by Politico  found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory. Trump  told Fox News  that the allegations of possible Clinton-Ukraine collusion were ""big"" and vowed they would be reviewed by the DOJ. Additionally, attention focused anew on  President Obama's hot-mic comment to then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev  at a nuclear disarmament summit in March 2012, in which Obama was overheard saying he would have more ""flexibility"" to negotiate with Russia after the November 2012 election. ""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who believe Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy. Meanwhile, Biden on Saturday denied he has ever spoken to Hunter about his business in Ukraine and called Trump's actions an ""overwhelming abuse of power."" “Trump’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum, and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,” Biden  told reporters in Iowa . But Trump, on Sunday, pointed out that Biden's claim was seemingly inaccurate. Hunter Biden told the  New Yorker  previously that he and his father had spoken “just once” about it. “And now he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,” Trump said. “Of course you spoke to your son!” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump added: ""No quid pro quo, there was nothing. It was a perfect conversation. ... The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems. The new president is saying that he's going to be able to rid the country of corruption, and I said that would be a great thing, we had a great conversation."" Trump went on to say the latest allegations are ""just as ridiculous as the others,"" branding it ""the Ukraine Witch Hunt"" — a nod to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. ""Will fail again!"" Trump tweeted. Fox News' Ronn Blitzer, Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Trump tweets that the American people will see it was a 'very friendly and totally appropriate call' with 'no quid pro quo!' MSNBC host Chris Hayes isn’t sure  Americans can trust the transcript  of  President Trump’s  controversial call with Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky , so he turned to Twitter to smear it in advance. Trump announced on Tuesday that he would release the full transcript of the call, in which they reportedly discussed an investigation involving 2020 Democratic hopeful Joe Biden's kin. But the liberal pundit pre-emptively raised doubts about the transcript's veracity, because of how the president “pressures and manipulates” his staff. “Given what we know about how Trump pressures and manipulates civil servants to toe his line, I'm not *quite* sure we can trust the transcript itself as being accurate/comprehensive,” Hayes tweeted on Tuesday. NBC, COMCAST SILENT ON LAWRENCE O’DONNELL’S RETRACTED REPORT THAT BYPASSED MSNBC’S VERIFICATION PROCESS NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News he isn’t surprised that an anti-Trump cable news host would attempt to discredit the transcript in advance -- just in case it turns out to help the president fend off a whistleblower's allegations. “One of the most time-honored traditions in the liberal media is the moving of the goalposts when their adversaries and/or enemies do the very thing they've been asking for. Now that the president is going to be releasing the ‘complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of his phone call, the stampede of excuses were petty and sad but, again, predictable,” Houck told Fox News. “One of the most time-honored traditions in the liberal media is the moving of the goalposts when their adversaries and/or enemies do the very thing they've been asking for."" 
      MSNBC’s Chris Hayes is concerned that President Trump will release an inaccurate transcript.
       Earlier on Tuesday Trump announced that a transcript of his July phone call would be made public on Wednesday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,"" Trump wrote. ""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!"" Trump added: ""The Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it, including legislation on gun safety, lowering of prescription drug prices, infrastructure, etc. So bad for our Country!"" Fox News’ Gregg Re contributed to this report."
"""There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country,"" Omar said after she gave a keynote address at a candidates forum in Iowa, according to a report from  The Guardian  published Saturday. ""And I would say (Biden) is not one of them.""  ""I think it has been very clear to many of the people who have been creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations, that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have, and he doesn't,"" the Minnesota lawmaker added, according to the paper. Omar's office confirmed the comments to CNN. The comments from the progressive congresswoman were made as a number of the  2020 Democratic candidates pitched themselves  this weekend in the first-in-the-nation caucus state as the best contender to take on President Donald Trump. Biden, the pack's centrist front-runner, has faced tough criticism from his fellow candidates for his record, which some have knocked as not being progressive enough. Support for Biden in the state  appeared to have waned this weekend  after a new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers found that the former vice president slipped 3 percentage points since June, while Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is known for her progressive, working-class-focused views, stood at 22% in the poll, up 7 percentage points since the last poll.   Next month, Biden may face more questions about how progressive his record is during  the fourth presidential debate,  hosted in Westerville, Ohio, by CNN and The New York Times. "
"2020 Republican presidential hopeful Bill Weld says he is not 'in love' with the job being done in Washington. Mark Levin  ripped  2020 Republican presidential candidate   William Weld  for claiming  President Trump  committed treason and suggesting he, therefore, face the death penalty over the  Ukraine controversy . Weld, a former Massachusetts governor and U.S. attorney in the Bay State, should be lambasted by all Americans for those comments, Levin said Monday on "" The Mark Levin Show on Westwood One ."" ""This should be an absolute controversy that William Weld just accused the president of treason – pure and simple – and then said the only penalty is 'death',"" he said. ""I worked with Bill Weld. Bill Weld is a conniving, unethical [person],"" Levin added, recalling the two men's time working in the Reagan Justice Department. Levin was chief of staff to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese and Weld was the head of the Criminal Division. BILL WELD SUGGESTS TRUMP COULD FACE EXECUTION OVER UKRAINE PHONE CALL Levin told his audience how Weld, then-Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns, and other top aides resigned, amid what he characterized as  an attempt to urge Reagan to fire Meese . ""And they failed... And he did all this to position himself to run for governor of Massachusetts. He's doing a similar thing against President Trump. The man is utterly unprincipled. And I'll prove it to you,"" he said playing a clip from Weld's appearance on MSNBC. On the network's ""Morning Joe"" program,  Weld claimed Trump  has ""now acknowledged that, in a single phone call right after he suspended $250 million of military aid to Ukraine, he called up the president of Ukraine and pressed him eight times to investigate Joe Biden."" ""Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election. It couldn’t be clearer, and that’s not just undermining democratic institutions. That is treason. It’s treason, pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death. That’s the only penalty."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Weld continued , remarking it could be a ""pretty good alternative"" for Trump to offer a ""plea"" for the Constitutional remedy instead: removal from office. Reacting to the clip, Levin further criticized Weld's character. ""Listen to this,"" he said. ""This is how sick this man is: 'The penalty of treason under the U.S. code is death'?"" ""He doesn't have a chance in Hell of getting one percent of the vote... This man wants to be president of the United States. He doesn't even qualify to be a host on MSNBC or CNN.""

       Nunes says whistleblower controversy could have unintended casualty: Joe Biden's 2020 campaign   
On Sunday, Trump addressed reports that a whistleblower complaint may have accused him of wrongdoing related to a July phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, and insisted that there was “absolutely nothing wrong” with the substance of the discussion. The president reportedly has been accused of asking Ukraine’s leader multiple times to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden’s son and using military aid as leverage. Trump denied making any improper requests,  but he did point fingers at Biden .

       The Democratic presidential hopeful’s son Hunter Biden had been investigated related to business interests. In the past, Joe Biden has said the U.S. would  withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired , but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to his son's case. Trump accused Biden of being dishonest in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling the New Yorker that they spoke “just once” about it. In an interview with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said the whistleblower complaint will have unintended consequences and  shine light on Joe Biden's own misconduct - and ultimately end his 2020 campaign . Amid AOC pressure, Pelosi suggests Trump impeachment back on the table because of whistleblower complaint 
Just hours after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said her party's failure so far to impeach President Trump amounted to a major ""national scandal,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared to relent on Sunday -- and  warn that a ""whole new stage of investigation"" could be approaching  because of the reported whistleblower complaint against the president. Pelosi, who has long resisted calls to impeach Trump because the move would imperil the electability of moderate Democrats in the House, the whistleblower who alleged Trump acted improperly in his phone call with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy must be allowed to speak to Congress, and the full whistleblower complaint must be provided.  Blackface scandal damages Trudeau at polls as he vows lower taxes, cellphone costs 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday worked to start putting last week’s blackface scandal behind him and focused on policies he said he’d pursue if re-elected, including lower cellphone costs and a middle-class tax cut, according to reports.  However, the scandal may have torpedoed his lead in the polls . Trudeau apologized several times for the multiple images that emerged last week showing him in blackface at different parties and events while he was in his teens and 20s. But pollster Frank Graves of EKOS Research told Reuters that polls have shifted and the gap between his campaign and the opposition Conservatives has narrowed. Graves said he will release the poll numbers later this week, but told the news outlet that Trudeau’s lead has “evaporated almost overnight.”

"Yes, Warren tops the field in the  CNN-DMR poll  with 22% support, followed by former Vice President Joe Biden at 20% (the poll has a four-point margin of error, putting the two essentially in a tie). Warren and Biden are followed distantly by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 11%.  But that doesn't tell the whole story: The topline numbers are actually the least good thing for Warren in the poll.  Consider this: * Warren gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now. * Her favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is behind her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders. * Warren is the first or second choice of 42% of those polled. That's well in front of Biden (30% first/second combined), Sanders (21%), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (18%) and California Sen. Kamala Harris (16%). Any one of those three data points would suggest that this poll may have only caught the start of Warren's rise in Iowa. All three together suggest she is well positioned to take off like a rocket ship in the state. Not only does she already have a broad-base of support in the state (as evidence by the topline numbers) but she also has significant passion among those who are for her and remains well-liked -- and a possible voting option -- for those who say she is their second choice at the moment. That's not even taking into account Warren's grassroots operation, which is widely regarded as the best -- by a lot -- of any campaign in Iowa.  Wrote the Des Moines Register on  Sunday: ""Elizabeth Warren's slow but steady rise in the first-in-the-nation caucus state is as much a result of her robust organizational presence here as it is a response to the Massachusetts senator's many plans and policies, Iowa experts say ... the (poll) results were not surprising, said several Iowa Democrats who have watched Warren build out a team that is widely credited with having the most sophisticated organizational presence in the state."" Add it all up and you get this: With 133 days left before the February 3 caucuses, Warren is the clear Iowa front-runner. There's simply no one else who can make anywhere near as strong a case -- either by polling or staff or both -- as Warren in the state. Now, OF COURSE, 133 days is a long time in politics. Things can change. If past is prologue, there will be a handful of up and downs within the top tier between now and February 3. But it's very clear from the polling trends that Iowa is now Warren's to lose.  If she does win it, then Warren would be in a great position heading into  New Hampshire, where she is running just behind both Biden and Sanders  at the moment. And if Warren wins both of the first two voting states, the field of remaining challengers is going to shrink. Rapidly."
"Despite major holes in The New York Times story, members of 'The Squad' are calling for Brett Kavanaugh's impeachment and other top Democrats are attacking the FBI's investigation into the allegations; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' The latest smear on Supreme Court Justice  Brett Kavanaugh  is a disaster for Democrats, and everyone seems to know it except the party's presidential candidates. No sooner had The New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, then most of the candidates demanded Kavanaugh's  impeachment . ""These newest revelations are disturbing,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter, adding ""Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."" RUSH LIMBAUGH: TREATMENT OF TRUMP BY DEMOCRATS, MEDIA HAS AMERICANS 'QUIETLY SEETHING' Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Kavanaugh's ""place on the court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached."" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Obama housing secretary Julián Castro and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke joined in with impeachment calls of their own. Even former Vice President Joe Biden demanded Congress open an investigation and ""follow the evidence to wherever it leads."" That was considered the restrained response in the Democratic field. Never mind that the supposed victim has told friends she has no recollection of the alleged incident; facts have never stood in the Democrats' way when it comes to Kavanaugh before. If the Democratic presidential contenders want to see  Kavanaugh  impeached, I say go for it. Open the investigation Biden has demanded. Start impeachment hearings. And broadcast it for all of America to see. Let's remind voters of the disgraceful confirmation process Kavanaugh faced. Let's relive how Democrats accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, exposing himself to a college classmate and participating in gang rapes at high school parties -- all without a shred of corroborating evidence. Let's rehash Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, but this time with the knowledge that the principal witness Ford named to her alleged assault, Leland Keyser, is now on record saying she does not believe Ford. Let's remind Americans how Senate Democrats denied Kavanaugh the presumption of innocence and insisted that the burden was on him to prove he was not a sexual predator. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER That sure worked out well for Democrats last time around. In 2018, the Kavanaugh debacle may have cost Democrats control of the Senate. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D.-Mo., lost their seats thanks to voters disgusted by their party's campaign of character assassination against Kavanaugh, while Democrats blew a chance to pick up GOP seats in Tennessee and Texas. As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at the time, the Kavanaugh hearings were ""like an adrenaline shot"" for the Republican base. Now, Democrats want to bring out the hypodermic needle for the 2020 elections. Sounds good to me. On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders know this a path to disaster. In a stunning rebuke of the party's presidential contenders, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told those calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment to ""get real."" ""We've got to get beyond this 'impeachment is the answer to every problem,'"" Durbin said. ""It's become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you're unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. ... If that's how we are identified ... we run the risk that people will feel we're ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was even more succinct. Asked if the House was going to investigate the new allegation, she said ""no."" Durbin and Pelosi understand that the threats to impeach Kavanaugh are a godsend for Trump. And they come in the wake of Senate Democrats issuing an unprecedented threat to the other Supreme Court justices. In a brief, they warned that if the high court does not rule as Democrats wish in a gun case, they could ""restructure"" the court when they take power in the 2020 elections -- packing it with liberal justices, flipping a 5-to-4 conservative majority to a liberal majority. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats do not seem to realize that when they make threats like these, they are not hurting Kavanaugh or Trump, they are hurting themselves. In 2016, 26 percent of Trump voters said Supreme Court nominees were the most important issue to them, while only 18 percent of Hillary Clinton's voters mirrored the sentiment. As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose. In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Kavanaugh or liberal court-packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should. So, let the impeachment proceedings begin. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MARC THIESSEN"

Sign up  here . ** On the roster: Warren surges in Iowa - Time Out: Meet you in St. Louis - Impeachment pressure builds around Trump phone call - Congress set to pass stopgap spending bill this week - Let’s get this bread WARREN SURGES IN IOWA  Des Moines Register:  “ Elizabeth Warren  has surged in Iowa, narrowly overtaking  Joe Biden  and distancing herself from fellow progressive  Bernie Sanders , the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows. Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register’s poll. Former Vice President Biden, who had led each of the Register’s three previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%. No other candidate reaches double digits. ‘This is the first major shakeup’ in what had been a fairly steady race, said  J. Ann Selzer , president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. … South Bend, Indiana, Mayor  Pete Buttigieg  follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen.  Kamala Harris  of California is at 6%. U.S. Sens.  Amy Klobuchar  of Minnesota and  Cory Booker  of New Jersey are at 3%. Polling at 2% are U.S. Rep.  Tulsi Gabbard  of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep.  Beto O’Rourke  of Texas, businessman  Tom Steyer  and entrepreneur  Andrew Yang .” Dem candidates take two approaches in Iowa -  Des Moines Register:  “Former Vice President Joe Biden brought in a fire truck, bouncy house and ice cream truck for a carnival-style ‘Biden fest.’ A Mariachi band played at former U.S. Housing Secretary  Juliàn Castro ’s rally site and then marched in with the candidate and his supporters. And  Lizzo  and  Prince  blared through the speakers at a gathering for U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. But others took a different tack: U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren focused on organizing supporters, gathering voter information and knocking doors rather than big displays of support. Saturday’s Polk County Steak Fry in Iowa was the largest in the event’s storied history, drawing more than 12,000 excited Democrats to Water Works Park, where they heard from 17 presidential candidates vying for their attention and support on caucus day. Many of the candidates gathered with their supporters ahead of the main event, holding rallies where they each tried to outshine their competitors.” Voters dislike Trump, still have doubts about Dems -  NBC News:  “As Democratic candidates compete for the opportunity to take on President  Donald Trump , the incumbent they hope to oust is more personally disliked than any of his recent predecessors, and half of voters say they’re very uncomfortable with the idea of his re-election. But the electorate at large also expresses doubts about some of the progressive policies being backed by candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and the party’s more moderate frontrunner — Joe Biden — also faces questions about his fitness for the job. Those are the major findings in the latest release from the September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll… But Trump also continues to benefit from the upside of the polarization of the electorate around him, commanding more enthusiasm than his Democratic competitors as well. A quarter of voters (26 percent) say they’re enthusiastic about him, while fewer say they’re enthusiastic about Warren (17 percent), Sanders (13 percent) and Biden (12 percent.)” The end may be near for Booker -  Politico:  “Cory Booker’s presidential campaign is betting it all on the next 10 days, signaling Saturday that it will cease to exist unless it can raise nearly $2 million by the end of the month. ‘We have reached a critical moment, and time is running out,’ campaign manager  Addisu Demissie  warned in a memo to Booker staff and supporters. ‘It’s now or never: The next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race and compete to win the nomination.’ The bottom line, Demissie said, is that ‘we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward’ if the campaign can’t raise another $1.7 million by Sept. 30, the third-quarter fundraising deadline. … Demissie made clear on a conference call with reporters later Saturday that the campaign isn’t out of money or at risk of running out of funds.” THE RULEBOOK: GOOD CALL GUYS  “For the sake of certainty and uniformity, therefore, the power of defining felonies in this case was in every respect necessary and proper.” –  James Madison ,  Federalist No. 42 TIME OUT: MEET YOU IN ST.

IMPEACHMENT PRESSURE BUILDS AROUND TRUMP PHONE CALL NYT:  “ President Trump  acknowledged on Sunday that he raised corruption accusations against former Vice President  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  during a phone call with Ukraine’s leader, a stunning admission as pressure mounted on Democrats to impeach Mr. Trump over allegations he leaned on a foreign government to help damage a political rival. In public and in private, many Democrats said the evidence that has emerged in recent days indicating that Mr. Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden, and his administration’s stonewalling of attempts by Congress to learn more, were changing their calculations about whether to charge him with articles of impeachment. … The fast-moving developments prompted Speaker  Nancy Pelosi  to level a warning of her own to the White House: Turn over the secret whistle-blower complaint by Thursday, or face a serious escalation from Congress. In a letter to House Democrats, Ms. Pelosi never mentioned the word ‘impeachment,’ but her message hinted at that possibility.” Trump continues to defend his call about Biden -  Politico:  “President Donald Trump on Monday intensified his attempts to justify a phone call with Ukraine’s president in which he reportedly pushed for an investigation into one of his chief political rivals, maintaining that he’s merely concerned about stamping out corruption. He once again dismissed the accusations that he was using his position of power to pressure a foreign government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son as a ‘witch hunt.’ For the first time, however, Trump appeared to connect the idea to the issue of foreign aid. ‘If we're supporting a country, we want to make sure that country is honest,’ Trump told reporters after arriving for the U.N. General Assembly. … Also at issue with critics of the president is $250 million in foreign aid meant for Ukraine that the White House mysteriously withheld before releasing under bipartisan pressure early this month. There is no evidence that Trump directly tied the release of foreign aid to an investigation into Biden and his son.” Schumer insists on hearings over whistleblower complaint -  Politico:  “Senate Minority Leader  Chuck Schumer  is requesting that the Republican Senate conduct hearings and issue a subpoena to the Trump administration in response to a whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump's alleged request that Ukraine investigate one of his political opponents. In a letter to Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell  (R-Ky.) on Monday morning, the New York Democrat said the Senate should hold hearings regarding any connection between delayed aid to Ukraine and Trump's reported request that the country probe the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender in next year's presidential election. Schumer also asks McConnell to compel the Senate to issue a subpoena to bring the whistleblower complaint to Congress ‘as required by law.’” Giuliani accuses Ukraine of laundering $3M to Hunter Biden -   Fox News:  “ Rudy Giuliani  channeled President Trump Monday with a wee-hours Twitter blitz aimed at turning the Ukraine story currently roiling Washington into a big problem for Democrats. Giuliani, the personal attorney for Trump and outspoken critic of presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son’s relationship with Ukraine, accused Kiev of laundering $3 million to  Hunter Biden , suggested that the Obama administration turned a blind eye, and made the prediction that the scandal is in its infancy. ‘If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,’ he tweeted. ‘Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?’” CONGRESS SET TO PASS STOPGAP SPENDING BILL THIS WEEK  Roll Call:  “The Senate needs to act this week to clear a stopgap spending bill before recessing through the end of the government’s fiscal year, but that is really the only must-pass business for either chamber. The House passed the measure Thursday, 301-123, after resolving hangups that included a debate over assisting farmers who have seen demand for crops plummet thanks to the ongoing sparring over trade with China. … There is no expectation the Senate will have trouble reaching an agreement to clear the measure to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, but it is certainly not the only piece of business that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to advance. … Once the House is back Tuesday, Democrats will once again turn their attention to border politics as the chamber considers two measures designed to improve the Department of Homeland Security’s treatment of migrants.” PLAY-BY-PLAY Check this out: Inside Fox News’ polling ‘nerdquarium’  -  LAT Team Trump growing more concerned about Michigan  -  Politico Rand Paul  interfering with  Liz Cheney  Senate run  -   Politico Alaska Republicans cancel 2020 presidential primary  -  Anchorage Daily News AUDIBLE: *MIC DROP* “So many people seem to think that judges are just like politicians with robes.

LET’S GET THIS BREAD UPI:  “A raccoon went for a 16-mile ride on top of a Florida bread delivery truck that reached speeds of over 50 mph during the trip. The driver of the Wonder Bread truck said other drivers called his attention to the raccoon on top of his truck, and he had already traveled about 10 miles before calling 911 from the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. Police and the driver attempted to get the raccoon to safety by pulling the truck up to a convenient tree branch, but the animal refused to climb down. The driver said he eventually had to drive the final 6 miles of his journey with the raccoon still riding on the roof. He said the animal eventually apparently climbed down on its own once the truck was parked at his company's headquarters in North Fort Myers.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “Over the past hundred years, Americans have elected 13 Republican Administrations and 12 Democratic ones.

"Klopfer died on September 3 and his family  was going through his belongings at his home  in Will County, about 45 miles from Chicago, when they found the medically preserved remains, authorities said. They were inside small, sealed plastic bags that contained a chemical used to preserve biological material, Will County Sheriff Mike Kelley told reporters at a news conference Thursday. They were in boxes that were mixed in with other storage boxes  ""I can tell you, the 31 years I've been doing this job, I have never seen anything like this, ever. It is a strange, one of those once-in-a-lifetime things,"" he said.  Klopfer operated three abortion clinics in South Bend, Indiana, before his license was suspended in 2015. County officials estimated how long the remains had been preserved but did not provide details on how they determined they were from nearly two decades ago. ""The condition they are in, it is clear that they are older,"" said James Glasgow, Will County state's attorney.  Klopfer did not follow Indiana law for disposal of the fetal remains and the filing of the proper paperwork, Glasgow said. The remains will be transferred to the custody of the Indiana attorney general.  An attorney representing the doctor's family called the Will County coroner's office on September 12 to inform them the family had discovered what appeared to be the remains of fetuses and asked for assistance in removing them, the Will County Sheriff's Office said. Detectives arrived at the address and the coroner's office took the remains. The family is cooperating with the investigation.  There is no evidence any medical procedures were conducted at the doctor's property, according to the sheriff's office.  Anti-abortion groups have gathered at the site of his former clinics to demand the identification and burial of the remains,  CNN affiliate WNDU reported.  One woman  told WNDU  that she was raped as a minor and had an abortion at one of Klopfer's clinics. ""For me, closure would be just know if my baby was on his property so that I can just have a proper burial,"" Serena Dyksen said.  South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, called for an investigation. ""Like everyone, I find the news out of Illinois extremely disturbing, and I think it's important that it be fully investigated,"" Buttigieg  said Wednesday . ""I also hope it doesn't get caught up in politics at a time when women need access to health care. There's no question that what happened is disturbing. It's unacceptable. And it needs to be looked into fully."""
"Here's what else you need to know to  Get Up to Speed and Out the Door . (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily.  Sign up here .) 1. Whistleblower scandal OK, this story is really complicated, so let's just start at the beginning. A whistleblower inside the intelligence community filed a complaint about communications between President Trump and a foreign leader. The whistleblower was alarmed by a ""promise"" Trump allegedly made to the foreign leader. The Democratically led House Intelligence Committee wants to see the complaint, but Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence, has blocked that. (He's set to testify before the committee next week.) The White House and Justice Department told the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  not to share the complaint  because they don't believe it's governed by laws covering intelligence whistleblowers, three sources told CNN. Then, yesterday the  Washington Post  and  New York Times  reported that the communications at the center of all this involved Ukraine. Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by phone in July. Some Trump supporters have  pushed for the Ukrainian government to open investigations  that the President could use to raise suspicions about his political rivals, including Joe Biden. Some observers wonder if there's a connection between the push for an investigation and Trump's call with Zelensky. But there's no public evidence that the whistleblower's complaint pertains to the Trump-Zelensky call. The potential ramifications of this story are starting to become more clear, CNN political analyst Stephen Collinson says, and the  risks facing the President, the intelligence community and Democrats  in Congress are climbing by the day.  Here are 5 key questions  about the whistleblower case. 2. Justin Trudeau Another day, another apology from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. After a  third incident emerged  of him  wearing brownface or blackface , he was forced to meet with reporters for the second day in a row to say he's sorry for wearing racist makeup. He also flat out said he doesn't remember how many times he's worn blackface. Trudeau, known for his uber-progressive views, insists he's still an ally in the fight for social justice. But this scandal  and other recent political hiccups  could mix to seriously threaten his chances at re-election next month. 3. Israel It's been three days since votes were cast in Israel's elections, and we  still don't know who will be leading the country . Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White party, declared victory because his party is projected to win a few more seats in Israel's legislature than Likud, the political party headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But Gantz won't have enough seats to govern. He'd probably have to form a coalition with Netanyahu to do that, and that's probably not going to happen. So, that brings up another possibility: Israel may have to have a third election to settle the political gridlock. 4. Weather The remnants of Tropical Storm Imelda are  pushing into northern Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana  today, dumping heavy rain along the way. The storm left quite the mess in southeast Texas, where some areas got more than 30 inches of rain. Flooding was so bad in Houston that  hundreds of cars were abandoned  after rising water made some roads impassable. Meanwhile, out in the Atlantic,  Hurricane Jerry has developed . It's a Category 1 storm right now and is expected to pass just north of the Leeward Islands today before moving north of Puerto Rico and the Bahamas over the weekend. 5. Climate strike If your co-worker or classmate isn't around today, it may not be because they're getting an early jump on the weekend. They could be on strike. Global climate strikes are taking place today all over the world, with people walking out of workplaces and classrooms  to demand action to address the climate crisis . It's expected to be the biggest day of climate demonstrations in history. More than  100,000 people gathered in Melbourne , Australia.

"Former Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign chief strategist Mark Penn reacts to the latest numbers. Former Vice President  Joe Biden’s  many gaffes don’t mean he’s mentally unfit to be president, but if they raise enough questions with voters they might prevent him from getting the Democratic presidential nomination, or from getting elected if he becomes the nominee. Biden, his two leading competitors in the Democratic presidential primaries and  President Trump  are all in their 70s. The oldest is Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 78, followed by Biden at 76, Trump at 73, and Sen. Elizabeth of Warren of Massachusetts at 70. Are all four too old for what is probably one of the most intellectually challenging jobs in the world, with enormous power over our lives and the future of the planet? FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN AT NEW LOW IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE Biden, Sanders, Warren and Trump all keep demanding and high-pressure schedules, traveling frequently, often getting little sleep, and speaking on an almost daily basis in front of TV cameras to answer questions from reporters and to address audiences large and small. That takes stamina and a quick mind. But because they speak in public so often and most of what they say is recorded, each of them sometimes generates news stories when saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. Biden, however, seems to exceed the average for the number of these gaffes. And because the former vice president’s frequent gaffes have now become an issue raising questions about his fitness to serve as president, they are getting outsized attention in the media and from his opponents. Still, at this early stage in the 2020 presidential race Biden remains the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. A  Fox News poll  that came out this week shows Biden has the support of 29 percent of likely Democratic primary voters, compared with 18 percent for Sanders and 16 percent for Warren. However, Biden’s solid lead was down by two points since August and six points since May. Biden has almost universal name recognition among voters from his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president and 36 years in the Senate before that. A centrist who doesn’t embrace the more far-left policies of Sanders and Warren, Biden has strong appeal for many voters because of his more moderate positions and because they believe he can make Trump a one-term president. But what about all the Biden gaffes? His critics are raising questions about his mental fitness and whether he could be suffering from the early stages of dementia that could grow markedly worse at the end of a potential two terms in the White House. So far the Democratic presidential candidate going after Trump most directly on the mental fitness issue is former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, who aggressively attacked Biden in the last presidential debate, accusing Biden of forgetting a comment he had made just minutes earlier. But it turns out that Castro was the one who forgot what Biden said. Does the fact that Castro got mixed up mean he is suffering from dementia? Look, dementia isn’t diagnosed by watching someone on a podium at a televised debate, where candidates are required to instantly respond to questions and sum up complex issues in a minute or less. And once in office, presidents have advisers and briefings and time to learn and think about issues. No one is ever going to say to a president: Sir (or someday Madam), tell me in 60 seconds how to end terrorism, or end poverty, or improve our educational system, or balance the federal budget. And when we look at Biden’s gaffes and question if he is possibly “losing it” or if he’s fit for office, we shouldn’t forget that President Trump certainly has made quite a few gaffes of his own. More importantly, according to The Washington Post’s  Fact Checker database , as of Aug. 5 Trump “had made 12,019 false or misleading claims.” “President Trump’s proclivity for spouting exaggerated numbers, unwarranted boasts and outright falsehoods has continued at a remarkable pace,” a Post article reported. Of course, the president and his supporters strongly dispute the Post tally, and the president regularly denounces the newspaper as biased against him and as purveying “fake news.” But if voters are concerned about instances where Biden gets a bit confused at times and inadvertently says the wrong thing, they should be even more concerned about Trump’s “false and misleading claims.” We all accidentally say the wrong thing sometimes and forget things or remember past events incorrectly. Those are innocent mistakes. And we all age differently. Some people are past their peak mental performance in their 60s and some even have dementia at that age. Others are just fine mentally in their 80s and even beyond. Space doesn’t permit a listing of all Biden’s gaffes, simply because there are so many. But importantly, he’s been making these gaffes for decades, going back to when he was a young man and in middle age. That hasn’t prevented him from devoting a lifetime to public service and accomplishing a great deal for the American people. But let’s look at just a few of Biden’s gaffes. Recently Biden has urged parents to keep “record players” on to improve the vocabulary of their children. He said he was in Vermont when he was really in New Hampshire. Biden said in August that he was still vice president at the time of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb.14, 2018 – when he had been out of office for more than a year.  An official with Biden’s campaign later said Biden had meant to refer to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, which occurred in December 2012. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER And one of Biden’s gaffes, which was a favorite for many and quite funny, came during CNN’s July 31 presidential debate, when he asked voters to “go to Joe 30330.” He said later he meant to say “text.” “I was so focused on making the case for Joe, I said ‘Joe’ and I gave the number,” he said. According to the Alzheimer’s Association: “There is no one test to determine if someone has dementia.  Doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia based on a careful medical history, a physical examination, laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day function and behavior associated with each type.” I’m not a doctor and I certainly can’t diagnose Biden’s mental abilities. But you would think if he really was slipping mentally his own doctors, his wife, other family members and the people who work with him every day would notice something was seriously wrong. And you would think Biden himself would notice and conclude for his own health and for the good of the country he deeply loves that he should withdraw from the presidential race – or resign from the presidency, should he become president and be stricken with dementia. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The bottom line is that opponents attack each other in campaigns. This has begun happening in the 2020 presidential race and is going to get a lot worse. As the Democratic front-runner, Biden is a magnet for attacks – as always happens with front-runners. My best advice to Biden is to focus on trying to reduce the number of gaffes he makes, working with his top advisers. He has an outstanding record in government and shouldn’t be pushed out of the race for slips of the tongue, as long as they don’t indicate he has more serious problems that make him unfit to be our next president.

"Democrats, activists offer doomsday climate scenarios. We hope you had a happy weekend. If you did, hold on to those memories. It might be the last relaxing moment you'll have for a while. We're about to wreck your peace of mind. It turns out that all is not well on this blue planet of ours, far from it. Indeed, it appears that the  Earth  itself is facing what we're going to call tonight, an existential threat from  climate change . Now, what does the term ""existential threat"" actually mean, you ask? Honestly, we don't know. But it sounds absolutely terrifying. CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTS SNARL DC TRAFFIC AS BIZARRE SCENES UNFOLD IN CAPITAL Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., presidential candidate: The climate change is real. It is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet. Sen. Cory Booker , D-N.J., presidential candidate: If NATO is about the common defense, the biggest existential threat is climate change. Former Vice President Joe Biden , presidential candidate: This is climate change. It really is the existential threat. Julian Castro , presidential candidate: We're going to have to address the most existential threat to our nation and the world, climate change. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Beto O'Rourke , presidential candidate: On climate change, the greatest existential threat that we face. Sen. Kamala Harris , D-Calif., presidential candidate: We are facing a climate crisis, it represents an existential threat to who we are as human beings. ""A threat to who we are as humans."" Well, there are a number of questions here. Let's see if we can unpack them. The first one: is climate change real? That's an easy one. Of course, it's real. Climate always changes. If you're in the United States, for example, the ground that you're standing on right now was not so long ago really covered with glacial ice a mile thick. Now, it's not covered in glacial ice a mile thick. So what happened? What happened is climate change. That's been happening since the Earth cooled. Is human activity accelerating climate change? Can we reverse or slow climate change? Despite what they tell you, no one really knows. But the real question here has nothing to do with climate science. It has to do with people who pretend they understand climate science. Do those people actually believe what they're saying? This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets. Well, let's see. Here was Kamala Harris recently  talking at a CNN town hall  about how red meat contributes to the absolutely existential threat of climate change. Harris: As a nation, we have actually have to have a real priority at the highest level of government around what we eat and in terms of healthy eating, because we have a problem in America. Erin Burnett, CNN host: But would you support changing the Dietary Guidelines? Harris: Yes. Burnett: You know, the food pyramid, what people are eating? Harris: Yes. Burnett: So reduce red meat specifically. Harris: Yes, I would. Got that? Kamala Harris is a good person, and because she is a good person -- a much better person than you are -- she cares about the existential threat of climate change so much, that she is willing to forgo red meat. That's what she told CNN viewers recently. But when she is in the pork producing state of Iowa, though, it's a very different story. Just this past weekend, Harris attended the Annual Polk County Democratic Party Steak Fry. She took her turn working the grill posing for the cameras. And by the way, so did  all of the other Democratic candidates .  Liz Warren  was there, Beto O'Rourke, even Cory Booker, who says he is a vegan. Organizers grilled more than 10,000 steaks over the weekend. Tape of the event shows plumes of ozone destroying meat smoke rising heavenward. The candidates standing amidst all of this seemed wholly unconcerned. Are you surprised? Don't be surprised. This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets. No one says a word about it. Last week, millions of concerned progressives took part in the so-called climate strike. In their wake, they left mountains of litter. On Monday in Washington, climate activists demanded change by blocking roads, causing gridlock, and throwing confetti on the ground. Well, if you're under 40, you might be surprised to learn that people didn't use to express concern about the environment by littering. That used to seem weird, but then the point of environmentalism used to be about nature and preserving it and protecting it. The point now is very different. The point now is political power. You gin up a crisis and you demand the population submit to your will, or else. And as you do that, of course, you don't need to fight fair or acknowledge democracy or make a rational case for your position. You do whatever it takes. You'll even use children, if it helps. Just today, for example, a 16-year-old Swedish girl named Greta Thunberg addressed the United Nations at the behest of climate activists. Here's part of what she said: Thunberg, climate change activist: This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school, on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams, my childhood with your empty words. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is the money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you? If you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil, and that I refuse to believe. You stole my childhood? Do what I want you to do, or else you're evil? How do you respond to statements like that? The truth is you can't respond. And of course, that's the point. When you use children to demand power, they become a kind of human shield. You can hide safely behind them, no one can criticize you. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But who would do something that unscrupulous? Anyone who would do that is someone who would literally do anything to seize control. And that's exactly what they're doing.

"""Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a US election, it couldn't be clearer,"" Weld said in an interview on  MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""  ""And that's not just undermining democratic institutions, that is treason. It's treason pure and simple.""  ""The penalty for treason under the US code is death. That's the only penalty,"" Weld added. ""The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the President if he could work out a plea deal."" Weld's comments come amid mounting scrutiny of Trump after he  acknowledged  discussing Biden and his son, Hunter, in a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The call was part of a  whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. White House officials are  now considering  releasing a transcript of the call, multiple sources have told CNN. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Article Three of the Constitution defines treason as ""levying War against [the US] or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort."" The president, the Constitution says, ""shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" US code states individuals found guilty of treason ""shall suffer death"" or face imprisonment, a fine, and ""shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States."" Weld made the comments in a joint interview alongside two other Republicans challenging Trump for the GOP nomination, former congressmen Joe Walsh and Mark Sanford. ""Donald Trump needs to be impeached. Period,"" Walsh said. ""As Bill Weld just said, he told a foreign leader two months ago to interfere in our 2020 election. He needs to be impeached."" Sanford, who also served as governor of South Carolina, echoed Weld and Walsh's strong rhetoric. ""I think you know where the three of us are on this larger debate,"" he said. Earlier this month, all three GOP challengers penned an  op-ed in The Washington Post  lambasting state Republican leaders and Trump for opting to cancel their 2020 presidential primary elections in a show of support for the President. ""The primary nomination process is the only opportunity for Republicans to have a voice in deciding who will represent our party,"" they said. ""Let those voices be heard."" The canceled primaries underscore the difficulty the long-shot candidates will have in challenging Trump, who, according to a CNN/SSRS Poll this month, has an  88% approval rating among Republicans."

"The genius of Barack Obama lay in the fact that Americans looked at him and could believe in almost anything. The left of the Democratic Party saw the revolutionary incarnation of hope, the promise of sweeping social change, and, in a black president, the overturning of America’s original sin. The center saw a measured  product of Harvard Law School,  a prudent reformer, a man of mixed identity and the middle ground.  Moderates were closer to the mark. Obama, a cool man, proved cautious to a fault. Still, the way he  cloaked  his coolness and masked his aloofness in the language of the heart was brilliant. This time around, there is no such political genius out there among the Democratic contenders.  The field appears to have narrowed to the occasionally befuddled and befuddling Joe Biden as the standard-bearer of moderation, and the nimble, plan-a-minute star of the campaign to date, Elizabeth Warren, with her progressive program of social and fiscal reform. Snapping at their heels, from a growing distance, is Bernie Sanders, with voice raised. His habitual dyspepsia has been sharpened by the way Warren steals his revolutionary thunder. No socialist, she; on the contrary,  Warren calls herself a “capitalist to my bones,”  but ready, unlike Biden, to tax the superrich who have skewed America’s promise. That’s her economic patriotism — a smart way to fight Donald Trump’s economic nationalism.  Some game-changer may yet come along. Biden could blow himself up with a shocking moment of incoherence or insult that goes beyond his known liabilities. He has already come close to that. He will be  more  exposed in the months ahead than he was as vice president at the no-drama White House. If the moderate Democratic ground opens up, the temptation for Michael Bloomberg to fill it may prove overwhelming, or, just possibly, another candidate — Kamala Harris, Cory Booker — will gain that elusive traction.  If Warren widens her lead over Sanders, will he withdraw in a way that might wrap it up for her? Railroaded out in 2016, when the Bernie-buzz was fresh, he will not, I suspect, be inclined to favors. Mr. Magnanimous he is not. Warren will have to fight it out. On the evidence, that will galvanize her. Biden is trying to bridge reassurance to the wealthy with outreach to energized progressives. That balancing act has maintained his lead in polls. If two Obama terms were not enough for you, he’s offering something resembling a third — Obamacare Plus;   a possible increase in capital-gains tax to address inequality.  Will this fine-tuning be enough in an agitated America, whiplashed by President Trump? I doubt it.  The under-30s, maybe under-40s, are underwhelmed by Biden , even angry that this honorable man has not chosen dignified retirement. He’s the emblem of the permanent political class, the one that  created  the conditions for Trump, in an era that Trump’s wild policy lurches and heresies and, yes, lies have now transformed. America’s restoration, after this trauma, will not be achieved by going back. What created Trump cannot oust Trump.   It will demand a new politics, and a new integrity, such as the one Warren has set out and embodied with greater vigor, persuasiveness and coherence than anyone else. Biden, on whom  Trump may have been seeking dirt in a July phone call  with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, can put an end to the president’s sullying of the Oval Office. He can’t, however, embody renewal. Is Warren too far left to win?   Maybe. Does she worry some purple-district Democrats who did well in 2018? Yes. But she can adjust. As for “electability,” an overused word, well, Trump won, and may again, so all bets are off. I said Biden has come close to a blowup moment. The campaign is grueling. You don’t have to be almost 77 to slip up. But he has demonstrated tone-deafness on race in a way that is disturbing. His reference to a  “record player” in the last Democratic debate  in the context of a question about reparations for slavery tied Biden to a bygone era, but that was far from the worst of it. Talking about black families — that is what the question was about — he actually said: “We bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It’s not that they don’t want to help. They don’t, they don’t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television — excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the, the — — make sure the kids hear words.” They don’t know what to do! Make sure the kids hear words ! This is insulting toward African-Americans. It’s of a piece with Biden’s comment (quickly adjusted) in August that “we have this notion that somehow if you’re poor, you cannot do it. Poor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids.” There’s a way, and a need, to talk about fundamental systemic racial injustice, but this is emphatically not it. Black does not equal poor and inept. The genius has left a void. Right now it’s not his vice president who may just fill it enough, but Warren.

"Pelosi,  who sharpened her rhetoric over the weekend , is still not committing to moving forward with impeachment proceedings -- but she is feeling the tide turn. In a brief interview with CNN as she flew from New York to Washington Monday, Pelosi again declined to say whether she would fully endorse initiating an impeachment inquiry when she meets with committee chairmen and members of the Democratic caucus on Tuesday. But she left little doubt the developments around the whistleblower's complaint had dramatically escalated the standoff with President Donald Trump and a move toward impeachment proceedings was all but certain.  ""We will have no choice,"" Pelosi said of ultimately initiating an impeachment inquiry. She did not say whether the move toward impeachment could be slowed if the White House provided the whistleblower's report. During the flight, Pelosi read a  Washington Post op-ed  from seven freshman Democrats who made the case for impeachment.  She said she had advance notice the lawmakers were planning to join forces to collectively argue the president's actions ""represent an impeachable offense.""  ""It will be a big week,"" Pelosi said. The reason: The substance of the complaint is not yet clear. And it's still unclear how the Trump administration will respond.  Multiple Democratic sources told CNN that if the White House completely stonewalls Democrats for the information, it will make the calculus easier for moving forward with impeachment proceedings. But if the White House provides a  transcript, or seeks to muddy the waters in its response, that could make it more challenging for Democrats to unify behind impeachment, even  after President Donald Trump's admission  of discussing Vice President Joe Biden and his son in his phone call with the Ukrainian leader. That's why this week is critical for House Democrats to decide which course to take. They are awaiting to see how the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, responds during Thursday's high-stakes hearing before the House Intelligence Committee -- and whether the administration provides any more details about Trump's conversations with Ukrainian leaders or the substance of the whistleblower complaint. Plus, Pelosi and House Democratic leaders are waiting to see how members respond --  particularly ones in difficult races who represent GOP-leaning districts  -- to see if it's time to move ahead. Pelosi, a savvy vote counter, has no desire to move forward with impeachment if it lacks 218 votes in the House, Democratic sources say, and before the Ukraine controversy, it is almost certain that the House Democrats would have fallen well short of that majority threshold. That could change depending on how the latest controversy shakes out.  The House Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon, according to three Democratic sources. A leadership aide told CNN that the topic is likely to be about the next steps on investigations.   ""The dominant focus of the caucus on Wednesday is trade, a second caucus has been added to ensure adequate time for member discussion on the whistleblower matter and a number of other pressing matters on Tuesday afternoon,"" a Democratic leadership aide said in a statement Monday evening. 'When are Democrats going to get tough?' The impeachment fight remains a divisive issue in the party as Democratic leaders continue their investigations into the Trump administration -- including a new subpoena threat from a trio of House chairmen -- following a steady stream of developments on the issue over the past couple days.  Democrats, including freshmen from Trump districts and moderates who have resisted calls for impeachment, are telling their colleagues privately they are prepared to announce their support for impeachment proceedings if the controversy continues to grow -- namely if there's evidence that Trump sought to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigating the Bidens, according to Democratic sources involved in the conversations.  That could change the calculus for Pelosi, who has in part resisted moving forward on impeachment because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash over impeachment. But if those members come out in support of impeachment proceedings, Pelosi is bound to shift her positioning as well, according to Democrats close to the speaker. ""I think we're reaching a tipping point both within our base and within our caucus,"" Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat on the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, told CNN on Monday. ""This weekend, all I hear at home is when are Democrats going to get tough?"" Connolly said. ""We are looking weak."" So far,  as many as 137 House Democrats have publicly stated  their support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, according a CNN count -- more than half the caucus and with dozens having joined in the past two months. But that number is still far below a majority of House members and Pelosi has long warned of the political consequences of taking such a step against the Presidents.  Speaking to CNN's Poppy Harlow on ""Newsroom"" Monday, Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas said if Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in exchange for a reopening of an investigation into Biden's son, he would support an impeachment inquiry. ""I don't think we have a choice under the Constitution. We must move forward with impeachment proceedings. I don't think we'll have much of a choice,"" Gonzalez said.  New subpoena threat The new comments from Democratic lawmakers Monday comes as three House committees threatened to subpoena the State Department over ""documents the State Department has been withholding in response to a letter the Chairmen sent two weeks ago relating to efforts by the President and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to solicit the help of a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 Presidential Election."" Three chairmen -- House intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel and Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings -- authored a letter Monday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. ""Seeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution, which the President is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend,"" the three chairmen wrote jointly. ""Yet the President and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election."" Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he discussed the former vice president in a July call with Ukraine's president. CNN has previously reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was also part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, which hasn't been shared with lawmakers despite calls from Democrats. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  This story has been updated with additional developments Monday."

"Presidents these days always seem to get worse, don’t they?  To many on the left, Donald Trump is an order of magnitude more disastrous a commander in chief than was George W. Bush, whose reputation now stands thoroughly  rehabilitated  in the popular culture. Bush is no longer the incurious man who launched an unnecessary  war  that killed  hundreds of thousands  in Iraq; today, he’s the goofy old fella who  paints portraits of the troops ,  pals around with Michelle Obama  and seems to be in on the joke of our times.  “Sorta makes me look pretty good, doesn’t it?” Bush  has been reported  to smirk about the Trump era.  For the record, I think the jury is still out on whether Trump is worse than Bush. But for most of 2019, I’ve been trying to picture a future that elevates Trump in the same way it did Bush: How much worse could all t his  get? And worse in what direction — what politics, policies, rhetoric and media mastery will the next extremely terrible president marshal to ruin America anew?  In short: What sort of character do we have to imagine occupying the White House in 2029 to make lefties like myself feel even a slight pang of nostalgia for the good old days of Donald J. Trump?  The thought experiment is instructive because it compels us to ponder some of the fundamental forces shaping American culture and politics at the moment. It is also horrifying, because what quickly becomes evident is that we  might  now be only in the middle of everything spinning out of control.  Come, take a stroll with me through my recurrent nightmare: It’s the sweltering summer of 2029, and the man in charge is Tucker Carlson — that is, President Tucker Carlson, the one-time Fox News talker turned righteous, white nationalist economic populist, now in his triumphant second term, after having defeated the incumbent Joseph “Recession Joe” Biden back in 2024. Like Trump, President Carlson  spends  his first term refashioning America along racial lines. But unlike Trump, whose one term is now regarded by much of the right as a best-forgotten political disaster,  Carlson  advances an ethnonationalist populism that succeeds in  a  wild, frightening fashion. His secret: competence, a commitment to true political realignment, and a brutal online political machine that represents the full flowering of the tactics and ideology first displayed during  2014’s Gamergate  movement. Where Trump was a chaotic, undisciplined narcissist, the Carlson who wins in 2024 is a canny political strategist who makes good on Trump’s forgotten promise to embrace anti-corporate economic policies. On paper, parts of Carlson’s agenda seem ripped from the former liberal firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren (now in exile in Toronto): His  chief enemies  are Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, the megacorporations owned and staffed by wealthy liberals.  It’s a winning electoral formula: A large minority of Americans are willing to forgive Carlson’s authoritarian, nativist impulses if they see it as part of a war against the out-of-touch, culture-destroying corporations that are automating our jobs; killing every other industry; and exercising complete control over what we watch, read, listen to, buy and believe. And in America, thanks to the Electoral College, winning over a large minority is good enough to  regularly win the presidency .  Obviously I am making all of this up. But my premonition is based on months of research — this is what you might call an  educated  nightmare. My education: Carlson’s own nightly Fox News show, which I’ve been watching obsessively since January. I began tuning in because Carlson — who,  with nearly three million viewers a night , is the second most popular host on cable, after Sean Hannity — has become one of the most fascinatingly terrifying men in conservative media.  There are  two  things that terrify and fascinate me about Carlson. First,  unlike  most  Republican  lawmakers today, Carlson is sketching an economic vision of a post-Trump America that departs in key ways from Trumpism, especially in its muscular anti-corporate, populist zeal.  In January,  in a commentary that went viral on the right , Carlson excoriated American political leaders for their commitment to empty capitalism: “For our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer,”  he said . “They teach us it’s more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids.”  He regularly criticizes the tech giants , whom he argues are censoring his and his followers’ views. But he also hates corporations more generally for what he calls their attempts to influence culture and politics (including  by boycotting his show ): His critics,  he said in May , “believe democracy is when a tiny group of rich people imposes its values on everyone else by force.""  In June,  Carlson praised Elizabeth Warren’s plan for “economic patriotism” : “Many of Warren’s policy prescriptions make obvious sense,” he said, wondering why Republicans, including Trump, didn’t join her vision. “What if the Republican leadership here in Washington had bothered to learn the lessons of the 2016 election?” The second thing that scares me about Carlson is his racism, which is both more extreme and more cannily packaged for a digital audience than is Trump’s.  While Trump is a creature of cable television, Carlson’s segments look like extended YouTube clips, and they’re designed to play to an audience that is  extremely online.  His critics and  white supremacists themselves  point out that, more than anyone else on television, Carlson functions as a kind of  laundromat for white identity movements : Several times a week, he’ll lift ideas, story lines and troll-based narratives directly from the fetid swamp of online hatred. Then he’ll clean these theories up and wrap them in a bow for his mainstream audience, usually to advance an overarching idea that he mentions constantly: that, thanks to  an “invasion” of immigrants , white people in America and Europe face economic and cultural calamity, and that the political, corporate and media establishments are abetting their destruction.  “No one covers white identity more consistently than Tucker,” said Madeline Peltz, who  watches Carlson’s show every night  as a researcher for Media Matters for America, a liberal advocacy group that tracks conservative outlets. “I cannot remember a single episode in the last two years that didn’t include these  ideas. ” I’d known all this before I started watching, but actually watching blew my mind: Carlson’s propaganda was so constant, and the sleight of hand with which he inserted barely sanitized racist theories into his broadcast so swift, that I began to see the outlines of my nightmare — that Trump was only a prelude, and that even if he loses next year, someone far more sophisticated than our current president could come along to push digitally mediated politics in an even darker direction.  Carlson — who talks often with Trump, and was reportedly instrumental in advising Trump against  attacking Iran in June  —  recently disclaimed any interest in running for president . He has been a nimble shape-shifter over the course of his career (a decade ago,  he was a libertarian ), so it’s possible that his latest critiques of capitalism are  just an act .  But he may also have noticed that  there are lots of conservative voters in America who don’t care for the Republican Party’s giveaways to corporations . Hence the outlines of a political vision: Carlson is aiming to mix a lefty-sounding economic agenda with a white nationalist-inspired cultural agenda — and to muddy the marriage by arguing that his and his followers’ ideas are being  stifled by the tech giants that he’s fighting .  This is Carlson’s entire schtick. He uses the cover of capitalist hardship to advance theories of white oppression, often  while summoning further harassment of his critics . He’s taking it to television, five nights a week. And where it ends up could be hellish. Office Hours With Farhad Manjoo Farhad wants to  chat with readers on the phone .

"Pelosi announces plans to go forward; Mike Emanuel has the details. We've grown used to radical Leftists, in Congress and the media, having their  soup de jour , the accusation of the day. But this latest one has actually prompted  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  to announce a formal impeachment inquiry. What is the accusation? President  Donald Trump  called the Ukrainian president to congratulate him on his election and discussed several things, including the investigation of alleged illegal conduct on the part of the son of a prominent American politician. This is just another fail. Within the past few weeks, the Left has floated impeaching Supreme Court Justice  Brett Kavanaugh , criticized Vice President Mike Pence for an extended stay during a visit to his foreign, historical family home, melted down over the President’s invitation of national leaders of the G7 to one of his properties, and most ludicrously, blasted him for allegedly stealing pancakes. HANS VON SPAKOVSKY: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT EFFORT WILL BE HISTORIC POLITICAL BATTLE – HERE'S HOW THE PROCESS WORKS The media wonders why its credibility is in the dumpster. The Left wonders why the President has the approval of most Americans, higher than former President Barack Obama at the same juncture of his term. The standard bearer of the latest effort to impeach President Trump is Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of the House intelligence Committee. You will remember him for his zealous advocacy for reliance on the Mueller Report. Schiff promised that evidence of Russian collusion was real, present, and would be confirmed in the Mueller Report. Oops. The Mueller investigation did not support Schiff’s promised conclusion. In fact, it found that there was no collusion, cooperation or coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. So here we are again. The Democrats desire to get the transcript of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This seems wholly unwarranted based on the allegations of an unknown person, who probably did not even hear the conversation. This individual apparently heard about the conversation from someone else. Such testimony would never be allowed in court because it is inherently unreliable. Ukraine's foreign minister says there were no threats on the call. There was nothing untoward or out of the ordinary in the conversation. And, it reveals something about the way things work in the White House. It seems that the President has no private conversations with leaders of foreign countries. I suspect that the leaders of other nations understand that those conversations are scrutinized by the U.S. intelligence apparatus. But I also believe that foreign leaders do not anticipate that Americans are so cavalier as to transcribe these conversations and then pass them on to Congress, which seems to have the loosest of lips. In fact, foreign leaders probably do not realize there is a threat that their conversations could be leaked, if given to Schiff, a person that former Congressman Trey Gowdy has described as leakier than a screen-door on a submarine. What do the Ukrainian leaders have to say about the content of the conversation? Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko says there were no threats. There was nothing untoward or out of the ordinary in the conversation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER But, in a bid for moral equivalence, let’s consider the Bidens, who were the purported object of at least part of the phone conversation. Joe Biden once bragged that he had been in Ukraine and demanded that its leaders fire a prosecutor who was investigating allegations of wrongdoing of an international energy company, or else. Oh, by the way, Biden’s son, Hunter, sat on the board of directors of that company. Was it out of line to inquire of an American who was under investigation by the Ukrainians? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP How about the projection of the Left? They projected a false narrative for years, creating a division in our nation that may not heal for a generation, that the Trump administration is illegitimate because of Russian “collusion” in the 2016 election. But, it turns out, that Ukrainians donated tens of millions of dollars to the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee. In fact, the Ukraine government voted to investigate that. Prediction: the Left will persist in its quixotic quest to remove President Donald Trump. And, when the Ukraine telephone gambit fades, look for the next stolen pancake allegation to consume our misguided friends. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP. ANDY BIGGS"
"Trump addresses reporters as he arrives at the United Nations, says 'what Biden did was wrong.' The Trump administration pushed back Tuesday in the wake of multiple reports that the White House froze millions in aid to Ukraine shortly before President Trump pressured the country's leader to  investigate  Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The reports coincided with a renewed round of calls,  including from more centrist Democrats, for a formal impeachment inquiry. Those calls came a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she is opening the door to that route if the administration continues to withhold a whistleblower complaint apparently related to  Trump's Ukraine  discussions. FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AMID BOMBSHELL REPORTS TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE AID Multiple administration sources confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that the Office of Management and Budget indeed told the State Department and Department of Defense in July that it was putting a hold on nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. But administration sources told Fox News that the reason for the freeze on Ukrainian aid was tied to concerns about corruption. Sources said that Trump wanted to be confident that the incoming administration of Volodymyr Zelensky was going to take steps to end corruption before releasing the funding. The aid to Ukraine also, according to sources, came up in the context of other countries and questions about whether they were paying their share. Trump, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly later Tuesday, insisted he only sought to hold up the Ukraine aid because he “wanted other countries to pay.” “There was no quid pro quo,” he said. “There was no pressure applied, nothing.” The White House’s decision to release the funding ultimately was made in mid-August, after Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, called the president and said that Ukraine desperately needed the aid, according to administration sources. The White House, at the time, was also up against an appropriation “impoundment” deadline, which meant the money would either have to be spent, or impounded. The White House would have been forced to go to court to justify the impoundment, which sources said it did not want to do. The White House, though, has denied the allegations that the freezing of the Ukrainian aid was tied to allegations that the president asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. “The media pushed the Russia lie for almost three years with no evidence, and now they are doing it all over again,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News. “These allegations are completely false, but because the media wants this story to be true so badly, they’ll once again manufacture a frenzy and drive ignorant, fake stories to attack this President.” In remarks to reporters at the United Nations Monday, Trump also denied linking the aid money to Ukraine’s investigative actions. “No, I didn’t—I didn’t do it,” Trump said, also calling the Biden’s actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” and adding: “It’s very important to talk about corruption…Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?” But Democrats are concerned the president may have essentially withheld money to Ukraine as leverage to seek an investigation concerning the Bidens -- which is now prompting renewed impeachment calls. The furor began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week that involved allegations that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Zelensky. A person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have “firsthand knowledge” of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, but Democrats want to see the complaint. SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL Joe Biden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump and his allies have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate's role. Nevertheless, Democrats have used the reports and new allegations against the president to press forward—even as it risks backfiring by exposing potential wrongdoing by Biden. Late Monday night, a slew of key swing-district Democrats publicly offered their support for opening a formal impeachment inquiry. Seven centrist Democratic freshmen lawmakers who served in the military and national security announced in an op-ed in The Washington Post that if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens for political benefit, it’s impeachable. The lawmakers included Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. The Democrats wrote in The Washington Post they ""do not arrive at this conclusion lightly."" “These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent,"" the lawmakers said. “These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do.” Also, later Monday night, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz and Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell endorsed an impeachment inquiry. Such an inquiry would not be an impeachment vote, but rather an investigative process that could lead to actual impeachment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There are now 154 House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with  one independent  -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach the president. An unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove the president.) Fox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report. "
"Good morning and welcome to  Fox News First .  Here's what you need to know as you start your day ... Flurry of House Dems back Trump impeachment inquiry as reports say Trump froze Ukraine aid 
Just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching President Trump,  a slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry . The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came as the New York Times, the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine ""in the days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate the Democrats’ leading presidential candidate,"" Joe Biden. Fox News has not confirmed that report, which was attributed to two senior administration officials. An official told the Wall Street Journal that the Trump administration internally maintained at the time that Ukraine's corruption problems were a consideration in the aid decision. Trump's decision to freeze Ukraine funding reportedly came more than a week before his call with Zelensky. Leaders of the House Democrats, meanwhile, scheduled a meeting for Tuesday afternoon on how to handle the explosive whistleblower complaint concerning the president's phone call with the Ukrainian president this past July.

The escalating controversy over President Trump’s phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  has ignited a battle on Capitol Hill  over Democrats’ demands for a copy of the whistleblower complaint against Trump, as some liberal lawmakers threatened subpoenas while Republicans called for restraint while they gather facts. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, but Democrats have been moving full steam ahead, calling for the whistleblower complaint to be released to lawmakers. Republicans say Democrats are playing politics, seizing on allegations that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate dealings involving Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, to revive the push for impeachment. Meanwhile, a source told Fox News that the  whistleblower who sparked a mounting controversy did not have “firsthand knowledge”  of the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president.  In an exclusive interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity , Vice President Mike Pence blasted the media over its coverage of the Ukrainian controversy. The media, Pence said, have been relentless in their condemnation Trump while ignoring the allegations of ""quid-pro-quo"" against Joe Biden.

As the Ukrainian whistleblower controversy brews, President Trump is preparing to call for a multi-national response to Iran's escalating aggression when he goes before the U.N. General Assembly in New York City on Tuesday. While Trump wants allies to join the U.S. in further isolating Iran, he also seems to be holding to his go-it-alone strategy of using economic sanctions to pressure Tehran to give up its nuclear program and stop attacks that are rattling the Middle East. On Monday, the president praised British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's call for a new deal to replace the 2015 Iran nuclear pact from which Trump walked away. Trump was expected to use his speech to blame Iran for recent strikes against oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. Iran has denied orchestrating the attack, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has deemed ""an act of war."" Britain, France and Germany joined the United States on Monday in blaming Iran for the attacks. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, for his part, pointed to claims of responsibility by Yemeni rebels.  - Reported by the Associated Press

       DNC raises qualifying thresholds for November debate The Democratic National Committee is raising the bar for presidential candidates  to qualify for November’s fifth-round primary debate. The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates. But, the upping of polling and donor thresholds – more modest than the doubling of the criteria from July’s second round to this month’s third round – may not significantly winnow the field of White House contenders still standing after October’s debate.

"Chris Stirewalt on Cory Booker's campaign memo Democratic presidential candidate  Sen. Cory Booker's, D-N.J. , recent campaign memo may foreshadow some drastic change in the  2020 field , according to Chris Stirewalt. The missive,  from Booker campaign manager Addisu Demissie , may signal the potential withdrawal of a handful of lower-tier candidates in the coming months -- therefore shaking up the support structure of the front-runners, Stirewalt claimed Monday on "" Special Report ."" ""It's reflective of what's about to happen -- what's going on in the field and what's going to continue to happen,"" he said. ""We're finally reaching a period where there's the possibility for some real substantive change in the composition, as the two-percenters and three-percenters drop out... As those candidates wash out, their vote share gets reapportioned."" CORY BOOKER MEMO WARNS CANDIDATE MAY NOT BE IN RACE 'MUCH LONGER' WITHOUT FUNDRAISING BOOST The Fox News digital politics editor added that although the lower-tier candidates do not command the same voter support as people like  former Vice President Joe Biden  or  Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , those voters will still have to shift their support somewhere. ""That's where Biden's opportunity to hold the line is -- to hold on to that share as it comes to him,"" Stirewalt added. In an MSNBC interview, Booker said he doesn't want to ""stick around"" if he's not ""in this to win it"" -- however adding the last couple days have drawn a windfall in fundraising numbers. In Demissie's memo, the campaign warned Booker must raise $1.7 million by the end of the third fundraising quarter in order to have a likely path to the nomination. The existence of the memo was first reported Saturday morning by NBC News, with Fox News confirming the news with multiple sources. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Two sources, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said it was no accident that the memo was leaked, and described it as an effort to spark a surge in fundraising over the next 10 days. On "" Special Report ,"" Stirewalt added the former Newark mayor's apparent plea for financial support is an ultimatum to supporters. ""It's like the old 'National Lampoon' cover -- buy this magazine or we'll shoot this dog. Give me the money or I will have to quit. It's a desperation play,"" he said."
"This article is part of Paul Krugman’s newsletter. You can  sign up here  to receive it each weekday. Only 11 days have passed since Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee,  revealed  that the Trump administration was illegally withholding a whistle-blower complaint from Congress. When the news came out, I — probably like most observers — expected it to be another fizzle, yet another clear example of Trump malfeasance that would just fail to catch fire with Congress or the public. And that may yet happen. I presume and hope that pollsters are at work as we speak, trying to gauge public opinion on the scandal. But this time feels different, maybe because it’s so simple and clear cut. The president of the United States and his personal lawyer both admit that they called on a foreign regime to produce dirt on one of his political rivals. It now looks as if he tried to pressure said foreign regime by  withholding crucial military aid , which makes it worse. The result is that this scandal is blowing up in a way previous Trump scandals, no matter how serious, haven’t. A House vote to impeach has quickly gone from “unlikely” to “more likely than not” now that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to announce a formal impeachment inquiry. Why does this matter? In general, I dislike the common journalistic trope of “winners and losers” from political developments. In this case, however, it seems to me like a good way to sum up the fallout so far. So here are three winners and two losers from the developments so far. Winners 1. Adam Schiff: After years when it seemed as if nothing could shake Trump’s ability to stonewall, Schiff started an avalanche that has a good chance of bringing the wall tumbling down. 2. The narrative of Trump as betrayer of America: There has been abundant evidence all along that Trump’s team colluded with Russia in 2016, and that Trump in office has been all too happy to carry water for brutal foreign autocrats. But it was all complicated and obscure enough to confuse many people. Pressuring Ukraine to smear Joe Biden’s son is something everyone can understand, and it retroactively makes all the other accusations credible. 3. Hard-working reporters: We don’t have all the facts about what exactly Trump and company did to set off the whistle-blower, but the past week and a half have been one devastating revelation after another, all thanks to reporters at major news outlets, including The Times. Losers 1. “Savvy” journalistic analysis: The two great media sins of 2016 were false equivalence and the substitution of speculation about how things would “play” for description of what was actually going on. Sure enough, the first reaction of some in the media was to present Trump’s verified abuse of power and completely unsupported claims of corruption by Joe Biden as comparably grave, and to suggest that the episode somehow “raises questions” about Biden — a cowardly dodge of the media’s obligation to get at the truth. But articles along these lines generated huge criticism, and I’m seeing a lot less of that sort of thing in the past couple of days. 2. Senate Republicans: It’s looking quite likely now that G.O.P. senators will have to vote on charges of impeachment — charges that will be based on documented abuses, not disputable interpretations. Most if not all of them will, of course, vote to acquit. But in so doing they’ll expose their corruption and disloyalty to American principles for all to see. So it’s been quite a couple of weeks. And while it won’t be over until November of next year, and probably not even then, it looks as if Trump and his party are finally in the kind of trouble they deserve. Quick Hits The Founding Fathers worried a lot about foreign influence on U.S. politics; sometimes it seems as if Trump took their concerns as an  operating manual . It’s important to realize that Ukraine is engaged in a slow-motion war with Trump’s  favorite dictator . Diplomacy depends on the use of both sticks and carrots. Trump gets the sticks part, but the carrots part doesn’t work because nobody trusts him to  honor his promises . You can almost feel sorry for Republicans, who know that any criticism of Trump will  tank them with the base . On the other hand, never mind; they chose to put themselves in that position.

"The age of transparency must be balanced against an enduring presidential interest, says Fox News contributor Ken Starr, former independent counsel. Fox News contributor Ken Starr said Tuesday that the White House should not ""rush"" to release a transcript of President Trump's phone call with the president of  Ukraine  that triggered a whistleblower complaint and calls for impeachment from some  House Democrats . Trump was accused of pressuring President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate  Joe Biden  in connection with his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine. The furor began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week that involved allegations that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Zelensky. The Trump administration  pushed back Tuesday  against accusations that Trump pressured Zelensky over Hunter Biden while also holding back nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. Starr, a former independent counsel and U.S. solicitor general, responded on  ""America's Newsroom""  to Democrats who are demanding that the White House release the transcript of the call. SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL ""Not at this time. I don't think there should be a rush. There are dangers, the precedent of any president making public transcripts of confidential conversations,"" he said. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE' Starr said all calls between a U.S. president and a foreign leader are ""sensitive,"" suggesting a negotiated solution between the White House and the Senate Intelligence Committee in the interest of ""accountability and checks and balances."" ""There are different ways of calibrating and negotiating this, but don't rush to publish,"" Starr cautioned the White House. GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""We live, I know, in the age of transparency. But that has to be balanced against an enduring presidential interest in carrying on the foreign policy of the United States in a responsible way."" Biden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump and  his allies  have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate's role."
"South Bend mayor says the amateur model is 'not fair' to college athletes; Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren weighs in. Democratic presidential hopeful  Pete Buttigieg  said on Monday that the model for  college football  has become ""problematic,” explaining that the system has become unfair to college  athletes . ""First, you need to look at what we owe students. Obviously the model says you get an education in exchange for contributing this way, plus the sport is supposed to be its own reward, but I don’t think that that’s really fair anymore. ... It's problematic and I don't have a solution,"" the South Bend, Indiana mayor said, according to  Jewish Insider . NCAA TELLS CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR COLLEGE ATHLETE 'FAIR PAY' BILL IS 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL' Buttigieg went on to note the massive popularity of the sport in his hometown, which is home to the campus of Notre Dame. “I think about it from a perspective of a city that relies on college football in the same way that Bahrain relies on fossil fuel.” Buttigieg also  said  that he has “qualms” about letting a child play football and favors soccer. NCAA TO CONSIDER ALLOWING ATHLETES TO CASH IN ON THEIR NAMES His comments came after the California State Assembly voted 72-0 to pass a bill  allowing college athletes to profit from their name, image and likeness . The bill is championed by many athletes in the collegiate and professional ranks, such as Lebron James. The state Senate passed the measure 39-0. Following Buttigieg's comments, Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren said the debate about paying college athletes is a valid topic, but it seems like Democrats have an ever-growing list of things that are ""problematic"" in American society. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Is it just me or do liberals just want to take the fun out of everything? They want to take away your straws, your cheeseburgers and now your college football because now that's morally problematic as well. It seems like everything and every American tradition, for the Democrats, is problematic in some way,” Lahren said on ""Fox & Friends First."" Lahren also said that Buttigieg's lack of solution on the matter is typical of Democrats and his message does not resonate with average Americans, especially those in Iowa. Fox News’ Louis Casiano and Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report."
"Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard joins Brian Kilmeade on 'Fox &amp; Friends.' Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , D-Hawaii, said Tuesday she will not join with other  House Democrats  in supporting the impeachment of  President Trump . The push for  impeachment  has picked up steam in recent days, including from  Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., in response to a whistleblower complaint that reportedly alleged Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate  Joe Biden  and his son, Hunter Biden. Gabbard, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in a crowded field, said on  ""Fox & Friends""  that she has been consistent in saying that victory in the 2020 election, not impeachment, is the way for Democrats to make sure Trump leaves office. SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL ""I believe that impeachment at this juncture would be terribly divisive for the country at a time when we are already extremely divided. The hyperpartisanship is one of the main things driving our country apart,"" she told host Brian Kilmeade. Gabbard's comments are in contrast to many of her Democratic colleagues, including Warren, one of the top contenders in the presidential race. ""The House must impeach. It must start today,"" Warren tweeted Tuesday morning. In addition, a slew of key swing-district Democrats  threw their support  en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as  The New York Times ,  The Washington Post  and  The Wall Street Journal  reported Monday that Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens. GET THE FOX NEWS APP The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  strongly suggested  she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus would meet on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed. Fox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report."

Biden Jr.’s son Hunter  in a July phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine . News outlets have reported that this call was part of a whistle-blower’s complaint against Trump and that the president asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son before the 2020 election. Credit Credit Video by Late Night With Seth Meyers “He brought it up eight times on one phone call. Eight times makes it seem like a pretty obvious crime. It’s like if you went on trial for stabbing a guy and said, ‘It was an accident. He fell on the knife,’ and they said, ‘Eight times?’” —  SETH MEYERS “Yeah, Trump asked Ukraine for election help, or as he put it, ‘I was just trying to make Putin jealous.’” —  JIMMY FALLON “Right now Eric and Don Jr. are thinking, ‘Damn, he pays more attention to Biden’s kid.’” —  JIMMY FALLON “Today reporters asked Trump if he did anything wrong. He was like, ‘Yeah, I probably should have asked for dirt on Elizabeth Warren.’” —  JIMMY FALLON “We spent years talking about Russia; it might be Ukraine that takes down Trump. Who saw that coming? That’s like looking both ways before you cross the street then getting hit by a drone.”  — JIMMY FALLON “Maybe even crazier is the fact that Trump did this on July 25th, the day after the Mueller testimony. So a day after the conclusion of a major investigation into whether he got help in an election from a foreign leader, he gets on the phone and asks for help from another foreign leader. It’s like the only thing I can compare it to is when Mike Tyson bit Evander Holyfield’s ear and then bit Evander Holyfield’s other ear.” —  JIMMY KIMMEL “The bottom line is it would appear the president used his office to ask a foreign country to dig up dirt on his opponent, and Democrats in Congress are thinking very seriously about threatening to maybe consider almost doing something about it.” —  JIMMY KIMMEL “Today Nancy Pelosi said, ‘Another five or 600 violations and we might think about impeachment.’”  — JIMMY FALLON “While addressing the whistle-blower complaint about Ukraine, Nancy Pelosi accused President Trump of endangering national security. Yeah, Nancy, where you been? You’re like, my mom’s friend who is watching Season 4 of ‘Breaking Bad’ and says, ‘I think this guy might be dealing meth.’” —  SETH MEYERS “I know they say that history repeats itself, but usually it’s after a few generations, not, like, two years later with the exact same person.”  — JAMES CORDEN The Punchiest Punchlines (Emmys Edition) “Only seven million people watched the Emmys, and one million of those were ‘Game of Thrones’ cast members.” —  CONAN O’BRIEN “This was the lowest-rated Emmys ever by a lot. They’re saying if things get any worse they may have to add themselves to the in memoriam reel.” —  JIMMY KIMMEL “The Emmys in memoriam section — you know, where we say goodbye to people — accidentally broadcast a photo of a person who’s not dead yet. Yes. Yeah. Today, the producers apologized profusely to Bernie Sanders.” —  CONAN O’BRIEN “The streaming platforms did very well last night. Twenty-seven Emmys for Netflix, seven Emmys for Amazon and three Emmys for Zappos.”  — CONAN O’BRIEN “So many of the awards last night went to foreigners. There were so many British people onstage, I didn’t know if I was watching the Emmys or the ‘Downton Abbey’ movie.” —  JIMMY KIMMEL The Bits Worth Watching Kimmel sidekick Guillermo caught Sunday night’s Emmy winners as they came off the stage for another series of his Back to Back interviews. What We’re Excited About on Tuesday Night Ta-Nehisi Coates will talk with Stephen Colbert about his new novel, “The Water Dancer.” Also, Check This Out HBO may have won big at this year’s Emmys, but with companies like Apple and Disney getting into content streaming,  the premium cable network is facing fiercer competition than ever before ."
