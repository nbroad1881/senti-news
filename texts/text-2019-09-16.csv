"Instead, the Massachusetts Democrat is running on a bill that she first signed on to in 2017: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' ""Medicare for All"" single-payer legislation. ""I'm with Bernie,""  Warren has said more than once  in recent months when asked about her vision for the American health care system. Warren's decision to wholly embrace another candidate's idea -- particularly on an issue of such outsized significance in the 2020 election -- has put her in an unfamiliar position of defending and advocating a proposal that is not uniquely hers. And she's made clear that she has no intention of authoring a comprehensive health care plan of her own during the Democratic primary contest. Warren has gone to considerable lengths in recent months to demonstrate unwavering support for Medicare for All, in one of the clearest signs of the political alliance forged between Warren and Sanders, even as they jockey for second place behind former Vice President Joe Biden. But there are early signs of the potential risks involved in Warren's full embrace of Sanders' signature proposal -- she's opened herself up to the familiar criticism that Medicare for All is too expensive, disruptive and unrealistic.  Those dynamics were on full display at Thursday night's presidential debate, when she was asked -- again -- whether Medicare for All would result in tax hikes for the middle class. Not for the first time, Warren pivoted.   ""Look, what families have to deal with is cost, total cost,""  Warren said on the debate stage , without directly answering the question about taxes. ""And the answer is, on Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations. But for hardworking families across this country, costs are going to go down, and that's how it should work under Medicare for All in our health care system."" Her argument is that in the aggregate, Americans will spend less on health care in a single-payer system, which would eliminate premiums paid to health insurance companies, along with deductibles and copayments. But questions about additional taxes for the middle class are not going away anytime soon, and would ramp up in intensity if Warren were to win the Democratic nomination. A Warren aide declined to comment on questions about whether there are plans for Warren to release a health care proposal of her own -- either during the primary or in the general election campaign -- as well as about middle-class tax hikes under Medicare for All, instead referring CNN to  Warren's remarks after Thursday's debate . Reassurance for progressives If Warren is confronting criticism from colleagues to the ideological right of her, the decision to take an unequivocal stance on Medicare for All has also had the effect of reassuring some progressive admirers. In interviews with CNN, activists who vocally back Medicare for All said Warren's recent ""I'm with Bernie"" positioning helped assuage concerns about her earlier, more circumspect, tone on Medicare for All. She has previously mused about ""different pathways"" to Medicare for All and spoken about other, less ambitious bills she had co-sponsored in the Senate. And asked by CNN's Jake Tapper at a town hall in March whether she supported eliminating private health insurance, as Medicare for All would effectively do,  Warren responded  that Sanders has ""got a runway for that."" ""I think we get everybody together. And that's what it is, we'll decide,"" she said. ""I've also co-sponsored other bills, including expanding Medicaid as another approach that we use."" Waleed Shahid, communications director for Justice Democrats, the group best known for helping to launch Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's successful 2018 campaign for a congressional seat from New York, said Warren's ""I'm with Bernie"" comments marked ""an incredibly important moment for her campaign."" ""I think many progressives were kind of confused and getting mixed signals from her on Medicare for All,"" Shahid said. ""That was a big moment for her to come out, pretty full-throated, for what's in the Bernie and (Washington state Rep. Pramila) Jayapal bills, which is a single-payer system."" Asked if Warren should roll out her own version of Medicare for All, Shahid argued that such a move might be counterproductive -- both for Warren and the single-payer movement. ""I don't think she needs to put out her own plan or anything like that,"" he said. ""In fact, putting out her own plan would be seen as competing with the existing bills that people have been rallying around and worked really hard on."" One of Warren's most ardent outside backers,  Adam Green of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, acknowledged  -- on the June night she said it -- that Warren's ""I'm with Bernie"" declaration on the debate stage ""gave anyone who prioritizes that issue a permission structure for clearly voting for her.""  Michael Lighty, a Medicare for All advocate and former director of public policy for National Nurses United, the first major union to endorse Sanders in 2016, was part of the push to build support in the Senate for the 2017 Medicare for All bill.  That included a sales pitch to Warren's office, which he said initially viewed it with some skepticism. ""Her staff gave the same consideration to that policy that she does to everything, which is pretty severe scrutiny, really,"" said Lighty, who is supporting Sanders again in 2020. Ultimately, though, Warren came around to the legislation, and was in the room next to her colleague from Vermont when it was ultimately unveiled on Capitol Hill. Still, Lighty said, there's a nagging question in the back of his mind. ""You have to ask, if Bernie's not there, what will she do? Because she says, 'I'm with Bernie,' and if Bernie is not there, what will she do?"" he said. ""So I think you have to ask those questions. I don't think I would consider her commitment and policy approach settled on Medicare for All."" Another front in the battle The simmering skepticism among some dedicated Medicare for All activists is also rooted in a less-talked-about health care battle.  Warren, along with fellow Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, pushed as recently as early 2018 for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act's tax on medical devices, an industry with a hub in the Bay State. The tax, which Republicans often targeted during Obama-era legislative standoffs over the health care law, was meant to help offset some of its new costs. A Warren aide noted to CNN that her support for repealing the tax has been contingent on lawmakers finding an appropriate source of alternative revenue. She has since become more vocal in her criticism of big pharmaceutical and insurance companies, railing against their multibillion-dollar profits at a time when millions of Americans can't foot the bill for life-saving drugs or coverage. And  in a video released last week  of her recent conversation on health care with Ady Barkan, a 35-year-old activist with ALS, Warren went a step further in assuring even the most hardline single-payer advocates. Barkan noted that Warren appeared to have become increasingly ""full-throated"" in her support of Medicare for All. ""My observation is that your political philosophical approach to a system failure is generally not to expand the size of the public sector, but to instead heavily regulate private sector actors and beat down their greed,"" Barkan said. ""Was that the source of your initial hesitation on the question of getting rid of private insurance, or was it something else?"" Warren gently pushed back, saying her concerns had more to do with the ""transition than on (the) end point."" But she then made a point that, for a candidate who so often argues that well-regulated markets can conquer corporate excess, amounted to a notable admission that health care was different. ""There are areas where markets just don't work, and a big part of health care is one of those,"" Warren said. ""So the idea that we'd get a couple regulations in place, and it'll all -- it'll all sort itself out, it's just not true with health care."""
"The market reaction would likely have been much greater were it not for the substantial increase in US crude production over the past decade. From 2008 to 2018, US crude oil production more than doubled, from 5 million barrels a day to almost 11 million barrels a day,  according  to the Energy Information Agency. Much of that increase has been the result of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. By some estimates, fracked oil wells accounted for more than half of US oil production in 2018. Many 2020 Democratic contenders  support  a ban on fracking. Recently, two of the top three, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have suggested that as president they would work to ban fracking in the US.   Beyond the market implications that such a move would have, it raises obvious political and legal questions, chief among them: Does the President actually have the authority to ban fracking?  Facts First:  Without an act of Congress, the President could not issue an outright ban on fracking across the US. There are however a number of regulatory and executive actions an administration could take to prevent or shrink the use of fracking technology, particularly on federal land. The problem is that most fracking takes place on private land, and any attempts to limit it  would likely face legal challenges. On Sept. 4,  Sanders  wrote  that ""any proposal to avert the climate crisis must include a full fracking ban on public and private lands."" Two days later, Warren struck a similar note,  tweeting  Sept. 6 that on day one of her presidency she would ""sign an executive order that puts a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands. And I will ban fracking—everywhere."" First, a few facts about fracking: Fracking is a controversial method of drilling that involves shooting high pressure water, sand and other compounds underground to make small fractures in rock to release oil and gas. While the practice has led to a drilling boom in the US, it's not been without controversy. Specifically, there have been questions about the effect it has on drinking water, and methane emissions, and it's even been tied to a rise in earthquakes.  The US Geological Survey  determined  that a few earthquakes in Oklahoma have been linked to fracking-related practices -- specifically from the disposal of wastewater -- and the  EPA  ""found scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.""  That, along with rising public concern over the climate crisis, has made fracking a particular target of environmentalists and politicians.   But how far could a president go in simply banning the practice? According to experts, any efforts could present a rocky road of legal challenges.   ""A President can't unilaterally ban fracking on private lands,"" says Christopher Guith, senior VP of the US Chamber of Commerce's Global Energy Institute, ""but a motivated President could embark on a regulatory agenda that would make fracking economically impossible.""   Guith noted that these tactics would face a great deal of legal challenges from states, businesses and local governments. That's essentially what happened under President Barack Obama, whose administration attempted to increase regulations on fracking, and yet was largely thwarted in the courts. In 2015, the federal government  issued  a series of fracking regulations through the Bureau of Land Management that were meant to protect water resources and force companies to disclose the chemicals used in fracking. Wyoming and Colorado filed petitions for judicial review on the new rules and in 2016 a federal district court judge held that the administration's regulations were unlawful. According to the opinion on the case by Judge Scott Skavdahl, the court  found  ""that the Bureau of Land Management lacked Congressional authority to promulgate the regulations."" This story might repeat itself if an administration tried to reinterpret countless federal regulations in, for instance, the Safe Drinking Water Act or the Underground Injection Control programs -- which regulate, among other things, the disposal of wastewater from fracking -- to try and curb fracking on private land.   So how would these candidates look to thwart fracking? Warren's campaign suggested she would focus on getting a bill through Congress, though that would be difficult if the Republicans maintain their majority in the Senate.   ""Elizabeth will fight for legislation to ban fracking nationwide,"" Saloni Sharma, Warren's deputy national press secretary, told CNN. ""She'll build on the Obama administration's methane rule and use executive authorities to regulate contaminants to our air and water as a result of fracking and other natural gas operations.""   Sanders' plan would take similar actions, using rules and regulations -- among other tactics -- like the Clean Air Act and the Safe Water Act to work toward eliminating fracking, his campaign says.     An anti-fracking administration could also try to pass new regulations at the EPA that would make fracking less economically feasible, like the Obama administration tried to do with coal. Yet, without the help of Congress, that route would likely run into similar problems.   After a cap-and-trade bill died in the Senate following  passage in the House  in 2009, the Obama administration tried to limit greenhouse gas emissions through the EPA and its 2014 Clean Power Plan.   The plan, however, was immediately met with lawsuits and  never took effect . The EPA received a halt order from the Supreme Court in 2016 until a lower court had ruled on it. Eventually the Trump administration  repealed  the Clean Power Plan while the case was still bouncing around in the courts. In order to prevent fracking on US private lands, a Warren or Sanders administration would likely have to work through regulatory powers which would ultimately face a myriad of legal challenges. Or they could try their luck in working with Congress to pass new laws on fracking. Any federal regulations, however, would likely be undone by a future administration who supports or is not as hostile toward fracking."
"Political analyst Ron Meyer and Democratic strategist Jason Nichols react to the Democratic debate. The New York Times has detailed how Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., came to be fixated on Canada's health care system. That fixation manifested itself again during the Democratic  presidential  debate in Houston. It started with an illness that befell his mother while  Sanders  was in high school. His family struggled to pay for her care, until she died in 1960, in her mid-40s. That experience ""instilled in him the desire to ensure everyone had access to medical care,"" as the Times put it. A quarter-century later, after he'd made his home in Vermont, a trip across the border to Canada convinced him that American  health care  was ""barbaric"" -- and that the United States needed to follow the example of its neighbor to the north. DANA PERINO: BIDEN AND WARREN WON DEMOCRATIC DEBATE, BETO 'CLOSED OFF ANY FUTURE ELECTED OFFICE FOR HIMSELF' But Sanders has it backwards. The American health care system is not barbaric. In fact, patients of all kinds -- including those like his mother -- fare far worse in Canada. Sanders contends that Canadians can ""go to the doctor whenever they wanted and not have to take out their wallet."" That's not exactly true. Last year, the median wait for treatment from a specialist following referral from a general practitioner in Canada was just under 20 weeks, according to the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based think tank. In some provinces, patients faced median waits of more than 40 weeks for specialist treatment. These wait times can make ""free"" health care quite expensive. For instance, many patients can't work while they're waiting for treatment -- and so they forego thousands of dollars in income. All told, wait times cost Canadians $2.1 billion Canadian dollars (CDNs) in 2018. That's equivalent to $1,924 CDN for each and every person waiting. Those estimates only take into account the 40 hours in a standard workweek. Factor in the other 16 hours in a day and the weekend, and the cost climbs to $6.3 billion CDN, or $5,860 CDN per patient. Waits are so bad that some patients pay out of pocket to seek treatment elsewhere. Canadian ""medical tourists"" have left the country for everything from an $800 CDN MRI to an $18,000 CDN hip replacement to avoid waits. Last year, Canadians made up to 323,700 trips abroad for medical care, according to SecondStreet.org, a think tank. These costs are on top of the taxes that all Canadians must pay to fund their health care system: more than $4,500 CDN for the average single adult, and over $13,300 CDN for the average family of four, in 2018. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER That's a lot to pay for subpar care. Consider that in 2018, Canada had fewer than three doctors, and fewer than three beds, for every 1,000 residents. Canada also has less than 16 CT scanners for every million people. The United States has nearly three times as many of these devices, which are used to diagnose a number of diseases, including cancer. Like Sanders, I've watched my own mother struggle to gain access to needed care. But my mother was deprived by the Canadian system Sanders admires so much. After experiencing severe stomach pain, my mother requested a colonoscopy. Doctors delayed her procedure several times so younger people on the waiting list could go first. By the time she received her procedure, it was too late to treat the colon cancer it uncovered. Because of this lack of equipment and personnel, Canadian patients have worse access to cancer screenings and higher mortality rates for certain cancers, relative to U.S. patients. Sanders may believe that Canadian-style universal coverage would prevent tragedies like the one visited upon his mother. But Canada's health care system is chock full of patients who have suffered, or even died, despite having government-sponsored health insurance. That's because access to coverage does not equal access to care. Take Sharon Shemblaw, a 46-year-old mother of three from Ontario diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in August 2015, according to reporting from the Toronto Star. Doctors told Shemblaw a stem-cell transplant would give her an 80 percent chance of survival. But her local hospitals didn't have the resources to treat her. So Shemblaw sought treatment in the United States. Like Sanders, Shemblaw's daughter Amanda took time off from school to take care of her. But by the time she made it to Buffalo for treatment, it was too late. Shemblaw died in May 2016. Like Sanders, I've watched my own mother struggle to gain access to needed care. But my mother was deprived by the Canadian system Sanders admires so much. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP After experiencing severe stomach pain, my mother requested a colonoscopy. Doctors delayed her procedure several times so younger people on the waiting list could go first. By the time she received her procedure, it was too late to treat the colon cancer it uncovered. The American health care system is far from perfect. But if Sanders were serious about helping families like his, he'd leave the Canadian health care model on the other side of the border.

"In remarks that were applauded by some of his rivals on stage in Houston and many other people, he added, ""We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.""  Sizing up the performance of the 10 candidates, debate coach  Todd Graham  awarded O'Rourke an ""A"" for his ""powerful"" gun control argument:  ""His genuineness was evident,""  wrote Graham.  But as  Zachary Wolf  wrote, the politics of taking away any variety of guns is complicated:  ""Republicans have been warning for decades that Democrats will try to take weapons away from gun owners.""  Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were among those who argued ""that they absolutely would not,"" but instead only sought to improve gun safety laws.  On the controversial idea of replacing all private health insurance with a government plan, advocates like Senator Elizabeth Warren insisted that voters will welcome the change: ""I've actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company."" (Polls suggest otherwise, as  Harry Enten wrote .) Like O'Rourke, Warren may be walking a tightrope as she appeals to the progressive Democratic base while looking ahead to the possibility of a race against President Donald Trump, in which centrist voters may be key, and in which her debate remarks could be targets of opposition advertising. ""For the first time, the socialists were on their heels and the moderates were on the attack,"" wrote  Paul Begala . "" In the ABC debate, we finally had a vigorous, honest debate about Medicare for All.  Gone were the disingenuous digs of prior debates ('You're repeating Republican talking points!') In their place was a substantive critique about cost, choice, and banning employer-provided health care."" Ready for Trump? Frida Ghitis  was impressed. "" The night was a win for the Democratic Party.  That's because candidates repeatedly reminded viewers that despite their differences, the men and women jousting for the presidential nomination embrace views that align more closely with theirs.""  E.J. Dionne , writing in the Washington Post, noted, ""After spending the first half-hour of Thursday's debate tearing each other apart over health care — which happens to be their party's strongest issue —  the Democratic presidential candidates realized that their opponent is President Trump and acted accordingly. "" But are they ready for that general election battle? There were moments for the Democrats to celebrate, wrote  David Gergen . "" But they are kidding themselves if they think any of the candidates is yet ready to slug it out with Trump ...it is still devilishly difficult to know how much their promises will cost and how they will be paid for by just taxing the rich. If they wait much longer to define their budget plans, they will find Republicans defining them for them — and it won't be pleasant."" The Castro moment SE Cupp  was unequivocal about the remarks of another Texas candidate: ""Julián Castro just effectively ended his bid for President. Usually adept at navigating these debates and using his time to his advantage, tonight he looked petty, puerile and, well, like a jerk."" She was referring to Castro badgering Biden during a discussion of health care (""Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?"") The former HUD secretary denied afterward that he was trying to make an issue of Biden's memory and age, but Cupp was among many who saw it as exactly such a play:   ""Attacking Biden -- more than once -- for 'forgetting' what he'd just said was a not subtle (and fairly dishonest) attempt at making Biden look feeble and out of it. Then, flatly declaring that, through their respective health care plans, he was carrying out Obama's legacy and Biden wasn't was  an ugly, personal and unnecessary attack to make his point .""  Barack Obama, as it happened, fared much better in this debate than last time, when candidates questioned his policies.  In fact, Biden seemed more determined than ever to cling to Obama's popularity in the party, wrote CNN commentator and former Obama strategist  David Axelrod . ""The former vice president might well be overdoing it — but there is a lot of upside to touting his friend, the former president... He knows that he will rise or fall with the president who brought him to the dance. ""  Obama's attorney general,  Eric Holder , wrote before the debate that the work of Obama and other Democratic presidents is  one ""in which every Democrat should take pride  — and upon which our next standard-bearer must campaign, rather than attack by accepting as real Republican talking points.""  Many credited Biden with an improved debate performance this time, but several of the other nine contenders also got high marks.  Julian Zelizer  commended Elizabeth Warren for a methodical strategy that has boosted her standing: ""Focusing on policy, focusing on her message, focusing on her life story, focusing on issue-based statements has  allowed her to run a formidable campaign. ""  'A better idea'  After six people died and hundreds developed illnesses attributed to vaping, President Trump proposed banning flavored e-cigarettes. ""It's not a shock that a largely untested and unregulated industry based on inhaling various mysterious substances might have health consequences,"" wrote  David Perry . ""Still, Trump's announcement of a total ban on flavored e-cigarettes seems a little extreme. If he suddenly wants to think of the children and save American lives,  here's a better idea: enact meaningful gun regulations. "" For the first time last year, the number of deaths from gun violence exceeded that from auto accidents.  Former assistant secretary of labor  David Michaels  wrote that, the country's leading e-cigarette maker ""Juul denies targeting teenagers, and the company's approach to gaining market share follows the now  time-honored Silicon Valley startup playbook: Break the rules and ask forgiveness after you've dominated the marke t. But now, after they've been caught and are in the asking-forgiveness phase, the company is under pressure to show evidence that e-cigarettes are less harmful than the traditional type."" He called for the industry to fund research, but leave the control of those experiments to scientists. Alyssa Milano and Ted Cruz The activist-actress and the conservative senator met, and agreed to disagree.  But it was worthwhile anyway, wrote  Alyssa Milano  after her chat with Ted Cruz: "" He is a real person. He isn't a villain in a movie. He cares when these shootings happen.  When people on my side of this fight say he doesn't, they're wrong. I hope he came away with the fact that we are caring people, and supporters of the Second Amendment, just not unlimited gun rights."" Cruz thanked Milano via Twitter for a ""positive, civil &  substantive discussion."" Exit John Bolton It's surprising that John Bolton lasted as long as he did in the Trump administration , wrote  Julian Zelizer . But last week, he was shown the door.  As  Peter Bergen  noted, ""On so many issues -- North Korea, Iran, and Venezuela --  President Trump's national security adviser's bellicose views and advice repeatedly clashed with those of his mercurial boss. ""   'Hung up' on a word Speaker Nancy Pelosi called an abrupt end to her press conference Thursday, after saying reporters were ""hung up"" on the word ""impeachment."" This followed the House Judiciary Committee's vote that day setting the rules of its impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump.  The committee said it will go beyond the bounds of special counsel Robert Mueller's report, but legal analyst  Elie Honig  offered a more far-reaching proposal: forget the Mueller report and concentrate on allegations that Trump has sought to enrich himself personally through the presidency.  ""When I was a new Justice Department prosecutor preparing for one of my first trials, a supervisor gave me a valuable piece of strategic advice:  Go for the jugular, not every capillary.  Don't get bogged down trying to prove every detail of every last bad act or misdeed. Instead, pick out the subject's worst conduct, offer up your strongest proof and make it hit hard.""  In Honig's view, the most damning evidence the House has against Trump is the question of whether he has violated the Constitution's ""emoluments"" clause: ""Just in the past few weeks, we have seen Trump stumping for, and receiving, official business at his private properties. Trump openly contemplated hosting the next G7 summit at his own property in Florida."" Such an investigation would be full of obstacles. Former Justice Department and Senate Judiciary Committee official  Elliot Williams  wrote: the Trump administration has  ""an unprecedented level of contempt for Congress and its constitutional duty to oversee the executive branch.""  ""In a display of arrogance that would have been unheard of in any prior administration, the current administration has, on at least 30 occasions, refused or delayed turning documents over to Congress,"" wrote Williams.

Legal analyst  Joey Jackson  wrote that a judge was right to send actress Felicity Huffman to jail in the college admissions cheating scandal, but also that the short term of 14 days made complete sense: ""Huffman's conduct following the exposure of these crimes has exemplified grace, contrition, remorse and acceptance of responsibility.  Instead of making endless excuses, trying to justify her behavior, and directing blame at others, she has owned her actions. That matters ."" Looking more broadly, he wrote, ""This whole scandal demonstrates how people with money and privilege have nearly unlimited opportunities to perpetuate their family's high status. The rest of society has to play by the rules. Not everyone has the resources necessary to pay someone to take their children's SAT exam, or bribe a proctor to correct the test after it's taken. As such, the less privileged are forced to implore their children to work hard, get good grades, and do their best to stand out among their peers.""  In TIME's Ideas section,  Daniel Markovits  traced the factors that power inequality in schools and universities: "" The elite invests unprecedented time and money in educating its children . Rich parents pay for art, music, and sports lessons, hire tutors and, critically, send their children to schools that spend many times more on educating their students than middle-class schools...""

Pierce Brosnan, who played James Bond in four films, said it's about time the character of the British secret agent was re-conceived as a woman.  That's the last thing we need, wrote  Holly Thomas :  Sure, ""women are every bit as capable of playing seductive alcoholics with gambling issues as men are, and it would be wonderful to see how a female star made the part her own.""  Still, "" updating Bond by way of Adam's rib-ing him into a woman distracts from the necessity of characters and franchises which belong to women from the beginning ."" Thomas noted that the female heroes who already exist are commercial successes: Take Gal Gadot in ""Wonder Woman"" or Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh in ""Killing Eve.""   ""One of the loveliest things about Gal Gadot's portrayal of Wonder Woman was that it didn't inhabit the traditional male template for a comic book hero. Rather than 'beat the guys at their game,' she played it on her own terms. She was tender and vulnerable, and her willingness to bring softness to the role -- cooing at a baby, gasping at the flavor of ice cream -- made the character multifaceted, and no less convincing a warrior."""
"""Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,"" O'Rourke said in a standout moment at the ABC News Democratic presidential debate Thursday. His comment  frustrated some lawmakers on Capitol Hill  who are trying to find a way forward on gun legislation that Republicans and Democrats can agree on.  Buttigieg said Sunday he agrees with those who say O'Rourke's comment plays into the hands of Republicans. The South Bend, Indiana, mayor argued now is a ""golden moment"" to pass gun legislation, telling CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" that the majority of Americans support so-called red flag laws, banning high-capacity magazines and prohibiting the sale of assault weapons.  ""When even this President and even (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell are at least pretending to be open to reforms, we know that we have a moment on our hands,"" Buttigieg said. ""Let's make the most of it and get these things done."" O'Rourke fired back at Buttigieg on Twitter  and wrote, ""Leaving millions of weapons of war on the streets because Trump and McConnell are 'at least pretending to be open to reforms'?"" ""That calculation and fear is what got us here in the first place,"" he continued. ""Let's have the courage to say what we believe and fight for it."" O'Rourke is one of three Democrats, along with Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, to support mandatory buybacks for certain guns. Other Democrats,  including Buttigieg , would make them illegal but not require them to be bought back by the government. The former Texas congressman received praise from fellow Democratic contenders during Thursday's debate for his actions following the  mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, where 22 people  were gunned down at a Walmart in August. His campaign heightened its focus on firearms in America in the wake of the shooting.  But his blunt ""Hell, yes,"" comment had some lawmakers, like Delaware Democrat and Sen. Chris Coons, arguing O'Rourke's comment feeds into a long-propagated conservative talking point that making any changes on gun laws, however minor, could lead to Democrats eventually forcing people to give up their guns. ""I frankly think that that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns,"" Coons told CNN Friday morning.  O'Rourke defended his comment in an interview with CNN Friday, insisting it would not hurt the Democratic Party.  ""It's not a concern of mine and that's in part informed by listening to people in conservative parts of America,"" O'Rourke said. ""And folks are saying, 'Look, I would give up that AR-15 or that AK-47. I don't need it to hunt, don't need it to defend myself in my home.' They recognize this is a weapon designed for war, to kill people as effectively, as efficiently, and in a great a number as possible."""
"But a deeply personal moment on the campaign trail Friday spoke to how much the issue of affordable health care affects Americans.  Fresh from the Democratic debate , the Vermont senator began his two-day swing in Nevada with a town hall, where people opened up and got intensely personal about their issues with health care. During the Friday event in Carson City, a Navy veteran named John shared with Sanders that he is $139,000 in debt because his health insurance, Tricare, a program for the military, is no longer accepted.  Sanders listened intently as John, who said he served 20 years in the military, revealed that he has been diagnosed with stage four Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder.  When asked by Sanders how he is going to pay off his debt, John said, raising his voice, ""I can't, I can't, I'm gonna kill myself."" The senator cut him off -- ""Hold it. John, stop it. You're not gonna kill yourself. Stop it,"" Sanders said. ""I can't do this,"" John said with frustration in his voice. ""I have Huntington's disease. Do you know how hard it is? You know, you probably don't, do you? I can't drive. I can barely take care of myself."" ""Alright, let's chat later at the end of the meeting, okay?"" Sanders said to John. As promised, Sanders and his wife Jane spoke with John after the campaign event ended. Sanders shared with CNN that in this conversation with the veteran, he made sure his team got the correct contact information. ""What I wanted to make sure is that I got the correct information because what I did not want to happen is just him talking about his story but not being able to follow up with him,"" Sanders said.  ""He told me he doesn't answer his phone very much because there are bill collectors calling him up every day,"" Sanders said of what he learned when speaking with the veteran further. Sanders also shared that his team has already gotten in touch with one of the Nevada senators about this veteran's situation.  ""We have already been in contact with one of the Nevada senators. We're going to get in touch with the entire Nevada Congressional delegation to get him the help that he needs,"" the Vermont senator said.   ""We will follow up on Monday,"" Sanders later added. ""Here is somebody who put his life on the line to defend this country, a veteran, dealing with a terrible, terrible illness, and what was obviously very unsettling is when he used the word suicide,"" Sanders told CNN when reflecting on his interaction. ""That was the most dramatic and painful moment of the whole town meeting,"" he added. ""This should not be going on in America, not for a veteran, not for any person in this country, and it is beyond comprehension that under the current healthcare system, somewhere like a half a million people go bankrupt every year because of medical bills,"" Sanders told CNN.  ""Clearly we are not doing what we should be doing to make sure that every veteran in this country gets all of the quality healthcare they need when they need it,"" he said. If you or a veteran you know needs help, call the Veterans Crisis Line at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), and press 1."
"The switch of support comes days after  Castro sharply criticized Biden  -- with an apparent jab at the former vice president's memory -- in a contentious moment  dubbed ""personal"" and ""not cool"" by other candidates , but Gonzalez said that debate moment was not the reason behind his decision.  Castro's ""delivery could have been different,"" Gonzalez told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" but the congressman said most of what he saw on the debate stage was ""fair game in moving the process forward."" Still, the Democratic Party needs to narrow  the 20-person field  to be successful, he said. ""We need to narrow the field and unite as Democrats to defeat (President Donald) Trump in November 2020. That's why I believe I'm moving my support to Vice President Joe Biden,"" Gonzalez, who represents the Texas 15th Congressional District, said.  Gonzalez called the former vice president a ""steady ship"" with White House experience who can defeat Trump. He called Castro, a former housing and urban development secretary under the Obama administration and former mayor of San Antonio, Texas, a qualified candidate, but said there are a number of qualified candidates.  ""If you're polling in the low single digits and you're not raising resources, I mean it's clearly a recipe for disaster,"" Gonzalez said.  In response to the pulled endorsement, Castro campaign spokesman Sawyer Hackett said, ""Congressman González is entitled to endorse whichever candidate he feels represents his values. Secretary Castro will continue to fight for a better future for all Americans, including a health care system that ensures all Americans have access to quality coverage."" During the  third Democratic presidential debate  in Houston and hosted by ABC News Thursday, Castro sharply accused the former vice president of forgetting what he'd said just minutes before during a disagreement over a minor point in the candidates' broader discussion of whether to embrace ""Medicare for All,"" which Biden has opposed. ""Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?"" Castro said to Biden. ""Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? I can't believe that you said -- two minutes ago -- that they had to buy in and now you're forgetting that. We need a health care system where you're automatically enrolled."" The congressman said he recently met with Biden and said he is in ""great health"" and ""mentally sharp."" He said Biden is ""a lot healthier than Donald Trump."" The 76-year-old Biden along with two of his Democratic challengers -- Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 78, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 70 -- have  pledged to release their medical records  before the Iowa caucuses. Trump, 73, was the oldest president at the beginning of his first term in 2017. Gonzalez told Tapper that ""people make mistakes"" and ""misspeak,"" adding: ""But for the most part, (Biden)'s sharp, he's on target, when you meet with him personally he's clearly in physically good shape."""
"Julian Castro questions Joe Biden's recall at the third Democratic debate in Houston; reaction from DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa. A newly surfaced video clip  from 2017  shows  Joe Biden  recounting a bizarre alleged incident in which he deftly avoided a razor-and-chain fight with a gang leader named Corn Pop, when Biden was serving as the only white lifeguard at a predominately black Delaware pool in the summer of 1962. Biden's explanation of how he made Corn Pop stand down was making the rounds on social media as the former vice president was seeking to burnish his credentials with black voters. His extraordinary lifeguarding tale was immediately  questioned by commentators  with sway in the black community -- however, some  corroborating evidence  emerged later in the day Sunday indicating some version of that tale really did happen. The former vice president has long claimed that he  had applied to be a lifeguard at the pool  to better understand black America, and wrote in his 2007 memoir that Corn Pop often tormented him at the pool. For example, Biden said Corn Pop -- the purported leader of a gang called ""the Romans"" -- would insult Biden's mother to distract him so that people could sneak into the pool. ""I learned a lot. And I learned that it makes a difference,"" Biden said in the 2017 video clip, which documented the ceremony in which the  Brown-Burton-Winchester Park  was renamed the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Aquatic Center. The clip was recorded and aired originally by  WITN22 in Wilmington. ""This was the diving board area, and I was one of the guards, and they weren't allowed to -- it was a 3-meter board. And if you fell off sideways, you landed on the damn, er, darn cement over there,"" Biden said. Some members of the crowd laughed, apparently at Biden correcting his language, as a small gathering of black children surrounding Biden looked ahead, seemingly disinterested. ""And Corn Pop was a bad dude. And he ran a bunch of bad boys. And back in those days -- to show how things have changed -- one of the things you had to use, if you used Pomade in your hair, you had to wear a baby cap. And so he was up on the board and wouldn't listen to me. I said, 'Hey, Esther, you! Off the board, or I'll come up and drag you off.' Well, he came off, and he said, 'I'll meet you outside.'"" Biden's comments were a reference to competitive swimmer-turned actress Esther Williams, who died in 2013. ""My car was mostly, these were all public housing behind us,"" Biden continued. ""My car - there was a gate on here. I parked my car outside the gate. And he said, 'I'll be waiting for you. He was waiting for me with three guys with straight razors. Not a joke. There was a guy named Bill Wright the only white guy and he did all the pools. He was a mechanic. And I said, 'What am I gonna do?' And he said. 'Come down here in the basement, where all the mechanics- - where all the pool builder is.' You know the chain, there used to be a chain that went across the deep end. And he cut off a six-foot length of chain, and folded it up and he said, 'You walk out with that chain, and you walk to the car and say, 'you may cut me man, but I'm gonna wrap this chain around your head.'"" BIDEN CLAIMS DETAILS 'IRRELEVANT' AFTER GETTING CAUGHT TELLING FALSE WAR STORY Biden continued: ""I said, 'You're kidding me.'"" He said, 'No if you don't, don't come back.' And he was right. So I walked out with the chain. And I walked up to my car. And in those days, you remember the straight razors, you had to bang 'em on the curb, gettin' em rusty, puttin' em in the rain barrel, gettin' em rusty? And I looked at him, but I was smart, then. I said, 'First of all,' I said, 'when I tell you to get off the board, you get off the board, and I'll kick you out again, but I shouldn't have called you Esther Williams, and I apologize for that. I apologize.' But I didn't know that apology was gonna work."" ""Corn Pop was a bad dude."" ""He said, 'you apologize to me?'"" Biden went on. ""I said, 'I apologize but not for throwing you out, but I apologize for what I said.' He said, 'OK,' closed that straight razor, and my heart began to beat again."" Reaction  to the clip  was a mixture of befuddlement and skepticism. ""What is going on? I'm really confused and I feel like I'm losing my mind,"" journalist Yashar Ali wrote. However, former Delaware NAACP President Richard Smith  corroborated Biden's account , saying the former vice president “stood his ground"" despite Corn Pop's aggression. And, contemporaneous newspaper reports uncovered by CNN reporter Daniel Dale revealed that an individual nicknamed ""Corn Pop"" did live in Wilmington, and died in 2016 at the age of 73. A former Wilmington mayor confirmed that the individual was the same person to whom Biden was referring. Additionally, a gang called ""the Romans"" did exist, Dale found. Speaking after Biden at the 2017 dedication, Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., later referred to the gang leader as ""Pop Corn,"" and told attendees that Biden's story was ""special"" because it ""showed the kind of man that Joe Biden is."" ""He wasn't afraid to be the only white lifeguard here,"" Rochester said. ""He never shied away. And so, to me, this pool is really representative of this man. ... This pool acts as an inspiration to us. He was basically saying, 'stay woke,' before millenials were saying 'stay woke.' And, that's the situation we're in right now. And so, this pool is a representation of you. We love you. Thank you so much for all of your service."" But, others had their doubts. ""They told Biden that Corn Pop carried a straight razor and was gonna be waiting for him when he got off work,""  wrote The Root's Michael Harriott.  ""Now you and I both know that, if this was true, Biden would've just called the cops to walk him to the car."" Harriott added: ""Anyway, Biden says, instead he wrapped a 6-foot metal chain around his arm and wrapped that in a towel. Because everyone knows there are ample black chains just laying around the 'African-American community' but no police officers."" It's ""already been demonstrably proven Biden will make stuff up,"" Harriott noted. Biden, indeed, earnestly has told inaccurate stories in the past. A headline in The Washington Post last month, for example, read simply: ""As he campaigns for president, Joe Biden tells a moving but false war story."" That incident involved an inaccurate claim by Biden that he had brushed aside security concerns to travel to Afghanistan, on a general's request, to pin a Silver Star on an American soldier who rappelled into a ravine to retrieve a dead comrade. Biden gave his ""word as a Biden"" that he was telling ""God's truth"" as he explained that the soldier resisted Biden's efforts to pin the Silver Star on him. ""Except almost every detail in the story appears to be incorrect,"" the Post found. ""Based on interviews with more than a dozen U.S. troops, their commanders and Biden campaign officials, it appears as though the former vice president has jumbled elements of at least three actual events into one story of bravery, compassion and regret that never happened."" Biden later dismissed concerns about his apparent fabrications as irrelevant. “That has nothing to do with judgment of whether or not you send troops to war, the judgment of whether you bring someone home, the judgment of whether you decide on a health care policy,"" Biden said in comments aired last month by the  NPR  Politics Podcast and Iowa Public Radio. “The details are irrelevant in terms of decision-making.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Commentators also have doubted many of Biden's other claims. For instance, The Washington Free Beacon's Alex Griswold reacted with skepticism to a Biden story about how his father, in the 1950s, had reacted to the site of two men kissing by telling his son: ""Joey, they love each other, it's simple."" ""Oh sure, I absolutely believe that Joe Biden saw two men kissing publicly in the 1950s, and that his Irish-Catholic father reacted by approving of it,"" Griswold wrote."

"Todd Starnes speaks with Fox News Contributor and Author Mollie Hemingway about the continued attacks from the left and Democrats on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The New York Times'  supposed bombshell allegations  against  Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh  are part of a coordinated effort to damage him, according to Mollie Hemingway. The political left is focused on undermining and delegitimizing the  Trump-nominated  justice because they do not agree with his legal perspective, Hemingway  claimed Monday  on "" The Todd Starnes Show ."" ""I think it's obviously part of a coordinated effort,"" she said. ""There are multiple books coming out to try to sort of re-go-through the #MeToo movement and make it seem like it had less downsides than it clearly did."" NYT UPDATES KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' TO NOTE ACCUSER DOESN'T RECALL ALLEGED ASSAULT Hemingway, who with Carrie Severino co-authored the book ""Justice on Trial,"" about the Kavanaugh Hearings,  told Starnes  an attorney for a woman who previously accused the justice of sexual misconduct referenced a similar intent ""It's really just part of a larger coordination, an ongoing attempt to -- as Christine Blasey Ford's attorney admitted on video --  to put an 'asterisk'  next to Brett Kavanaugh,"" the Fox News contributor said. ""They wanted to make sure that whatever he did as a judge they could tarnish. They admitted their motivation was their support for abortion-on-demand."" The high-powered progressive lawyer, Debra Katz, made the remarks at the  University of Baltimore’s 11th Feminist Legal Theory Conference . Her comments were first quoted in the book ""Search and Destroy: Inside the Campaign Against Brett Kavanaugh"" by Ryan Lovelace,  which Fox News has obtained . KAVANAUGH ACCUSER'S LAWYER SAID ALLEGATIONS COULD HELP UNDERMINE ABORTION RULINGS: 'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED CHRISTINE' “In the aftermath of these hearings, I believe that Christine’s testimony brought about more good than the harm misogynist Republicans caused by allowing Kavanaugh on the court,”  Katz said in the video . “He will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important."" On "" The Todd Starnes Show ,"" Hemingway added such statements from Katz and the Times should not be surprising. ""It seems like just another day, and exactly what they do,"" she said. ""When Carrie and I wrote the book... we talked about how this is the game plan -- you throw out unsubstantiated, unsupported allegations to try to destroy someone. And then, when it doesn't work, you keep the game plan going."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In addition, Hemingway claimed the continued criticisms of and allegations against Kavanaugh ring similar to that of the 1991 confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Hemingway said many Americans were similarly skeptical of the goings-on in the hearings -- which were overseen by current Democratic presidential candidate and then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman  Joe Biden , D-Del. ""A vast majority of Americans found [Thomas' accuser Anita Hill] lacking in credibility,"" she claimed. On Sunday , The New York Times suddenly  made a major revision  to the  piece  concerning a resurfaced allegation of sexual assault by Kavanaugh — hours after virtually all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates had cited the original article as a reason to  impeach him. The  update  included the significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim, Harmon Joyce, said she did not recall the purported sexual assault in question at all. The Times also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode.

"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 15 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Beto O’Rourke  launched an expletive-fueled defense of his call Sunday to ban assault-style weapons and impose mandatory buybacks of AR-15s and AK-47s while also pushing back at critics — including fellow 2020 Democrat  Pete Buttigieg .  During last Thursday’s  presidential debate , the former Texas congressman said, “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47, and we’re not going to allow it to be used against your fellow Americans anymore.” Three days later, O’Rourke appeared on NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” where host Chuck Todd pointed out that there was “a lot of hand-wringing” about the presidential contender’s full-throated call on national TV for confiscating such rifles. As O’Rourke has put the issue of gun violence at the center of his campaign effort, some fellow Democrats have chastised him and expressed concern that his statements may have made things harder for gun control supporters as they negotiate with President Trump on legislation to respond to this summer’s mass shootings. O'ROURKE CLAIMS TRUMP HAS 'BLOOD... ON HIS HANDS' AFTER EL PASO MASS SHOOTING After Todd pointed out that some Democrats were hesitant to support such bans, O’Rourke responded, “I think this just shows you how screwed up the priorities in Washington, D.C. are.” He then brought up the  22 people killed  in a Walmart in his hometown of  El Paso  last month. “Talking to those doctors and trauma room surgeons who treated those victims in El Paso, they said these are wounds of war — that high-impact, high-velocity round, when it hit their systems, just shredded everything inside of them,” O’Rourke said on Sunday. “I refuse to accept that, and I refuse to even acknowledge the politics, or the polling, or the fear of the NRA that has purchased the complicity and silence of members of Congress and this weak response to a real tragedy in America.”  EL PASO SHOOTING FATALITIES NOW AT 22 AFTER VICTIM DIES AT HOSPITAL MONDAY MORNING, POLICE SAY Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” and agreed with Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., saying the clip of the former O’Rourke’s statement about AR-15s and AK-47s “will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns.”   Buttigieg said, “Look, right now we have an amazing moment on our hands. We have agreement among the American people not just for universal backgrounds checks, but we have a majority in favor of red-flag laws, high-capacity magazines, banning the new sale of assault weapons. This is a golden moment to finally do something.” Buttigieg went on to say, “When even this president and even [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell are at least are pretending to be open to reforms, we know that we have a moment on our hand. Let’s make the most of it and get these things done.”  O’Rourke pushed back in a  tweet:  “Leaving millions of weapons of war on the streets because Trump and McConnell are ‘at least pretending to be open to reforms’? That calculation and fear is what got us here in the first place. Let’s have the courage to say what we believe and fight for it.” He later  tweeted,  “When candidates say, 'At least Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are pretending to be interested,' sh--, that is not enough. Neither is poll-testing your message. Gun violence is a life or death issue—and we have to represent the bold ideas of people all over the country.” As O’Rourke made his call to take back the rifles on Thursday night, Trump warned at a  Republican retreat in Baltimore , “Democrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans, so they are totally defenseless when somebody walks into their house.” Trump promised that his party “will forever uphold the fundamental right to keep and bear arms,” which received loud applause.

"California Democrat Rep. Katie Hill says she would like to see more information on the attack before blaming Iran. “No blood for oil.” It’s a common slogan I’ve heard since the first Gulf War when I was a high school student. It was often repeated during the more recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It’s meaning? American men and women should not lose their lives to protect the oil supply in the  Middle East . I agree wholeheartedly. IRAN'S AGGRESSION DEMANDS GLOBAL RESPONSE, RICK PERRY SAYS: ‘WHO IS NEXT?’ I hate war. I hate the idea of war and I hate that the millions of American 18-year-olds preparing to vote in their first-ever election have been born into a time of perpetual warfare. I hate that every overseas conflict from South America to the Middle East to Asia, even still in Europe, presupposes that our American military must be deployed to keep the peace. I hate that the leader of the free world is somehow responsible for the shipping lanes in the Pacific, the tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, and cargo in the Mediterranean and the North Sea. I hate that when Somali pirates terrorized commercial and recreational ships it meant that America had to step in and stop it. No blood for oil. Everyone who carried this idea, not just as a banner at a rally, but as a virtue in their heart, should be relieved that American energy independence, finally realized under the policies of President Donald Trump, means “no blood for oil.” And that’s true even when the world’s oil supply is threatened.  Attacks this weekend on Saudi oil fields, presumably carried out by their enemy Iran, will have tremendous negative consequences for the world’s oil supply and economy. These brazen attacks have temporarily cut off more than 50 percent of Saudi oil from reaching the global market, and that threatens business, in every nation, because Saudi Arabia is the world’s second-largest oil producer. But America is  now  number one.   Being the world’s largest oil producer is a blessing. Our great allies in the European Union have an enormous vulnerability that should keep their entire team of defense and security experts awake all night. Why? Because they are not energy independent. More than  50  percent of EU nations’ energy is imported, the vast majority from Russia, some from America, but a lot from Saudi Arabia. What will happen to European commerce as a result of the Saudi oil field attack? How about  gas prices?  What about shipping costs on consumer goods? Can the European economy, already in a Jimmy Carter-style “malaise,” absorb the risk of losing its energy imports? America is in a stronger position now than it was ten years ago when similar geopolitical circumstances caused oil prices to skyrocket to an all-time high of $ 146  a barrel. Back then we were only producing  5  million barrels a day domestically.  Today we are producing over  12  million and that number continues to grow every day. Energy independence means that when Iran threatens Saudi Arabia and takes millions of barrels of oil off the global oil market, America persists unaffected. It means when the ongoing socialist nightmare in  Venezuela , the nation with the largest proven oil reserves in the world, takes millions of barrels of their oil off the global oil market, America persists. “She persisted” is, of course, the manufactured slogan associated with Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. The senator from Massachusetts, like all of the 2020 presidential candidates, would presumably embrace a “no blood for oil” mantra and speak passionately about the need for increased diplomacy.  The Democratic candidates might even remind us of President Obama’s “Iran deal” which provided the terrorist nation with  billions  of dollars, much of it in cash. One can only hope that Iran didn’t use that money for military purposes, say, attacking their enemy’s oil supply. Regardless of our political persuasion, we can all agree for once on this: there should be no blood for oil. The difference from previous Middle East energy crises is that today we are pursuing an energy policy that assures we will not shed American blood for oil. We are eliminating burdensome regulations; we are opening up land to responsible energy development; we are seeing hundreds of thousands of people find jobs in the energy sector, move off government dependence, provide for the families and communities, all while lowering CO2 emissions and cleaning up our air and our water. The energy policies of the 2020 presidential candidates and their dangerous, asinine “Green New Deal” means exactly the opposite. It means “Yes, blood for oil.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER It means making America like Europe: beholden to a foreign power for its energy. It means that the cost of food and home utility bills and gasoline prices are tied to the temperance of the mullahs of Iran’s Shia theocracy. It ties our economy to the stability of the Middle East. For years I have heard the “no blood for oil,” refrain and I thought I knew what it meant. Maybe those who said it meant it as the reductionist phrase of naïve peaceniks. But that’s not the case. No, it is now the proud phrase of American exceptionalism celebrating our energy independence.  And right now, in coal mines and in fracking fields and on oil rigs and ocean platforms across this nation, there are millions of American energy workers whose toil and sweat mean that our energy security is sovereignty. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Their labor in our energy industry means fewer of our brave military will go overseas to protect, fight, and die, for America’s interests. It is thanks to the energy worker, not the leftist protester or the delusional 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, that today in America we have finally achieved “no blood for oil.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DANIEL TURNER"

"Campaign Trail Mix: Elizabeth Warren makes her appeal to older voters with Social Security expansion plan and Sen. Ted Cruz accepts a charity basketball challenge from Andrew Yang. After supporting  Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont  in 2016, the Working Families Party on Monday endorsed  Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  for the Democratic presidential nomination. The backing by the progressive organization that’s aligned with the labor movement  gives Warren  a boost as she and fellow populist Sanders battle for the mantle of progressive standard-bearer among the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls. TAKING AIM AT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND LOBBYISTS, WARREN UNVEILS WIDE-RANGING ANTI-CORRUPTION PLAN “We’re committed to helping Elizabeth Warren win — and to organizing in our communities and online to make sure that the issues that matter to working families remain at the center of this primary campaign,” the group emphasized on Twitter. Warren won the endorsement through an online vote, grabbing 61 percent of support from WFP members and supporters. Sanders was a distant second, at 36 percent. In the 2016 Democratic primaries, the independent senator from Vermont captured 87 percent of the vote, easily landing the party’s 2016 endorsement over eventual nominee Hillary Clinton. WFP national director Maurice Mitchell noted that, ""Senator Warren and Senator Sanders have both shaped the ideological terrain on which this campaign is being waged.” “They have proven an effective team on debate stages and in the polls, and we hope that partnership continues. We're proud to call both of them allies in the fight for a more just America,” he added. The New York City-based group has been expanding its operations since the start of President Trump’s tenure in the White House. Last year it backed progressive Cynthia Nixon in her unsuccessful primary challenge against Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York State."
"'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the New York Times' flawed 'bombshell' Brett Kavanaugh story that has been widely panned. Leland Keyser , a friend of Christine Blasey Ford who allegedly was at the party where Ford says Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her decades ago, now says the story ""just didn't make any sense."" That revelation is contained in a forthcoming book, by New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, titled ""The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation."" But the Times omitted any reference to Keyser's comments in a  widely panned  article this weekend by Pogrebin and Kelly that was adapted from the book. NYT FORCED TO ISSUE EDITORS' NOTE, ADDING INFORMATION THAT ALLEGED VICTIM DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER SUPPOSED ASSAULT The Times' article instead  included an uncorroborated allegation  from a  Clinton-linked lawyer  claiming Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted a female student, without mentioning that the student did not recall the events in question. The Times later  published a major update to include those details, along with an editors' note , but not before virtually all major Democratic presidential candidates had called for Kavanaugh's impeachment. Specifically, Keyser challenged Ford's narrative that sometime in the summer of 1982, Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge assaulted her at a party also attended by Keyser and P.J. Smith. ""I don’t have any confidence in the story,” Keyser told the reporters of Ford's claims, according to outlets that have  reviewed  advance  copies  of the  forthcoming book . ""Those facts together I don't recollect, and it just didn't make any sense,"" Keyser added. ""Those facts together I don't recollect, and it just didn't make any sense."" Ford has been unable to identify exactly where or when the alleged assault occurred, or how she got home after the incident. Keyser reportedly remarked: ""It would be impossible for me to be the only girl at a get-together with three guys, have her leave, and then not figure out how she's getting home."" Keyser told Pogrebin and Kelly, ""I just really didn't have confidence in the story."" 
      Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
       (AP, File) Last year, Keyser, speaking through her attorney, said she could not corroborate Ford's claims. Keyser told the FBI  she felt pressured by partisan activists and Ford's friends to change her account  and later revised her statement to indicate that she believed Ford despite her lack of memory of the episode. Keyser's initial statement was that ""Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.” The revised statement from Keyser's attorney read: ""Ms. Keyser does not refute Dr. Ford's account, and she has already told the press that she believes Dr. Ford's account. However, the simple and unchangeable truth is that she is unable to corroborate it because she has no recollection of the incident in question.” 2020 DEMS CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR KAVANAUGH IMPEACHMENT, DESPITE DUD NYT 'BOMBSHELL' GOING BUST The Times' authors, in the book, cast doubt on Keyser's memory, writing that “Keyser’s memory might be affected by her struggles with alcohol and other substances.” Keyser, though, also informed the reporters of an apparent smear campaign directed at her, in an effort to get her to change her story. Ford, in her explosive testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year, indicated that it wasn't surprising Keyser wouldn't remember the episode. ""She didn’t know about the event. She was downstairs during the event and I did not share it with her,” Ford said. Ford added: “Leland has significant health challenges, and I’m happy that she’s focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs, and she let me know that she needed her lawyer to take care of this for her, and she texted me right afterward with an apology and good wishes, and et cetera.” Rather than mention Keyser's latest remarks, the Times' article instead focused on a new accuser mentioned in the book, who was allegedly sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh. But the Times' article omitted key details from the book, including that the accuser herself had no recollection of the event. The Times later published an editors' note adding the information, but not before virtually all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates demanded Kavanaugh's' impeachment. Throughout the day on Sunday,  Kamala Harris ,  Elizabeth Warren ,  Beto O'Rourke ,  Cory Booker  and  Julian Castro , among others, declared that Kavanaugh must be removed from office, citing the allegation. The Times'  update  also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode. The only firsthand account concerning the supposed attack in the original piece, which was published on Saturday, came from a  Clinton-connected lawyer  who claimed to have witnessed it. The lawyer, Max Stier, did not actually provide his account directly; the Times acknowledged that ""two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier"" had relayed his supposed version of events. The Times did not mention  Stier's work as a Clinton defense attorney , or Stier's  legal battles with Kavanaugh  during the Whitewater investigation, and simply called him a ""respected thought leader."" The Times went on to note in the article that it had ""corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier,"" but the article apparently meant only that the Times had corroborated that Stier made his claim to the FBI. No firsthand corroboration of the alleged episode was apparently obtained. The Times' revision stated: ""Editors' Note: An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article."" The Times' update came only after The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway, who reviewed an advance copy of the book,  first flagged the article's omission on Twitter  — prompting other commentators to press the issue. The Times did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News seeking comment. But commentators made clear they felt the paper's note wasn't sufficient.

Wrote the Washington Examiner's Jerry Dunleavy: ""Crazy how the 'one element' that wasn’t included in the original article was the part where the alleged victim’s friends said she doesn’t remember it happening."" For his part, President Trump unloaded on the Times, and suggested Kavanaugh should sue. ""The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh - Assaulted by lies and Fake News!"" Trump wrote. ""This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner, the Dems."" He added: ""DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY. They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions - but played the game badly. They should be sued!"" Separately, the Times' article states that seven new witnesses could corroborate Deborah Ramirez's account that Kavanaugh allegedly exposed himself at a party. Only one of those second-hand witnesses claims to have heard about Kavanaugh's possible involvement at the time,  according to the book , and Ramirez herself previously acknowledged she was not sure Kavanaugh was the culprit. Senate investigators and the FBI were  unable to corroborate Ramirez's claims , and Ramirez did not cooperate with the GOP probe."
"Beto O’Rourke gives his take on the latest sexual assault allegation against a Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh. The New York Times suddenly made a major revision to a  supposed bombshell piece  late Sunday concerning a resurfaced allegation of sexual assault by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh — hours after virtually all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates had cited the original article as a reason to  impeach Kavanaugh. The  update  included the significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim, Harmon Joyce, said she did not recall the purported sexual assault in question at all. The Times also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode. The only firsthand account concerning the supposed attack in the original piece, which was published on Saturday, came from a  Clinton-connected lawyer  who claimed to have witnessed it. (The lawyer, Max Stier, did not actually provide his account directly; the Times acknowledged that ""two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier"" had relayed his supposed version of events.) The Times' revision says: ""Editors' Note: An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article."" Even after the revision, the Times' story still does not mention a separate revelation in the book that  Leland Keyser , the friend of Christine Blasey Ford who was allegedly at the party where Kavanaugh supposedly assaulted her, had specifically rejected Ford's claims. Previously, through her attorney, Keyser had said only that she was ""unable to corroborate it because she has no recollection of the incident in question.” “I don’t have any confidence in the story,” Keyser told the reporters, according to the book. ""Those facts together I don't recollect, and it just didn't make any sense."" The Times' update came only after The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway, who reviewed an advance copy of the book,  first flagged the article's omission on Twitter  — prompting other commentators to press the issue. The Times did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News seeking comment. The paper's editors' note, meanwhile, did little to stem a torrent of criticism late Sunday.

      This undated photo shows Deborah Ramirez. Her uncorroborated allegations that Kavanaugh had exposed himself to her in college – which came after she admitted to classmates that she was unsure Kavanaugh was the culprit, and after she spent several days talking to a lawyer – were reported Sept. 23, 2018, by The New Yorker magazine.

       ""It’s important to point out that this correction almost certainly would have never occurred if conservative media folks like  @MZHemingway   and others hadn’t obtained the copy of the actual book itself the same day the excerpt/article was released,"" author James Hasson said. Throughout the day on Sunday,  Kamala Harris ,  Elizabeth Warren ,  Bernie Sanders ,  Beto O'Rourke ,  Cory Booker  and  Julian Castro , among others, declared that Kavanaugh ""must be impeached,"" citing the allegation. The revitalized, longshot push to get Kavanaugh removed from the high court came as Democrats'  apparent effort to impeach  President Trump has  largely stalled . Trump, for his part,  suggested  Sunday that Kavanaugh should sue for defamation. The Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate,  Clinton-linked  nonprofit CEO  Max Stier , ""saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."" The Times did not mention  Stier's work as a Clinton defense attorney , or Stier's  legal battles with Kavanaugh  during the Whitewater investigation, and simply called him a ""respected thought leader."" According to the Times, Stier ""notified senators and the FBI about this account"" last year during the Kavanaugh hearings, ""but the FBI did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly."" However, the Times' article also conspicuously did not mention that Pogrebin and Kelly's book found that the female student in question had denied any knowledge of the alleged episode. ""The book notes, quietly, that the woman Max Stier named as having been supposedly victimized by Kavanaugh and friends denies any memory of the alleged event,"" observed Mollie Hemingway. ""Seems, I don’t know, significant."" 'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED' CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS TO PUT POLITICAL 'ASTERISK' ON KAVANAUGH, LAWYER ADMITS The book  reads : ""[Tracy] Harmon, whose surname is now Harmon Joyce, has also refused to discuss the incident, though several of her friends said she does not recall it."" ""Omitting these facts from the  @nytimes  story is one of worst cases of journalistic malpractice that I can recall,"" wrote the National Review's Washington correspondent, John McCormack, on Twitter. McCormack  wrote separately : ""If Kavanaugh’s 'friends pushed his penis,' then isn’t it an allegation of wrongdoing against Kavanaugh’s 'friends,' not Kavanaugh himself? Surely even a modern liberal Yalie who’s been to one of those  weird non-sexual 'naked parties ' would recognize both the female student and Kavanaugh are both alleged victims in this alleged incident, barring an additional allegation that a college-aged Kavanaugh asked his 'friends' to 'push his penis.'"" NEW YORK TIMES DELETES TWEET CALLING UNPROVOKED PENIS THRUSTING 'HARMLESS FUN' The Times went on to note in the article that it had ""corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier,"" but the article apparently meant only that the Times had corroborated that Stier made his claim to the FBI. No first-hand corroboration of the alleged episode was apparently obtained. Nevertheless, Democrats announced a new effort to topple Kavanaugh. Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono -- who infamously said last year that Kavanaugh  did not deserve a fair hearing because he might be pro-life  -- said the Senate Judiciary Committee should begin an impeachment inquiry to determine whether Kavanaugh lied to Congress. Impeaching Kavanaugh would require a majority vote in the Democratic-controlled House, and a highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-majority Senate would then be needed to remove him from the bench. No Supreme Court justice or president has ever been convicted by the Senate, although eight lower-level federal judges have been. The long odds didn't stop 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls from joining in on the effort. ""I sat through those hearings,"" Harris wrote on Twitter. ""Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached."" During the hearings, Harris  strongly implied  that she knew Kavanaugh had improperly discussed Special Counsel Robert Mueller's then-ongoing probe with a Trump-connected lawyer. Harris provided no evidence for the bombshell insinuation, which went viral on social media and  sent the hearing room into stunned silence , even as she directly accused Kavanaugh of lying under oath. Castro and Warren echoed that sentiment and said Kavanaugh had committed perjury. FLASHBACK: GRAHAM SAYS DEMS' KAVANAUGH SMEARS HAVE UNITED REPUBLICANS FLASHBACK: FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS KAVANAUGH FIGHT HAS REVITALIZED GOP BASE, INCREASED REPUBLICAN INTEREST IN ELECTION ""It’s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath,"" Castro wrote. ""He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter."" Warren  wrote:  ""Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."" O'Rourke claimed to ""know"" that Kavanaugh had lied under oath, and falsely said that the new accuser was not known to Senate Democrats or the FBI last year. ""Yesterday, we learned of another accusation against Brett Kavanaugh—one we didn't find out about before he was confirmed because the Senate forced the F.B.I. to rush its investigation to save his nomination,"" O'Rourke said. ""We know he lied under oath. He should be impeached."" Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.,  tweeted  in part, ""This new allegation and additional corroborating evidence adds to a long list of reasons why Brett Kavanaugh should not be a Supreme Court justice. I stand with survivors and countless other Americans in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin."" Amy Klobuchar stopped short of calling for impeachment, and instead posted a picture of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford with the words, ""Let us never forget what courage looks like."" DEM SENATOR CITES KAVANAUGH'S ALLEGED PRO-LIFE LEANINGS AS REASON TO DENY HIM A FAIR HEARING  Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, said he backed getting rid of Kavanaugh by any legal means available: ""The revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable."" As the calls mounted, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., shot back Sunday afternoon on  Twitter  -- and made clear that Kavanaugh wasn't going anywhere. ""The far left’s willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year’s confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate,"" McConnell wrote. He added: ""Fortunately a majority of Senators and the American people rallied behind timeless principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence. I look forward to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh."" The Times' piece also stated that well before Kavanaugh became a federal judge, ""at least seven people"" had heard about how he allegedly exposed himself to Deborah Ramirez at a party. Ramirez had called classmates at Yale seeking corroboration for her story, and even told some of her classmates that she could not remember the culprit in the alleged episode -- before changing her mind and publicly blaming Kavanaugh ""after six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney,""  the New Yorker reported last year  in a  widely derided  piece. The Senate Judiciary Committee, then led by Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote in an  executive summary of its investigation  that it contacted Ramirez’s counsel ""seven times seeking evidence to support claims made in the New Yorker,"" but that ""Ms. Ramirez produced nothing in response and refused a Committee request for an interview."" Late Sunday, Grassley's office called out the Times for omitting key details in the story published this weekend. "" @NYTimes  did not contact Sen. Grassley’s office for this story. If they had, we would've reminded them of a few key public facts they omitted,"" Grassley's team wrote. ""Despite 7 attempts by staff, Ms. Ramirez' lawyers declined to provide documentary evidence referenced in the article/witness accounts to support the claims. They also declined invitations for Ms. Ramirez to speak with committee investigators or to provide a written statement."" Additionally, the FBI separately reached out to nearly a dozen individuals to corroborate the allegations by Ford and Ramirez, and ultimately spoke to ten individuals and two eyewitnesses, but apparently found no corroboration. The agency's investigation began after then-Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., called for a one-week delay in Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings so an independent agency could look into the claims against him. Flake said the FBI's probe  needed to be limited in length  to avoid derailing the proceedings with endless claims and probes going back to Kavanaugh's high school years. Kavanaugh, predicted by Democrats during his confirmation process to be a hardline conservative, often sided with liberal justices during the Supreme Court's last term. The president, meanwhile, accused the media of trying to influence Kavanaugh. He also went on to say that Kavanaugh should go on the offensive and take on the media for false statements. ""Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can’t let that happen!"" he  tweeted. Grassley  sent several criminal referrals  to the Justice Department related to alleged lies submitted to Senate investigators during Kavanaugh's confirmation process -- which could be what the president meant when he wrote Sunday that the DOJ ""should come to [Kavanuagh's] rescue."" One of those referrals was for  now-disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti  and one of his clients, Julie Swetnick, regarding a potential ""conspiracy"" to provide false statements to Congress and obstruct its investigation.  Swetnick's credibility took a hit  as she changed her story about Kavanaugh's purported gang-rape trains, and her ex-boyfriend went public to say she was known for ""exaggerating everything."" Swetnick and Ramirez were just two of several women who had accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct during his confirmation process. Christine Blasey Ford notably testified that Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault her at a party when they were teens, and  dubiously asserted  that the memory was ""indelible"" in her ""hippocampus"" -- although no witnesses could corroborate her  ever-changing story  --  even her close lifelong friend, Leland Keyser , who Ford said had attended the party. Keyser, according to the Times reporters' new book,  did not believe Ford's story  -- and refused to change her mind, despite pressure from progressive activists and Ford's friends. ""It just didn't make any sense,"" Keyser said, referring to Ford's explanation of how she was assaulted at a party that Keyser attended, but could not recall how she got home. Ford's attorney,  Debra Katz , was quoted in a new book as saying that Ford was motivated to come forward in part by a desire to tag Kavanaugh's reputation with an ""asterisk"" before he could start ruling on abortion-related cases. ""In the aftermath of these hearings, I believe that Christine’s testimony brought about more good than the harm misogynist Republicans caused by allowing Kavanaugh on the court,"" Katz said. ""He will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important. ""It is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine."" The Federalist  reported last week  that Ford's father  privately supported Kavanaugh's confirmation , and approached Ed Kavanaugh on a golf course to make his support clear. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Some claims that surfaced during Kavanaugh's confirmation fell apart within days. For example, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., received a call from an anonymous constituent who claimed that in 1985, two ""heavily inebriated men"" referred to as ""Brett and Mark"" had sexually assaulted a friend of hers on a boat. The Twitter account belonging to the accuser apparently  advocated for a military coup  against the Trump administration. The constituent recanted the sexual assault claim on the social media site days later. Fox News' Andrew Craft in Plano, Texas, Chad Pergram, and Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report."
"Julian Castro questions Joe Biden's recall at the third Democratic debate in Houston; reaction from DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa.

"5. Who's going to win South Carolina?:  On Monday, several Democratic candidates will be in the Palmetto State for the Galivants Ferry Stump meeting, where the  candidates speak from literal stumps.   Which got me thinking about South Carolina and its role in this nomination fight. The vote is set for Saturday, February 29 (yes, 2020 is a leap year!) which puts it 26 days after the Iowa caucuses, 18 days after the New Hampshire primary and a week after the Nevada caucuses. The state is seen, at least at the moment, primarily as former Vice President Joe Biden's firewall in the event he can't win Iowa or New Hampshire in the earliest days of the race. Biden's strength in the state is heavily fueled by his popularity in the African-American community, which, if history is any guide, will comprise well more than half of all primary voters. But the state's large voting black population also makes it a very attractive potential target for California Sen. Kamala Harris, who is also black and has dedicated significant time and organizing efforts in the state. The question I have -- and the Biden people must have, too -- is whether or not black voters in South Carolina stick with the former VP all the way until February 29 if he doesn't win either of the first two major votes. What if Elizabeth Warren wins Iowa and New Hampshire and roars into South Carolina with all the momentum? Or if Harris wins Iowa or places a close second? Does that change the calculus of black voters in South Carolina? The state has yet to receive the full attention of the national media horde due to the fact that it votes almost a month after Iowa. But if past is prologue, South Carolina could be -- again -- the state that makes or breaks the presidential frontrunner. 4. Warren's big speech:  The rise of Elizabeth Warren in the 2020 campaign -- after a very rough start -- has been built less on major speeches than on her relentless energy in town halls and her policy shop's unending series of proposals to address everything from Electoral College reform to criminal justice reform. Heck, her campaign even sells  ""Warren has a plan for that"" T-shirts! Which is what makes Warren's planned speech on Monday in Washington Square Park in New York City all the more noteworthy. The address is touted as a speech on ""how corruption in Washington has allowed the rich and powerful to grow richer and more powerful,"" according to the  Facebook event page. Her campaign clearly sees this speech as a Major Moment in her campaign -- a chance to deliver a forceful condemnation of Wall Street and Washington in a way that reaches both her adoring base but also the wider Democratic Party. Inherent in Warren's bashing of the influence of corporate interests will be the fact that she has  refused any corporate or political action committee money  in this campaign, while her main rival for the nomination, Joe Biden, has been far less stringent in inspecting where donations come from. 3. Battleground New Mexico? : President Donald Trump  jets to New Mexico on Monday  for a campaign rally, the latest sign that his campaign thinks he can make the Land of Enchantment competitive in 2020. Trump visited New Mexico during the 2016 campaign but lost the state by  8 points  to Hillary Clinton. But George W. Bush won New Mexico -- albeit very narrowly -- in 2004, and the state has shown the occasional willingness to elect other Republicans like Susana Martinez, who spent eight years as governor. Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale has repeatedly suggested that Trump can win in New Mexico -- and in June,  said Trump would win in the state if the election were held that day . The pro-Trump argument is that Trump's push to de-regulate the oil and gas industries has led to an economic boom in major energy producing states like New Mexico. (The state's unemployment rate was 4.9% in July.) All that said, the state seems like a heavy lift for Trump. New Mexico is almost half (49%) Hispanic, and those voters have trended toward Democrats in recent years -- handing Democrats control over both Senate seats, all three House seats and the governor's mansion. But remember that Trump needs to find ways to expand the 2020 map -- particularly if Michigan, Wisconsin or Pennsylvania (all of which he won in 2016) revert back to their traditional Democratic voting patterns. 2. Biden will be the frontrunner for another month...:  Biden had his  best first hour of a debate  last week in Houston. While he faded down the stretch -- big time -- the storyline coming out of the debate was Biden's strong first hour and the very controversial move by Julián Castro to inject Biden's age and competency into the race. All of which means that Biden will likely keep the lead he has held in polling since he entered the race in the spring through, at least, the mid-October debates -- sponsored by CNN and in Ohio. (To date, debate performance has been the one thing that has moved candidates' numbers in any meaningful way.) And the longer Biden stays on top, the more the idea seeps into the Democratic consciousness that he will wind up as the nominee -- even if has to endure a few ups and downs along the way. And all of that works in Biden's favor because his case to Democratic voters is built on two things: Inevitability and electability. And one feeds off the other. The longer Biden stays ahead in Democratic primary polling, the more people in and out of the party see him as the nominee. The more he is seen as the nominee, the more meaningful general election polling that shows Biden beating Trump is -- up  15 points in a WaPo-ABC poll  this week -- and the easier it is for Biden to make the electability argument. 1. ...But the slings and arrows are going to start really flying : Sure, Biden wound up benefiting from Castro's attack in this debate. But what Castro did is likely to create a sort of open season on the former vice president -- especially given, per No 2 above, he continues to be the clear frontrunner and the Iowa caucuses keep getting closer and closer. Notice, amid all of the generally negative post-debate coverage about Castro's attack on Biden, there was  this  from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (D): ""I think that we are at a tough point right now because there are a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden's ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling."" While Booker's line got overlooked amid the crush of attention on Biden-Castro, it might have been the most consequential thing that happened as it relates to where Biden's opponents are going. Remember that the  is-Biden-ready-for-primetime questions  began with Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. Then they moved to Castro. Then to Booker. What's the pattern? The is-he-up-to-this conversation is moving closer and closer to center stage, being picked up by candidates who are more serious threats to Biden's nomination. Which begs the question: When do Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders  go there  on Biden?"
"Addressing   thousands of supporters in Washington Square Park, the Massachusetts Democrat connected the mix of populist rage and insider activist politicking that followed the deadly blaze at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory -- and led to the passage of a raft of new labor laws -- to her broader vision for eradicating corruption in Washington. Warren told the story through the lens of  Frances Perkins, who led the charge for change in New York before going on to become President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's labor secretary -- the first woman to hold a Cabinet position -- and an author of the New Deal. Perkins ""used the same model that she and her friends had used after the Triangle Fire: She worked the political system relentlessly from the inside, while a sustained movement applied pressure from the outside,"" Warren said Monday night. ""As Frances Perkins put it, the Triangle fire was 'the day the New Deal was born.' "" Warren's push to combat public corruption by implementing stricter ethics laws has been the central theme of her presidential campaign. Underlying that argument has been a promise to work an inside-outside model of politics, connecting progressive activists with like-minded lawmakers. Her message got a boost ahead of the speech with introductions from Democratic New York state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi and Working Families Party national director Maurice Mitchell, whose  group had endorsed Warren  earlier in the day. In a rare round of prepared remarks, Warren channeled the women-led organizing that followed the Triangle Shirtwaist fire -- a story, she said, ""about power,"" its abuses and organized opposition -- to make a modern case for undertaking radical anti-corruption measures in Washington. ""Climate change. Gun safety. Health care. On the face of it, these three are totally different issues. But despite our being the strongest and wealthiest country in the history of the world, our democracy is paralyzed,"" Warren said. ""And why? Because giant corporations have bought off our government."" The measures  she unveiled earlier Monday, Warren argued, would go a long way in breaking that grip. She proposed banning federal lawmakers and their senior staff from serving on corporate boards and requiring every new member of Congress to make public any potential financial conflicts before they take office. Corporate lobbyists would have to wait six years before becoming eligible for government jobs, and a range of other powerful officials -- from the president to federal judges and Cabinet secretaries -- would be permanently disqualified from working as lobbyists after leaving office. Warren's remarks in New York were the first she's delivered off a teleprompter since her campaign kickoff in Lawrence, Massachusetts, earlier this year. They also picked up a similar theme: an urgent call to action using the story of activism driven by women, in that case the ""Bread and Roses"" textile workers' strike of 1912. ""We're not here today because of famous arches or famous men. In fact, we're not here because of men at all,"" Warren said Monday. ""We're here because of some hardworking women,"" she added, before telling, in vivid detail, the story of the Triangle Shirtwaist disaster. This latest round of proposals builds on an already extensive set of suggested overhauls to how the government regulates big corporations and itself. In both the new rollout and her speech, Warren argues that without tightening anti-corruption laws and tying down big money interests, the policies favored by most progressives are doomed to defeat in Washington. To untie that knot, she would impose a slate of new rules designed to ""end lobbying as we know it"" by creating a broader definition of the kinds of activities that would fall under the title. And in a specific reference to the work done by 2016 Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, Warren proposes banning private lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.   Her plan calls for limiting lobbyists' influence on domestic elections by forbidding them from making political contributions, acting as ""bundlers"" -- or helping to pool other people's donations -- and hosting fundraisers for candidates. The industry more generally would also be governed by new regulations on the amount it can spend to influence elected officials, and be forced to pay a tax on annual expenditures over $500,000. ""Allowing individuals who are paid to influence government officials on policy to also give gifts or funnel money to the political campaigns of those same officials sounds like legalized bribery,"" Warren wrote in a Medium post. On the government side, she wants to establish a federal ""Office of the Public Advocate,"" which she said in her post would engage the public in a more substantial way when regulatory rules are being negotiated or become subject to change.  Additionally, Warren is pushing for new mechanisms to enforce ethics rules -- and punish violations -- by creating what she's calling the ""US Office of Public Integrity,"" which would be empowered to investigate potential ethical breaches by government officials.  In her Medium post, she connected the need for more robust enforcement back to the Trump White House's habit of ignoring watchdog warnings and recommendations. ""When Secretary Ben Carson was warned about his son participating in fancy government events, he brushed it off,"" Warren writes. ""And when an independent federal ethics watchdog determined that Kellyanne Conway should be fired for repeatedly violating federal law, the administration barely cared."" In her speech, Warren described their boss, President Donald Trump, as ""corruption in the flesh."" In her post, she also took aim at another Trump: retired federal appellate Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, whose departure from the bench ended an investigation into whether she had broken judicial conduct rules by committing tax fraud.   ""Under my plan,"" Warren wrote, ""investigations will remain open until their findings are made public and any penalties for misconduct are issued."" This latest Warren plan, one of her most in-depth to date, would also seek to change the definition of what constitutes an ""official act"" when it comes to law enforcement dealings with potential or suspected pay-to-play schemes.  Warren called the Supreme Court ruling in McDonnell v. United States -- which overturned the conviction of Republican former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell on corruption charges -- ""wrong-headed,"" and pledged to seek legislation sharpening the rules. The precedent set by the decision has made it more difficult for prosecutors to prove similar allegations in court. Warren's proposal would again seek to impose a more comprehensive standard for what could be considered bribery of elected officials -- and eliminate what she calls a ""tractor-sized loophole"" in the law. The result, she wrote, would be to ensure ""that corrupt politicians who accept bribes can be prosecuted. It also clarifies that a stream of benefits -- rather than a single act -- qualifies as an unlawful benefit paid in exchange for a bribe."""
"After all, it's that the world Trump has occupied for the better part of four decades. It's there he gained his celebrity, molded his reputation and earned enough of a following to make a presidential bid possible. Now, the man who has consumed Trump's attention for much of his tenure is invading his turf. Former President Barack Obama, along with wife Michelle, are producing partners with Netflix. Their  first feature, a documentary about a Chinese-owned factory in Ohio , was announced last month. The news apparently hasn't pleased Trump. In a set of tweets on Monday, the President urged congressional investigators to ""Look at the Obama Book Deal, or the ridiculous Netflix deal"" instead of looking at whether he committed obstruction of justice during Robert Mueller's probe.  Later, Trump simplified things: ""Obama Netflix?"" he wrote, after insisting without evidence he was due to lose billions of dollars as president. In neither of his tweets did Trump specify what wrongdoing might have occurred in Obama's arrangement with Netflix nor his memoir deal with Random House, which was announced in 2017. Obama's office declined to comment. But the fresh criticism amounts to the latest evidence of Trump's lingering fixation on Obama, who he's met in person only once since Inauguration Day. He's accused him of spying on his Trump Tower campaign office. He blames him for a host of foreign policy debacles, from the Middle East to North Korea. And he's claimed his trade policies put America on its heels. That's not to mention the ""birther"" conspiracy Trump fueled years before vying for the presidency himself, a racist lie he propagated using regular appearances on Fox News and other television programs. His indignation only deepened when Obama made fun of him during a 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner speech and television cameras found Trump scowling in the audience. At the same time, Trump has sought to dismantle some of Obama's chief accomplishments, including on environmental protections and health care. He boasted on Twitter Monday about outpacing Obama's judicial appointments -- an effort mainly fueled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has pushed Trump's nominees through in the absence of major legislation. Home turf for Trump In going after Obama's post-presidency business arrangements with Netflix and Random House, Trump is delving into two arenas -- television deals and book publishing -- he knows well. His book ""Art of the Deal"" and NBC reality series ""The Apprentice"" were critical in creating the exaggerated image of a billionaire businessman that helped propel him to the White House. He remains an avid television consumer, watching hours of cable news a day, though isn't known to read much. ""He in very many ways used television to become president, but then TV kind of became the president, because what he was seeing on TV set his agenda and controlled his mood and determined the world that the rest of us would live in,"" New York Times chief television critic James Poniewozik -- whose book ""Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television and the Fracturing of America"" came out last week -- told CNN's Brian Stelter on the ""Reliable Sources"" podcast. Trump's tweets on Monday targeted deals widely reported to be netting the Obamas tens of millions of dollars. Neither company publicly disclosed the terms of their contracts, but publishing sources placed the book advance north of $60 million for memoirs from both the former President and first lady. Michelle Obama's book, ""Becoming,"" was the best-selling book of 2018 and one of the most popular political memoirs ever. The former president, meanwhile, has been writing his by hand, and it's not expected to be released until at least next year. The Netflix production deal, announced more than a year ago, led to the formation of ""Higher Ground Productions,"" which will create a broad range of programming for the streaming service. The first slate included the factory documentary, a drama series about women and people of color in post-World War II New York, and a Frederick Douglas biopic adapted from a Pulitzer-prize winning biography. Tradition holds? The Obamas aren't expected to produce programming that is overly political -- a continuation of their preference to largely avoid direct criticism of the current president. That's a pattern other ex-presidents have followed after leaving office. Usually it's reciprocated to an extent by the sitting president, though past leaders -- including Obama -- have blamed some of their predicaments of the men who came before them. None, however, have gone at it with the same gusto as Trump. The President has only escalated his attacks as Obama's vice president, Joe Biden, vies for the Democratic presidential nomination. He's accused the duo of agreeing to a ""disaster"" Iran nuclear deal that allowed ""pallets of cash"" to be shipped to Tehran, though recently Trump has expressed his own openness to extending the Iranians a line of credit during negotiations. In talks with North Korea, Trump has lamented the nuclear situation there wasn't handled during previous administrations. He claimed Obama sought his own meeting with Kim Jong Un, the dictator with whom Trump has developed a friendship (Obama's aides deny there were any overtures to Kim). The only time the men met for substantive talks was at the White House shortly after the 2016 election. Then, Obama warned Trump that North Korea could prove to be his most intractable problem. But Trump has enhanced that warning to claim Obama advised him he'd be at war with the country before long. Since that meeting in the Oval Office, the two men have barely spoken. They met in person only once, during the state funeral for President George H.W. Bush, exchanging businesslike handshakes in the front pews of the National Cathedral before the service began."
"Fox News contributor Richard Fowler and Nevada Republican congressional candidate Lisa Song Sutton debate the importance of economic growth under President Trump to the 2020 election cycle. The United Auto Workers union  went on strike  Monday morning against General Motors. Iran has reportedly attacked Saudi oil facilities. Both these events will generate more alarmist headlines, foretelling soaring oil prices or collapsing auto sales, and pointing to a looming recession. According to a recent tally, the word “recession” has occurred in more headlines over the past month than at any time since the financial crisis. Democrats and their allies in the liberal media are so hoping for a downturn. The last thing they want to campaign against in 2020 is full employment and rising incomes. Consider last week’s Democratic debate, during which 10 leading candidates avoided all mention of the  economy . It was a formidable performance, ignoring for three hours what has always been, and will always be, the top concern for voters. It was not an accident. The Democratic  presidential  candidates who gathered for the debate in Houston know that Americans are feeling upbeat about their own prospects and, despite the very best efforts of a compliant media, are optimistic about the future. Selling voters on policies that would torpedo the country’s growth, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposal to overturn our capitalist system or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' ""Medicare-for-all"" or New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker’s Green New Deal, is an uphill battle. 2020 HOPEFUL JOHN DELANEY SLAMS TRUMP ON TRADE: 'EVERY ACRE OF GROUND IN IOWA IS WORTH LESS TODAY' With unemployment low and jobs plentiful, incomes rising, and racial gaps narrowing, Democrats have a steep hill to climb even before they get to more contentious issues like abortion without limits or open borders. The best Democrats can hope for is that the economy falls off a cliff between now and 2020. The liberal media has obligingly promoted dozens of reasons why this could happen at any moment. Interest rates are inverted! Interest rates are too low! Interest rates are too high! The Fed is not responsive; the Fed is too responsive! Trump’s tariffs are killing consumers, the farmers, manufacturers, or somebody? CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Surely, there is a recession looming somewhere. But, as it happens, not yet. Consider last week’s news. Retail sales in August rose 0.4 percent, double experts’ forecasts. Likewise, the University of Michigan reported that consumer sentiment bounced higher, beating estimates. If you think that such reports frequently come in above forecasts, you’re right. A spike up in Citi’s Economic Surprise, which measures real reports against expectations, suggests that reports from the media and from Wall Street have consistently been overly pessimistic. Consider the alarm bells rung in recent weeks about the inversion of the yield curve, with short rates moving above those on longer-term bonds. Headlines blared that the shift guaranteed a recession was coming, if not already underway. But, as markets eventually realigned, and the flow of positive surprises continued, analysts came to conclude that this traditional precursor to a recession may no longer be reliable. The impact of the Federal Reserve and other central banks on interest rates is not only profound, it is also opaque. With a $4 trillion balance sheet, how the Fed buys and sells securities in its portfolio is unquestionably influential, and may have caused the rate inversion.  No matter. The harbingers of doom skipped seamlessly from inversion to the danger from rising mortgage rates, which increased along with a general recovery of long rates. “Mortgage rates had worst week in 3 years” blared one headline on CNBC, adding “it may be only the beginning.” After breathlessly reporting that the rate on a 30-year mortgage had climbed 36 basis points (about a third of 1 percent) in the past couple of weeks, described as “bad news for borrowers,” the author had to concede that, “The good news is that rates are still incredibly low, and in the weeks before this turnaround, rates had fallen to the lowest level in three years.” In fact, Matthew Graham, chief operating officer of Mortgage News Daily is quoted saying, “August was the best month for mortgage rates, and 2019 has been the best year since 2011. And that’s precisely why this terrible week is possible: It’s largely a technical correction to the feverish strength in August.” Forgetting the silly headlines, the author inadvertently raises yet another reason to be bullish. If the economy is a four-cylinder engine, we are currently running on only two – consumer (the largest) and government spending. Business investment has dropped, in response to uncertainty about the trade battle with China. Also, the large housing sector has been largely AWOL throughout this recovery. Before the financial crisis, real estate construction amounted to nearly 9 percent of GDP; last year it was barely above 6 percent. There are a number of reasons for the surprising drought of new building, including an initial glut of inventory produced by the housing bubble. Young buyers face constraints such as high levels of student debt. At the same time, millennials have largely chosen to be city-dwellers; the high cost of rents has made it difficult for many to accumulate the funds needed to make a down payment on a home. My theory is that, beyond those contributing factors, the country is less confident that home ownership is the first infallible step to wealth creation. Buying a home is attractive for many reasons, especially as rents climb in urban areas, but buyers are more cautious than they were before. They know that people can lose money on their homes, a sour aftertaste of the financial crisis. Nevertheless, with mortgage rates extremely low, a shortage of houses on the market and with household formations growing, we will almost surely have a boom in home construction in the foreseeable future. Housing starts peaked in the last cycle at better than 2 million; last year they totaled 1.2 million. That number will likely increase, spurring further growth.

"""Hate is on the rise again, and we're at a defining moment again in American history,"" said Biden, who served as vice president to the United States' first black President Barack Obama. ""Hate only hides. It doesn't go away. If you give it oxygen it comes out from under the rocks."" Biden tied the forces that motivated the 1963 church bombing that claimed the lives of four young girls to those driving the massacres in  El Paso, Texas ; Charleston, South Carolina; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Poway, California. ""The same poisonous ideology that lit the fuse at 16th Street pulled the trigger at Mother Emanuel, pastor you have such an incredible congregation....pulled the trigger at Mother Emanuel and unleashed the anti-Semitism, anti-Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh and Poway,"" Biden said. ""We saw a white supremacist gun down innocent Latino immigrants in an El Paso parking lot with a  military-style weapon declaring it would stop quote the 'Hispanic invasion of Texas.' We have not relegated racism and white supremacy to the pages of history."" Biden, who addressed a predominantly black congregation Sunday, has -- at times --  stumbled while discussing race  during his 2020 presidential campaign.  Biden has faced criticism for  misspeaking on issues of race , and Democratic challengers --  including California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker  -- have repeatedly challenged the statesman's record on busing and comments on working with  segregationist senators . Earlier Sunday, fellow Democratic hopeful Pete Buttigieg told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" that Biden gave  a ""bad answer"" on the legacy of slavery  during the  third Democratic presidential debate  in Houston Thursday. Still, Biden remains the frontrunner in the Democratic presidential primary. His lead, according to a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS,  rests on his support among black voters , among whom he leads by a wide margin with 42% backing him and his nearest competitor -- Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- earning just 12% support.  Biden on Sunday   recounted the church bombing and the impact it had on the nation. ""The assassination of four bright promising innocent young girls preparing for Sunday school, the indiscriminate cruelty of a stick of dynamite. The appalling impunity afforded the murderers while a grieving community cried out for justice and the nation watched. It pierced us,"" Biden said. ""Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole, Denise --- their murders laid bare the lie that a child could be free in America while oppression's long shadow darkened our cities and ruled our country side."" Biden gets emotional In an emotional moment, Biden talked about the experience of losing a young child, later recounting the deaths of his wife and daughter in a car accident and his son Beau's passing from cancer. ""When you lose a child so young as many of us have experienced in different circumstances, the loss is always punctuated by questions no matter how much time passes. What would she look like, what would she become? What would she have done? What memories will never be?"" he said. Biden refrained from outright mentioning President Donald Trump or the 2020 presidential election, but laid out what he thinks is at stake in the nation. ""We're in the battle for the soul of America. And here at historic 16th street Baptist church there's no more powerful reminder of what's at stake, no more poignant example of what is demanded of us in response,"" he said ""It's a battle we fought again and again, it's a battle that's claimed countless lives.""   Biden also talked about the progress that has been made since the church bombing and hopes that more change will come. ""I'm sure, in the first hours after the bomb exploded -- it was hard to see through the smoke and rubble of this church and our hearts, hard to see through the smoke and rubble to a day like today. As Dr. King eulogized those girls, perhaps not even he could have imagined that a day nearly 50 years later when the nation's first black president would award the Congressional Gold Medal -- one of our highest civilian honors -- to those young women. It's only with persistent effort. It's only with fortitude. It's only with faith in ourselves and the future that may yet to be that can change things, that change comes -- sometimes slowly, sometimes all at once -- and but it continues."" ""We know we're not there yet, and no one knows it better. My mom used to have an expression -- 'you want to understand me. walk in my shoes a mile.'"" Biden said. ""Those of us who are white try, but we can never fully fully understand, no matter how hard we try.""  Biden concluded his speech at the service, saying. ""My prayer to all of us this morning is that in this moment when our nation must again once decide again who we are, what we stand for, we will remember the strength of this community, remember the moment that time stopped and then remember everything that came after and will choose once more to fight for our shared American dream."" After the service, Biden walked outside of the church along 16th Street with Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, behind a man carrying a wreath. They stopped at a plaque on the ground memorializing the four girls who died in the church bombing and prayed. This story has been updated."
"All five of these things are simultaneously true: Joe Biden is the Democratic front-runner and may well be the nominee. He is by far the favorite candidate among black voters. He was a loyal vice president to Barack Obama, and the two men seem to have shared a deep and true friendship. He, like the other Democratic candidates, would be a vast improvement over Donald Trump. And, Biden’s positioning on racial issues has been problematic. This issue exposed itself again Thursday during the presidential debate in Houston.  Moderator Linsey Davis put a question to Biden : “Mr. Vice President, I want to come to you and talk to you about inequality in schools and race. In a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975, you told a reporter, ‘I don’t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather, I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I’ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.’ You said that some 40 years ago. But as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?” Biden could have taken responsibility for his comments and addressed the question directly, but he didn’t. Instead, he gave a rambling, nonsensical answer that included a reference to a record player. But, the response ended in yet another racial offense in which he seemed to suggest that black people lack the natural capacity to be good parents: We bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It’s not that they don’t want to help. They don’t — they don’t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television — excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the — the — make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school — a very poor background will hear four million words fewer spoken by the time they get there. His language reveals a particular mind-set, one of a liberal of a particular vintage. On the issue of race, it is paternalistic and it pities, it sees deficiency in much the same way that the conservative does, but it responds as savior rather than with savagery. Better the former than the latter, surely, but the sensibility underlying the two positions is shockingly similar. It underscores that liberalism does not perfectly align with racial egalitarianism, regardless of rhetoric to the contrary. On Sunday,  Biden made a speech  on race in Birmingham commemorating the 1963 bombing at the 16th Street Baptist Church, in which he said on the issue of how racism and racial hatred affect black people: “We know we’re not there yet. No one knows it better. My mom used to have an expression, ‘You want to understand me, walk in my shoes a mile.’ Those of us who are white try, but we can never fully, fully understand. No matter how hard we try. We’re almost, we’re almost at this next phase of progress in my view.” Progress. That is the wall behind which white America hides, including white liberals. (Even many black leaders have absorbed and regurgitate the progress narrative.) It expects black people to swell and applaud at their effort. But, how is that a fair and legitimate expectation? Slavery, white supremacy and racism, are horrid, man-made constructs that should never have existed in the first place. Am I supposed to cheer the slow, creeping, centuries-long undoing of a thing that should never have been done? Malcolm X was once asked if he felt that we were making progress in the country. He responded: “No. I will never say that progress is being made. If you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches, there’s no progress. If you pull it all the way out, that’s not progress. The progress is healing the wound that the blow made.” I don’t even think that’s progress. That just returns the situation to a common baseline before the crime was committed. Furthermore, it’s not what Biden says in prepared remarks that’s problematic, it’s what he says off the cuff and under pressure that to me reveal an antiquated view on racial matters and racial sensitivities. It was the way he advocated for the 1994 crime bill, a bill that contributed to America’s surging mass incarceration, which disproportionately affected black and brown people in this country. The bill did some good, but the harm it did cannot be overlooked or understated. Rather than fully owning up to to the disastrous aspects of the bill, Biden has over the years bragged about it and defended it. It was in the way he described then-candidate Barack Obama in 2007 as an African-American who was “articulate and bright and clean.” Clean? As opposed to what? This critique of Biden isn’t personal. I bear no ill will for the man. But, a fact is a fact, and no amount of growth, change or well-intentioned good-heartedness has the ability to erase it.

"Democratic 2020 candidates slam President Trump as a racist at presidential debate in Houston; reaction from Fox News contributor Deroy Murdock, syndicated columnist and contributing editor for National Review Online. “ Donald Trump  is a racist.” Democrats deploy this lie more often than commas and periods. Look no further than Thursday’s Democratic  presidential  debate in Houston. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey declared: “We know Donald Trump’s a racist, but there is no red badge of courage for calling him that.” He claimed that America has “a president that [sic] can’t condemn white supremacy.” MARK LEVIN RIPS 2020 DEM FIELD AS 'WEAKEST CANDIDATES I'VE EVER SEEN': 'SO IMMATURE -- ALL OF THEM' “Anyone who supports this [President Trump’s immigration policies] is supporting racism,” said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. “The only people, though, who actually buy into this president’s hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who don’t know any.” Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas shouted: “We have a white supremacist in the White House, and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country.” “President Trump, you’ve spent the last two-and-a-half years full-time trying to sow hate and division among us,” Sen. Kamala Harris of California hectored, “and that is why we’ve gotten nothing done.” These and other Democrats deliberately ignore the 25 or more instances in which Trump condemned racism, denounced white nationalism, attacked anti-Semitism, applauded Jews, embraced blacks, praised Muslims, and preached national unity and love among Americans, from coast to coast. I repeatedly have documented these statements, events, and actions in tremendous detail, most recently in a piece in the  National Review. Just last Tuesday, Trump addressed the 2019 National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week Conference at Washington’s Renaissance Hotel. The president did not merely breeze by for a photo op. He spent a full 30 minutes speaking with black educators and detailing his policies to assist scholars, professors and administrators at these 101 public and private campuses – most with large, if not majority, black student bodies. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER “For more than 180 years, HBCUs have strengthened our country and called America to greatness,” Trump said. “Your institutions have been pillars of excellence in higher education and the engines of advancement for African-American citizens.” Trump celebrated distinguished HBCU alumni, including such noted Americans as educator Booker T. Washington, the Tuskegee Airmen who helped win World War II, civil rights leaders Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr., Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and others. Trump specified the steps that he and his administration have taken to advance HBCUs, including the following: Many HBCU students attend summer school. HBCU presidents appealed to President Barack Obama for eight years to allow year-round Pell Grants for college students. Obama didn’t lift a finger. Trump approved this in less than two years and gave HBCU students fresh financial aid options. Trump added: “I signed legislation to increase federal funding for HBCUs by a record 13 percent.” (Fiscal hawks might bristle at that number, but no one can call such a spending hike bigoted.) The Trump administration forgave the debts of Dillard, Xavier and other New Orleans-area HBCUs, which have struggled since the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. The White House has pressed NASA to recruit HBCU students interested in space careers. The Departments of Labor and Education are collaborating with HBCUs to expand apprenticeships for their students. Forty students have been chosen as the 2019 White House HBCU Competitiveness Scholars. In his fifth week in office, Trump explained: “I signed an executive order to move the federal HBCU initiative to the White House, right where it belongs.” These and other Democrats deliberately ignore the 25 or more instances in which Trump condemned racism, denounced white nationalism, attacked anti-Semitism, applauded Jews, embraced blacks, praised Muslims, and preached national unity and love among Americans, from coast to coast. These and other pro-HBCU reforms unfold just steps away from the Oval Office, not in some far-flung federal outpost. Beyond this, Trump repeatedly spoke about national unity, including when he said: “Every day of my presidency, we’ll strive to give every child, of every background and every race, religion and creed, the best chance to reach that beautiful American Dream.” These are the words of a racist? Naturally, this huge story generated tremendous attention among the Old Guard media. Wrong! Trump’s half-hour address garnered exactly zero minutes and zero seconds of coverage on that night’s ABC, CBS and NBC evening news programs. Alas, Trump stomped on his own potential HBCU headlines by firing National Security Adviser John Bolton via Twitter at 11:58 a.m., just two-and-a-half hours before his speech. Still, despite that major development, ABC, CBS and NBC could have spared a moment or two to mention Trump’s HBCU presentation, at least fleetingly. After all, the networks somehow found time for such urgent developments as ABC’s 15 seconds on the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders doubling their pay, CBS’ 22 seconds on the health benefits of twice-weekly naps, and NBC’s one minute and 34 seconds on a 9-year-old Ohio boy who was “lunch-shamed” on his birthday. “The national news media have no interest in highlighting any facts which might undermine the ‘Trump is a racist’ narrative,” the Media Research Center’s Brent Baker observed. MRC kindly furnished this statistical confirmation of the networks’ irresponsible public affairs coverage. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Tuesday afternoon, Trump reached out to blacks – as he has many times before. On cue, the media buried the story. And, playing their part perfectly, top Democrats two days later screamed: “RACIST!” This is exactly why America is choking on the poison of division.

"Political analyst Ron Meyer and Democratic strategist Jason Nichols react to the Democratic debate. Former Vice President Joe Biden  and  Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , have kept up their debate over health care following their spat during Thursday night's Democratic debate, with Biden accusing Sanders of effectively handing Americans a pay cut and Sanders accusing Biden of distorting the socialist's ""Medicare-for-all"" plan. ""I do not doubt the motives of either of the two leaders on the issue of Medicare-for-all. I don't doubt their motives,"" Biden said in Houston Friday while discussing Sanders and  Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , ""but it’s going to cost over $3.4 trillion dollars a year just to fund Medicare. $3.4 trillion a year. ""That is twice the entire federal budget save interest on the debt. And so how do you do that without raising taxes? There's not enough taxes to cut -- eliminate tax breaks for the wealthy -- there's not enough out there to get you there,"" he added. Biden, the frontrunner, has faced criticism from multiple candidates for wanting to build on the Affordable Care Act rather than advocating a larger, single-payer program like  Medicare-for-all. BIDEN MOCKS SANDERS: 'FOR A SOCIALIST, YOU'VE GOT A LOT MORE CONFIDENCE IN CORPORATE AMERICA THAN I DO' On Friday, the Sanders campaign accused Biden of ""dishonest attacks"" and furthering the health care industry's narrative on the issue. “It's disappointing Joe Biden is echoing the deceptions and falsehoods of the health care industry ... Joe Biden may love the insurance industry and the outrageously high premiums, co-payments and out-of-pocket expenses they charge us. Most Americans don’t,"" a campaign statement read. During a campaign stop in Nevada Friday, Sanders repeated his refrain that health care is a human right and that Medicare-for-all would cover every man, woman and child in the country. It requires no premiums, no deductibles and no out-of-pocket costs and would expand Medicare to include such things as dental care, hearing aids and home health care."" “Apparently the vice president thinks it is just wonderful for people to be paying $1,000 a month ... just for health care premiums,"" he said during the town hall event in Carson City. ""Having deductibles of $4,000 or $5,000 or more — not a problem. Paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs — not a problem. Well, I think those are problems."" ""It's not a terribly radical idea because in one form or another it exists in countries all over the world, including Canada,"" Sanders said. ""Is it free? No. It is funded out of the general fund in a progressive manner."" Later in the event, Sanders listened as a 58-year-old Navy veteran with Huntington's disease told the senator he was planning to kill himself after losing his health care and racking up $139,000 in medical expenses. SANDERS LAUGHS OUT LOUD AT BIDEN'S 'RATHER HUMOROUS' CLAIM HE'S TOO TRUSTING OF 'CORPORATE AMERICA' Sanders responded, ""No, you're not,"" and promised to meet with the man privately after the event, according to the  Las Vegas Journal-Review. The scrap between Biden and Sanders is a microcosm of a broader, ongoing debate within the  Democratic Party . Sanders, a self-described  Democratic socialist , has championed progressive proposals and adopted a more aggressive, anti-corporate tone than Biden has. When the two faced off on Thursday, Biden attempted to mock Sanders' anti-corporate image by accusing him of trusting employers too much in his ""Medicare for all"" proposal. Biden argued that employers who now pay a share of workers’ premiums would pocket that money instead of giving workers raises if the government were to cover all health care costs. “Let me tell you something, for a socialist, you’ve got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do,"" Biden said. Sanders later laughed that statement off during an interview with Fox News following the debate. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""One of us voted for the Wall Street bailout -- that was Biden, by the way. One of us voted for disastrous trade agreements that were sponsored by corporate America -- that was Biden. One of us voted for a bankruptcy bill that was pushed by the banks -- that was Biden,"" he said. ""So, to suggest that Bernie Sanders is sympathetic to the corporate elite, I think, is rather humorous."" Fox News' Madeleine Rivera, Brooke Singman, Charles Creitz, and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"HBO host Bill Maher tells 'Real Time' audience that he hopes Koch's end was painful; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' ""Real Time"" host  Bill Maher  said Friday that Democrats could be heading toward a contested 2020 convention and suggested that Sen.  Amy Klobuchar , D-Minn., could emerge as a strong ""compromise candidate."" ""Can I present a scenario?"" Maher asked his guests during the show's panel segment. ""I think this might be one of those years where ... they can't get over that 'centrist' versus 'socialist' thing. So  Elizabeth Warren  at some point takes Bernie's voters, he drops out. It's Warren and Biden. And they go into the convention and it's deadlock. This has happened before in American politics and they need a compromise candidate."" He then pointed to Klobuchar as a viable option for Democrats in the general election against  President Trump . MAHER MOCKS MSNBC'S 'NEVER TRUMPERS': THEY'RE 'VERY FAR LEFT' BECAUSE 'LOOK AT WHO'S GIVING THEM THEIR PAYCHECK' ""I'm looking hard at Amy Klobuchar,"" Maher said. ""You know why? Because -- this is not an insult to Amy Klobuchar -- I like you, but they put generic Democrat on the ballot, they win."" Plus, he added, ""She's a woman. That moves a lot with the wokesters."" Guest Krystal Ball of The Hill rejected Maher's argument, insisting a ""centrist"" would lead to another defeat for Democrats. She insisted that Sen.  Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., would beat Trump. Maher pushed back, saying, ""Even the centrists in the Democratic Party are pretty far left."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, Democratic strategist Fernand Amandi told Maher that a centrist is the wrong ""C-word"" and that it's actually ""charisma"" that matters most -- and stressed the Democratic candidate should have plenty of it. ""Well, we're f---ed then,"" Maher replied."

WARREN BESTS BERNIE FOR KEY LEFT-WING ENDORSEMENT  NYT :  “The Working Families Party, the labor-aligned progressive group whose electoral influence has grown since the 2016 election, has endorsed Senator  Elizabeth Warren  of Massachusetts for the Democratic presidential nomination, a boon to her candidacy as she attempts to position herself as the main challenger to former Vice President  Joseph R. Biden  Jr. The party endorsed Senator  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont during the last presidential cycle, at which time he described Working Families as ‘the closest thing’ to ‘my vision of democratic socialism.’ The group’s endorsement of Ms. Warren on Monday, one of the few by a prominent progressive organization this early in the primary, could turn heads among left-leaning Democrats desperate to defeat Mr. Biden, the more moderate front-runner, in a primary election where their party’s ideological future is at stake.” Bernie shakes up New Hampshire staff -   Fox News:  “Facing discontent and unheeded warnings from longtime supporters that he could lose the New Hampshire primary, Sen.  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont on Sunday replaced the director of his presidential campaign operations in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House. The campaign broke the news on Sunday to more than 40 members of Sanders’ steering committee. The campaign announced that  Joe Caiazzo  was being replaced as state director.  Shannon Jackson , who made the announcement, will replace him. Jackson ran Sanders’ 2018 Senate re-election campaign and was a senior adviser on the independent senator’s 2016 White House bid as well as the current campaign. … The move comes as some Sanders supporters in New Hampshire are looking over their shoulders at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - the other progressive standard bearer in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential candidates.” Team Biden warns: Warren can’t connect with blue collar voters -   Politico:  “As Elizabeth Warren climbs in the polls, Joe Biden’s Massachusetts allies are warning that her election history suggests she runs weakest among the types of voters Democrats need to win over to capture the White House. While Warren won reelection easily in 2018, Biden’s backers point to her performance among independent and blue-collar voters as evidence she’ll fail to appeal to similar voters in the Rust Belt – just as  Hillary Clinton  did in 2016. ‘The grave concern of many of us Democrats in Massachusetts is that in many of the counties where Sen. Warren underperforms, they are demographically and culturally similar to voters in key swing states,’ said state Rep.  John Rogers , who backs Biden. …  Warren’s critics have long assailed the former Harvard Law School professor for being too far liberal and too out-of-touch with blue-collar voters to beat  Donald Trump , despite an economic message that speaks directly to many of their concerns.” Beto comes after Buttigieg over his conciliatory tone on guns -  Fox News:  “ Beto O’Rourke  launched an expletive-fueled defense of his call Sunday to ban assault-style weapons and impose mandatory buybacks of AR-15s and AK-47s while also pushing back at critics – including fellow 2020 Democrat  Pete Buttigieg . During last Thursday’s presidential debate, the former Texas congressman said, ‘Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47…’ Buttigieg [said] the clip … ‘will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns.’  … O’Rourke pushed back in a tweet: …. ‘When candidates say, ‘At least Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are pretending to be interested,' sh--, that is not enough. Neither is poll-testing your message. Gun violence is a life or death issue—and we have to represent the bold ideas of people all over the country.’” Old school South Carolina politics get a boost -  NYT:  [Today] organizers of the 2019 Galivants Ferry Stump will add new twists to what has become a 143-year tradition. For the first time, the stump meeting will host presidential candidates — and it will do so in the fall of an odd-numbered year. … But with interest in the Democratic primary so high in South Carolina, an early voting state, and no stump event planned until long after the state’s primary voters go to the polls, organizers said they had felt compelled to break from tradition and invite presidential contenders to Galivants Ferry in the fall. As of late Sunday, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Mayor  Bill de Blasio  of New York; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.; and Senator  Amy Klobuchar  of Minnesota were scheduled to attend. THE RULEBOOK: PRODUCTIVE, BUT NOT IN A GOOD WAY  “The public debt of the Union would be a further cause of collision between the separate States or confederacies. The apportionment, in the first instance, and the progressive extinguishment afterward, would be alike productive of ill-humor and animosity.”  –  Alexander Hamilton ,  Federalist No. 7 TIME OUT: SWEATER WEATHER The Atlantic:  “In his 2005 memoir,  Yvon Chouinard , the founder of Patagonia, claimed that his outdoor-clothing company, founded in 1973, was the first to bring the concept to the outdoors community. But the idea goes back further than that. Almost every American’s understanding of layering comes from the mid-century U.S. military. In 1943, the Quartermaster Corps—the branch of the U.S. Army charged with procuring uniforms, among many other essential logistics of war—introduced an experimental new uniform kit, which it named the M-43. The ensemble included a woolen undershirt, a long-sleeved, flannel shirt, and a sweater. … The military shaped Americans’ sense of style in other ways, too. After demobilization, the historian  Paul Fussell  explains, veterans who had gotten used to ‘loose, highly informal’ uniforms were primed to keep shifting men’s fashion toward casual wear. Out were the ‘trim fit and exaggerated shoulders’ of the prewar period. Looking prepared to get one’s hands dirty, as a soldier might in an M-43 jacket, became more important than a tailored appearance.” Flag on the play? -  Email us at  HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM  with your tips, comments or questions.

AFTER DEMS POUNCE, NYT WALKS BACK KAVANAUGH CLAIM  Fox News:  “The New York Times has revised its story to include the fact that several friends of the alleged victim said she told them she did not recall the supposed sexual assault in question. The major revision to the Times' reporting came several hours after various politicians, including virtually all major 2020 Democratic candidates for president, cited the Times' reporting as a reason to impeach Kavanaugh. … Top 2020 Democratic contenders  Kamala Harris ,  Elizabeth Warren ,  Bernie Sanders ,  Beto O'Rourke ,  Cory Booker  and  Julian Castro  announced on Sunday that Supreme Court Associate Justice  Brett Kavanaugh  ‘must be impeached,’ after an uncorroborated and disputed allegation of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh resurfaced in a weekend New York Times piece. The revitalized, longshot push to get Kavanaugh removed from the high court comes as Democrats' apparent effort to impeach President Trump has largely stalled. Trump, for his part, suggested Sunday that Kavanaugh should sue for defamation.” Paper botched rollout -  NYT : “ James Dao , deputy editorial page editor for The Times, said in a statement that the essay was ‘a well-reported and newsworthy account that sheds new light on a matter that provoked significant national debate.’ The Times was roundly criticized for a tweet — which was later deleted — made on its Opinion account on Saturday about the essay that read: ‘Having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her,  Deborah Ramirez  says, it confirmed that she didn’t belong at Yale in the first place.’ Mr. Dao said the tweet ‘was clearly offensive and never should have gone out and we sincerely apologize.’” TRUMP REACHES FOR NEW MEXICO  Axios:  “At a Trump rally back in February in El Paso, Texas, the campaign saw an unexpected pattern in the attendee data – a large crowd of New Mexicans crossed the state line to be there. ‘That was our first glimpse into the idea that there might be something happening,’ the Trump campaign's  Tim Murtaugh  told Axios…. Since then, New Mexico has become an unlikely target for the 2020 Trump campaign. It's the state with the highest percentage of Hispanics and Latinos (about 1 in 2 residents), and it's gone with Democrats in 6 of the last 7 general elections. … Demographers and pollsters tell Axios it's highly unlikely Trump can win New Mexico's 5 electoral votes. The state Latino population is overwhelmingly Democratic. Major New Mexico cities are booming and moving left politically, while Republican strongholds are losing their share of the population. Trump lost New Mexico in 2016, and his net approval rating has plummeted from +17 when he first took office to -13 as of July.” House GOPers chafe at Trump-allied consultants -  Politico:  “House Republicans sparred behind closed doors with Trump-aligned political operatives at a GOP retreat over the new online fundraising platform backed by party leaders and the White House. The fight Thursday over WinRed's data and competitiveness highlights long simmering tensions between GOP lawmakers and operatives allied with the president, and underscores the growing frustrations in the party as they try to hash out a strategy to win back the House next year. … Rep.  Elise Stefanik  (R-N.Y.) specifically raised concerns about data sharing, while other lawmakers were confused with how the operation works and pressed operatives for more information about the fundraising tool, according to aides and lawmakers who were present. Stefanik, who formerly led recruitment efforts for the GOP’s campaign arm, pressed WinRed president  Gerrit Lansing  about whether lawmakers who use the apparatus would have to share their data with other people and questioned how it could be protected, several sources said.” DEM LEADERS DRAW LINE ON GUN LEGISLATION Politico:  “Democratic leaders  Nancy Pelosi  and  Chuck Schumer  warned President Donald Trump on Sunday that any firearm legislation that falls short of universal background checks for gun sales ‘will not get the job done,’ complicating delicate negotiations between the president and a group of senators. Trump has been discussing potential legislation with senators in both parties that would expand background checks but would not go as far as House-passed legislation that would apply them to all gun sales with limited exceptions. Trump issued a veto threat on the House’s background-checks bill earlier this year, and few Republicans in Congress support it. But in a conversation with Trump on Sunday morning, the House speaker and Senate minority leader indicated to Trump that they were taking a much harder line than rank-and-file senators involved in the talks.” Rocky start for shutdown talks -   The Hill:  “Senate government funding talks are off to a rough start with 10 working days to go until the shutdown deadline. The impasse is throwing into question if senators will be able to get any of the fiscal year 2020 bills through the chamber this month, a setback for Republicans who wanted to clear a major package before October. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman  Richard Shelby  (R-Ala.) said he still wants to bring bills to the Senate floor for a vote but warned that lawmakers need to ‘negotiate the terrain.’ ‘We’ve been down that road before,’ he said, asked how the funding talks get unstuck. ‘There’s got to be a resolution to it—it could be sooner. It could be later.’ The partisan breakdown has left lawmakers visibly flummoxed about how to resolve the impasse. Sen.  John Cornyn  (R-Texas) described the negotiations as ‘pretty fragile.’” Lewandowski may use testimony as Senate springboard -  Axios:  “Watch for Trump's former campaign manager at the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday – and not just because of the prospect of a fiery exchange with Chairman  Jerry Nadler . … If  Corey Lewandowski  goes forward with a run for the Senate in his home state of New Hampshire – which he's seriously considering, a spokesperson says –  he'd be the first in Trump's inner circle to test those coattails. … ‘Corey will use [the hearing] as part of the campaign. He will be confrontational to the Democrats. He will be totally loyal to Trump. And he will be playing to the right wing of the party who need to unite behind him in a primary,’  Thomas Rath , former attorney general of New Hampshire and adviser to several GOP presidential candidates, tells Axios. … The Judiciary Committee plans to press for more information about possible obstruction of justice by Trump outlined in  Robert Mueller ’s report, including his asking Lewandowski to press then-Attorney General  Jeff Sessions  to end the Russia investigation.” PLAY-BY-PLAY Days after resigning as National Security Advisor  John Bolton  takes old job back as head of two political action committees –   USA Today Pergram: ‘US political discourse needs more ‘flying flamingos’  –  Fox News AUDIBLE: WEIRD FLEX…  “What health concerns man, you wanna wrestle?”  –  Former Vice President  Joe Biden  said after a reporter asked when he is going to release his medical records to address concerns about his health Friday afternoon in Houston following a campaign event.  FROM THE BLEACHERS “Thank you for making it safe to get into the political waters again. After years as a news junkie with my own election night spreadsheet, the last election and personal life trials sent me into a cave. My sister,  Kirsten , calls me ‘the perfect juror’ because I am oblivious to the events around me and just trying to survive. She forwarded me a story from the Halftime Report a few months ago and it sparked my interest, so I subscribed. I love that I can scroll through the report just as I do my Facebook feed: ‘Nope, nope, nope – oh! That looks interesting!’ I can choose how much to invest or pay attention and that alleviates the anxiety I often feel when I look at the world. Your wit and style and delicious vocabulary keep me entertained, informed and on my toes! I’ve also made ‘I’ll Tell You What’ part of my weekly routine. I often can’t keep up with all the information, but I want to be a good citizen and I appreciate this format and your love of our nation. I love that you are intellectually honest in your analysis. I don’t belong to a political party because, let’s face it, people are people, and I think we often lose our ability to think clearly because we just want our team to win. I know that with you, I’ll get a straight, yet quirky, answer and not spin. You nailed it in ITYW this week talking about the American people being tired of getting yelled at. We are tired. We’re worn down and oftentimes, dejected by the choices in front of us and the hatred being spewed from all directions. I’m no snowflake, but again, thanks for this ‘safe space’ to peek out of my cave and see what’s happening in the world.  Keep up the good work.”  –  Laura Whitney , Paradise, Utah.

YOU’RE DOING IT WRONG  Rocky Mountain Outlook : “It's not every day a man tries to fight a grizzly bear. But it appears that is what happened in Banff [Canadian] National Park in 2015 when  Devin Mitsuing , 35, got out of his truck shirtless and began shouting at the young grizzly while in a ‘boxing stance’ before charging at it, according to an eyewitness to the incident. Caught on camera by a couple of nearby photographers, who were taking pictures of the lone grazing grizzly on Highway 93 and called [the Royal Canadian Mounted Police] after the incident, Mitsuing was later located in Radium, B.C. by RCMP and a Park Warden and charged under the National Parks Act, for disturbing wildlife in a national park.

"A slimmed-down Democratic debate dominated this week’s campaign news — but there were other developments, too. Here’s our weekly catch-up on the  2020 election  and the  Democratic field . A three-hour tour Former Vice President  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  walked into the debate at No. 1 in the polls — and squared off against Nos. 2 through 10 for the first time. To protect himself from incoming attacks, he brought a trusty shield: the legacy of former President Barack Obama. As our colleagues Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns wrote in  our debate overview , Mr. Biden “clung tightly to the legacy of the Obama administration” at the debate in Houston on Thursday, “as an array of progressive challengers, led by Senators  Elizabeth Warren  and  Bernie Sanders , brandished more daring policy promises and questioned Mr. Biden’s political strength.” But Mr. Biden also seemed steadier and better prepared than in previous debates. The nearly three-hour debate (really, it didn’t feel like a minute over two and a half hours!) had its share of memorable moments: Andrew Yang  promised  to give 10 families $1,000 a month for a year; Beto O’Rourke declared that,  “Hell yes,”  his administration would “take your AR-15, your AK-47”; Julián Castro  questioned  Mr. Biden’s ability to remember; Mr. Biden made reference  to a record player ; and Mayor Pete Buttigieg  described his experience  with coming out as gay. Our colleagues’ assessment of the night: The debate showed that time is running short,  and this race is getting testy . Just want some quick takeaways?  Here are six .  Here’s a look at  who experts said won the night . We also  tracked speaking time ,  fact-checked the candidates  and noted that issues like abortion and the gender pay gap  did not come up .  The next round will be bigger The next set of debates are in October, and yes,  they might once again be a set . The billionaire impeachment activist Tom Steyer qualified last weekend, meaning at least 11 candidates are set to participate,  and the Democratic National Committee could split the debate over two nights, Oct. 15 and 16, as a result. In addition to Mr. Steyer and the 10 candidates who debated on Thursday, two more — Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and the self-help author Marianne Williamson — could conceivably qualify. Both have reached the 130,000-donor threshold needed, but Ms. Gabbard only has two qualifying poll results and would need two more by Oct. 1, and Ms. Williamson would need three. Oh, and one other thing:  The New York Times will be one of the debate hosts .  A window into New Hampshire In non-debate news, 19 of the Democratic candidates assembled in New Hampshire for a party convention last weekend. The daylong event served as a test — if an imperfect one — of the New Hampshire primary electorate. What did we learn? Our colleague Katie Glueck was on the ground in Manchester and reported that while several candidates got enthusiastic receptions, no one was embraced quite like Ms. Warren. Read more about  the convention here . Another Republican will challenge Trump Former Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina entered the Republican primary last weekend, criticizing President Trump’s economic stewardship and questioning the financial ethics of his administration. Mr. Sanford, who is also a former congressman, told Alex Burns that he believed Mr. Trump’s popularity was “certainly wide, but perhaps much thinner and much more fragile than people realize.”  As a reminder: Former Representative  Joe Walsh  of Illinois, a one-term congressman turned talk radio provocateur, and former Gov.  William F. Weld  of Massachusetts, who ran for vice president in 2016 on the Libertarian Party ticket, are also running against Mr. Trump.  You can read  the rest of our interview with Mr. Sanford here .  Harris releases long-awaited criminal justice plan; Warren seeks to expand social security  On Monday, Senator  Kamala Harris  of California released a sweeping proposal to overhaul the criminal justice system. Ms. Harris, a former prosecutor, vowed to end mass incarceration and revamp police practices through a progressive wish list of policies, including some ideas she had previously rejected as a district attorney and state attorney general.  The plan  represents perhaps the most ambitious effort of her campaign so far.  Ms. Warren unveiled a plan on Thursday that would give all recipients of Social Security benefits an extra $200 per month.  The plan  would fundamentally alter the funding structure of the program, forcing the very rich to pay much more into Social Security in taxes than they would get out of it in benefits, while most Americans would get far more than they pay in. Read more about  Ms. Harris’s criminal justice plan  and  Ms. Warren’s Social Security plan . In other policy news:  Mr. O’Rourke  called on banks and credit card companies to address gun violence  by refusing to provide services for some firearms sales. In what may be a campaign first, Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio released  a “policy album”  on Spotify, which he titled “A New and Better Agenda.” And finally … Several memes emerged from Thursday’s debate, so we thought we’d share a few. There were a variety of  reactions to Mr. Yang’s free-money play . Some criticism was  aimed at Mr. Castro over his attack on Mr. Biden . And  The Onion  noted Ms. Williamson’s absence from the stage. But  fans of Ms. Williamson  need not despair — she  live-streamed  her own “post-debate commentary” Thursday night."

           Good morning and welcome to  Fox News First .  Here's what you need to know as you start your Monday and the new work week ... New York Times updates Kavanaugh 'bombshell' to note accuser doesn't recall alleged assault  
The New York Times suddenly made a  major revision to its story late Sunday concerning a resurfaced allegation of sexual assault by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh , hours  after virtually all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates had cited the original article as a reason to impeach Kavanaugh . The update included the significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the supposed sexual assault in question at all. The Times also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no comment about the episode. The only first-hand statement concerning the supposed attack in the original piece came from a Clinton-connected lawyer who claimed to have witnessed it. The Times' revision says: ""Editors' Note: An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article."" The update came only after the Federalist's Mollie Hemingway, who reviewed an advance copy of the book, first flagged the omission on Twitter.  Click here to read more about our top story .

 Trump: US 'locked and loaded' against attackers of Saudi oil facility 'depending on verification'; Iran denies involvement 
President Trump on Sunday suggested U.S. investigators had ""reason to believe"" they knew who launched crippling attacks against a key Saudi oil facility, and  vowed that America was ""locked and loaded depending on verification.""  While he did not specify in his tweet who he believed was responsible for Saturday's drone attacks, U.S. investigators previously have pointed the finger at Iran. For its part,  Iran has denied the allegations . Earlier Sunday, Trump authorized the use of emergency oil reserves in Texas and other states after Saudi oil processing facilities were attacked, sparking fears of a spike in oil prices when markets reopen Monday. 
      
       (AP) Beto hits Buttigieg, Dems with expletive-driven defense of debate comments on gun confiscation Beto O’Rourke on Sunday launched an expletive-fueled defense  of his call to ban assault-style weapons and impose mandatory buybacks of AR-15s and AK-47s while also pushing back at critics -- including fellow 2020 Democrat Pete Buttigieg. During last Thursday’s presidential debate, the former Texas congressman said, “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47, and we’re not going to allow it to be used against your fellow Americans anymore.” Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday and agreed with Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., saying the clip of O’Rourke’s statement about AR-15s and AK-47s “will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns.” Buttigieg went on to say, “When even this president and even [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell are at least are pretending to be open to reforms, we know that we have a moment on our hand. Let’s make the most of it and get these things done.” O'Rourke pushed back, tweeting, “When candidates say, 'At least Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are pretending to be interested,' sh--, that is not enough. Neither is poll-testing your message. Gun violence is a life or death issue—and we have to represent the bold ideas of people all over the country.”

"'Unfreedom on the Press' author Mark Levin on the media's blatant anti-Trump bias. Mark Levin  said Friday that the  2020 Democratic presidential primary field  is the weakest lineup of contenders he's ever witnessed, calling several of the top-tier candidates ""narcissistic."" Many of the Dems are also making irrational policy promises that would damage the country, radio host  Levin  claimed on "" The Mark Levin Show""  on Westwood One. ""Those running for the nomination for the Democratic Party -- among the weakest field in American history, truly,"" he said. ""These are the weakest candidates I've ever seen."" UNIVISION'S JORGE RAMOS CLASHES WITH BIDEN AT DEM DEBATE Levin pointed out former Vice President  Joe Biden's  penchant for gaffes, then went through the list of candidates who appeared along with Biden at Thursday's democratic debate in Houston. First, Levin characterized Sen.  Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., as what he considered to be a standard left-wing activist from Brooklyn, N.Y. Then he moved on to other 2020 hopefuls. "" Elizabeth Warren ? You kidding me?"" he said. "" Cory Booker  -- he did such a great job there in Newark,"" the "" Life, Liberty & Levin "" host added, pointing to the U.S. senator's tenure as mayor of New Jersey's largest city from 2006 to 2013. He said, however, that Sen.  Amy Klobuchar , D-Minn., appeared to be the ""most rational"" candidate onstage Thursday, but still has political flaws. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""It's really bizarre, these people. And they're so narcissistic, so irrational, so immature -- all of them,"" Levin said. The former Reagan Justice Department official added many of the candidates were expressing support for very liberal policies. ""Hey, that guy over there has more than me -- 'OK, I'll take it from him and give it to you',"" he remarked. ""They all sound like [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.]."""
"WASHINGTON — He’s in our heads. Even more than we knew. It isn’t just that he hovered over the Democratic debate on Thursday night: Should the candidates attack him or leave him to self-destruct? Were they talking about him too much or not enough? It’s more profound than that. Donald Trump has fundamentally altered the way we experience politics. We’ve been trying to figure out for three years if he is a mad aberration, doomed to fade, or if he is rewiring the game in some permanent way. Watching that depressing debate, one must conclude that the rewiring is well underway. Trump is one of the phoniest people ever to walk the earth. Maybe that’s why he was uniquely suited to tear through the phony conventions and bloated world of consultants that made up politics as usual. There were a lot of good politicians on the debate stage in Houston. But the night rang hollow as they clung to the old conventions — the overcoached performances, the canned lines, the pandering, the well-worn childhood anecdotes meant to project “relatability.” Tactics superseded passion and vision. Everyone seemed one tick off. Unlike with Barack Obama in 2008, none made you feel like you wanted to pump your fist in the air and march into the future behind them. “Being a good politician doesn’t matter anymore,” lamented one freaked-out congressional Democrat afterward. “It’s like being a great used car salesman. We need a Holden Caulfield to call out all the phonies.” It’s a paradox wrapped in an oxymoron about a moron: Trump’s faux-thenticity somehow makes the Democratic candidates seem more packaged, more stuck in politician-speak. In speeches and at rallies, Trump kicks over the traces, saying what’s on his mind, even though it often doesn’t mesh with reality, even though it lacks dignity and can be ugly and hateful. Just consider his  speech at the House Republican retreat  in Baltimore, happening at the same time as the debate. Basking in chants of “Four more years!” Trump unleashed several buzzwords and crowd-pleasers, trashing eco-friendly paper straws and energy-efficient light bulbs. “The bulb that we’re being forced to use — No. 1, to me, most importantly, the light is no good,” he said. “I always look orange. And so do you. The light is the worst. But No. 2, it’s many times more expensive than that old incandescent bulb that worked very well. And very importantly — I don’t know if you know this — they have warnings. If it breaks, it’s considered a hazardous waste site. It’s gases inside.” “And,” the Narcissus president repeated a couple of times for good measure, “the light is not as good. I mean, frankly, the light is not as good.” He offered his usual aria of insults to the assembled shameless Republicans, calling Elizabeth Warren “Pocahontas” and Joe Biden “Sleepy Joe.” “And now it looks like she could beat Sleepy Joe,” Trump said. “He’s fallen asleep. He has no idea what the hell he’s doing or saying.” He made a Pete Buttigieg short joke and referred to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as “Cortez” because her name, he said, is too long. He called the squad “A.O.C. plus three” and warned of the “grim specter of socialism.” He mocked the Green New Deal, saying: “That’s a beauty. No more cows. No more planes. I guess no more people, right?” Then he teased Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader: “Because Kevin is just like a cow. He’s just smaller.” The split screen Thursday night was riveting. You know that the barbarian behind the White House gates will run with all the ammunition the Democrats were supplying him in real time. The president said, “Democrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans,” and Beto O’Rourke said, “Hell, yes, we are going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.” The president said the Democrats would impose “crippling taxes,” and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren proposed all their free stuff that would require tax hikes. This exact display from Trump is just what many Americans find exhausting. It’s draining to live on the edge all the time, to be plunged into the culture wars — and now the straw and light-bulb wars — with the tweets and the tantrums and the put-downs, to feel that we’re being borne back ceaselessly into the past. But how to counter this? “No one made the broadest, most appealing message for change,” David Axelrod said of the debate. “Can we, as a country, function any more if we have another four years of waking up to turmoil?” There were a bunch of high-end, professional pols there and yet no one actually won it. Not a good sign. The candidates struggled to alchemize our exhaustion into excitement. The three hours seemed endless, with two questions hanging over the night: “Can’t anybody here play this game?” and “Will the most beatable candidate in American history win twice?” The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters  to the editor.

"Raymond Arroyo breaks down his Democratic debate edition of 'Friday Follies.' Remember the exciting, unpredictable and entertaining 2015-16  Republican  presidential debates?  Who would candidate  Donald Trump  take down this week?  How would he dominate media questioners yet again? Whether you were for Trump, appalled by him or just curious, each debate was worth watching. DEBATE DESCENDS INTO MELEE OVER HEALTH CARE, OBAMA, SOCIALISM AS DEMS STRUGGLE TO SHOW UNITY Trump was so different – and so cheerfully direct and aggressive – that people began to see the debates as a sort of reality TV (which is what they should be). Our country is better when more people want to watch political debates and participate in elections. By contrast, Thursday’s Democratic debate was a bore, with an old-time politician tone that made it painful to sit through. After about 30 minutes of policy-wonk jargon about incomprehensible details of health policy, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., remarked: ""This discussion has given the American people a headache."" Like or dislike Trump, I can’t imagine a participant in a Trump-energized presidential debate saying – as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg did – that the debates ""are becoming unwatchable."" The most revealing moment of the debate may have been former Vice President Joe Biden’s comment that to help poor children learn more words, parents should “make sure you have the record player on at night.” CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER It may be tricky for Democrats if they nominate someone in  2020  who is mentally in a world of record players. It will be quite difficult to try to be the party of the future when you have a candidate of the past. Similarly, the more radical candidates – virtually everyone other than the two semi-moderates, Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. – seemed to be in a contest to alienate the most Americans. Just in case the talk about ""Medicare-for-all,"" getting rid of private insurance, defunding charter schools and the usual left-wing radicalism wasn’t enough, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas set the classic example of driving away voters and alienating entire regions of the country. Similarly, the more radical candidates – virtually everyone other than the two semi-moderates, Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. – seemed to be in a contest to alienate the most Americans. When debate moderator David Muir of ABC News questioned O’Rourke about his recent comments about firearms bans and confiscations, Muir asked bluntly: ""Are you proposing taking away their guns?"" Apparently, O’Rourke wanted to make absolutely certain that the millions of law-abiding Americans who own guns would understand that his candidacy was a mortal threat to their freedom and Second Amendment rights. ""Hell, yes, we're going to take away your AR-15, your AK-47,"" O'Rourke said. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also reminded millions of Americans about her elitist isolation from most people when she said: ""I've actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company."" Warren’s comment is quite revealing since the  Kaiser Family Foundation  reported that 58 percent of Americans oppose a health care policy plan that would force them to give up the private insurance option. Only 37 percent favored getting rid of all private health insurance. Meanwhile, support for “Medicare-for-all” continues to drop when Americans’ are told it would raise their taxes (37 percent), threaten the current Medicare program (32 percent), and cause delays in treatment (26 percent). CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Warren, of course, represents the 37 percent. President Trump would (and will) be happy to defend the 58 percent. Every time there is another boring, wonkish and disconnected Democratic debate like this, the 2020 Trump victory will become bigger and bigger. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH"
"Political analyst Ron Meyer and Democratic strategist Jason Nichols react to the Democratic debate. Liberal filmmaker  Michael Moore  said Friday night that Sen.  Elizabeth Warren,  D-Mass., probably doesn't really consider herself a capitalist, despite the senator's past claim of being one. Moore made the comments on ""Real Time with  Bill Maher ,"" after the host suggested ""capitalism plus"" was a better term than ""socialism"" for Warren's platform. ""Elizabeth Warren says she's a capitalist,"" Maher said to Moore. ""Are you not OK with Elizabeth Warren not being far enough for the left?"" MICHAEL MOORE WARNS DEMS 'PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN' CAN'T BEAT TRUMP: 'I LOVE JOE BIDEN... BUT WE GOTTA WIN' ""I'm not so sure she believes that,"" Moore responded. ""So she's a liar?,"" Maher reacted, joking that his next film would be titled, ""'Warren is a Liar: Michael Moore.'"" ""No, no,"" Moore clarified. ""She's taking a cue from you, which is you've got to tone it down because people are gonna be nervous."" The ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" director went on to claim that ""old capitalism is gone"" and that ""new capitalism is a cruel and evil system"" that can't be fixed.

"Beto O’Rourke gives his take on the latest sexual assault allegation against a Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh. Update ,  10:00 p.m. ET : The New York Times has  revised its story  to include the fact that several friends of the alleged victim said she told them she did not recall the supposed sexual assault in question. The major revision to the Times' reporting  came several hours  after various politicians, including virtually all major 2020 Democratic candidates for president, cited the Times' reporting as a reason to impeach Kavanaugh. Full story  here. Original story below: Top 2020 Democratic contenders  Kamala Harris ,  Elizabeth Warren ,  Bernie Sanders ,  Beto O'Rourke ,  Cory Booker  and  Julian Castro  announced on Sunday that Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh ""must be impeached,"" after an uncorroborated and disputed allegation of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh resurfaced in a weekend  New York Times piece. The revitalized, longshot push to get Kavanaugh removed from the high court comes as Democrats'  apparent effort to impeach  President Trump has  largely stalled . Trump, for his part,  suggested  Sunday that Kavanaugh should sue for defamation. The Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate,  Clinton-connected  nonprofit CEO  Max Stier , ""saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."" The Times did not mention  Stier's work as a Clinton defense attorney , or Stier's  legal battles with Kavanaugh  during the Whitewater investigation, and simply called him a ""respected thought leader."" According to the Times, Stier ""notified senators and the FBI about this account"" last year during the Kavanaugh hearings, ""but the FBI did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly."" However, the Times' article also conspicuously did not mention that Pogrebin and Kelly's book found that the female student in question had denied any knowledge of the alleged episode. ""The book notes, quietly, that the woman Max Stier named as having been supposedly victimized by Kavanaugh and friends denies any memory of the alleged event,"" observed The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway. ""Seems, I don’t know, significant."" 'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED' CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS TO PUT POLITICAL 'ASTERISK' ON KAVANAUGH, LAWYER ADMITS The book  reads : ""[Tracy] Harmon, whose surname is now Harmon Joyce, has also refused to discuss the incident, though several of her friends said she does not recall it.""

Ramirez went public with allegations that while in his first year at Yale University, Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh placed his penis in front of her and caused her to involuntarily touch it during a drunken dormitory party. Kavanaugh denied the accusation. (Safehouse Progressive Alliance for Nonviolence via AP)
       ""Omitting these facts from the  @nytimes  story is one of worst cases of journalistic malpractice that I can recall,"" wrote the National Review's Washington correspondent, John McCormack on Twitter. McCormack  wrote separately : ""If Kavanaugh’s 'friends pushed his penis,' then isn’t it an allegation of wrongdoing against Kavanaugh’s 'friends,' not Kavanaugh himself? Surely even a modern liberal Yalie who’s been to one of those  weird non-sexual 'naked parties ' would recognize both the female student and Kavanaugh are both alleged victims in this alleged incident, barring an additional allegation that a college-aged Kavanaugh asked his 'friends' to 'push his penis.'"" NEW YORK TIMES DELETES TWEET CALLING UNPROVOKED PENIS THRUSTING 'HARMLESS FUN' The Times went on to note in the article that it had ""corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier,"" but the article apparently meant only that the Times had corroborated that Stier made his claim to the FBI. No first-hand corroboration of the alleged episode was apparently obtained. ""False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop?"" Nevertheless, Democrats announced a new effort to topple Kavanaugh. Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono -- who infamously said last year that Kavanaugh  did not deserve a fair hearing because he might be pro-life  -- said the Senate Judiciary Committee should begin an impeachment inquiry to determine whether Kavanaugh lied to Congress. Impeaching Kavanaugh would require a majority vote in the Democratic-controlled House, and a highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-majority Senate would then be needed to remove him from the bench. No Supreme Court justice or president has ever been convicted by the Senate, although eight lower-level federal judges have been. The long odds didn't stop 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls from joining in on the effort. ""I sat through those hearings,"" Harris wrote on Twitter. ""Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached."" During the hearings, Harris  strongly implied  that she knew Kavanaugh had improperly discussed Special Counsel Robert Mueller's then-ongoing probe with a Trump-connected lawyer. Harris provided no evidence for the bombshell insinuation, which went viral on social media and  sent the hearing room into stunned silence , even as she directly accused Kavanaugh of lying under oath. Castro and Warren echoed that sentiment and said Kavanaugh had committed perjury. FLASHBACK: GRAHAM SAYS DEMS' KAVANAUGH SMEARS HAVE UNITED REPUBLICANS FLASHBACK: FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS KAVANAUGH FIGHT HAS REVITALIZED GOP BASE, INCREASED REPUBLICAN INTEREST IN ELECTION ""It’s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath,"" Castro wrote. ""He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter."" Warren  wrote:  ""Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."" O'Rourke claimed to ""know"" that Kavanaugh had lied under oath, and falsely said that the new accuser was not known to Senate Democrats or the FBI last year. ""Yesterday, we learned of another accusation against Brett Kavanaugh—one we didn't find out about before he was confirmed because the Senate forced the F.B.I. to rush its investigation to save his nomination,"" O'Rourke said. ""We know he lied under oath. He should be impeached."" Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.,  tweeted  in part, ""This new allegation and additional corroborating evidence adds to a long list of reasons why Brett Kavanaugh should not be a Supreme Court justice. I stand with survivors and countless other Americans in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin."" Amy Klobuchar stopped short of calling for impeachment, and instead posted a picture of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford with the words, ""Let us never forget what courage looks like."" DEM SENATOR CITES KAVANAUGH'S ALLEGED PRO-LIFE LEANINGS AS REASON TO DENY HIM A FAIR HEARING  Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, said he backed getting rid of Kavanaugh by any legal means available: ""The revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable."" As the calls mounted, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., shot back Sunday afternoon on  Twitter  -- and made clear that Kavanaugh wasn't going anywhere. ""The far left’s willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year’s confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate,"" McConnell wrote. He added: ""Fortunately a majority of Senators and the American people rallied behind timeless principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence. I look forward to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh."" The Times' piece also stated that well before Kavanaugh became a federal judge, ""at least seven people"" had heard about how he allegedly exposed himself to Deborah Ramirez at a party. Ramirez had called classmates at Yale seeking corroboration for her story, and even told some of her classmates that she could not remember the culprit in the alleged episode -- before changing her mind and publicly blaming Kavanaugh ""after six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney,""  the New Yorker reported last year  in a  widely derided  piece. The Senate Judiciary Committee, then led by Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote in an  executive summary of its investigation  that it contacted Ramirez’s counsel ""seven times seeking evidence to support claims made in the New Yorker,"" but that ""Ms. Ramirez produced nothing in response and refused a Committee request for an interview."" Late Sunday, Grassley's office called out the Times for omitting key details in the story published this weekend. "" @NYTimes  did not contact Sen. Grassley’s office for this story. If they had, we would've reminded them of a few key public facts they omitted,"" Grassley's team wrote. ""Despite 7 attempts by staff, Ms. Ramirez' lawyers declined to provide documentary evidence referenced in the article/witness accounts to support the claims. They also declined invitations for Ms. Ramirez to speak with committee investigators or to provide a written statement."" Additionally, the FBI separately reached out to nearly a dozen individuals to corroborate the allegations by Ford and Ramirez, and ultimately spoke to ten individuals and two eyewitnesses, but apparently found no corroboration. The agency's investigation began after then-Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., called for a one-week delay in Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings so an independent agency could look into the claims against him. Flake said the FBI's probe  needed to be limited in length  to avoid derailing the proceedings with endless claims and probes going back to Kavanaugh's high school years. Kavanaugh, predicted by Democrats during his confirmation process to be a hardline conservative, often sided with liberal justices during the Supreme Court's last term. The president, meanwhile, accused the media of trying to influence Kavanaugh. He also went on to say that Kavanaugh should go on the offensive and take on the media for false statements. ""Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can’t let that happen!"" he  tweeted. Grassley  sent several criminal referrals  to the Justice Department related to alleged lies submitted to Senate investigators during Kavanaugh's confirmation process -- which could be what the president meant when he wrote Sunday that the DOJ ""should come to [Kavanuagh's] rescue."" One of those referrals was for  now-disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti  and one of his clients, Julie Swetnick, regarding a potential ""conspiracy"" to provide false statements to Congress and obstruct its investigation.  Swetnick's credibility took a hit  as she changed her story about Kavanaugh's purported gang-rape trains, and her ex-boyfriend went public to say she was known for ""exaggerating everything."" Swetnick and Ramirez were just two of several women who had accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct during his confirmation process. Ford most notably testified that Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault her at a party when they were teens, and  dubiously asserted  that the memory was ""indelible"" in her ""hippocampus"" -- although no witnesses could corroborate her  ever-changing story  --  even her close lifelong friend, Leland Keyser , who Ford said had attended the party. Keyser, according to the Times reporters' new book,  did not believe Ford's story  -- and refused to change her mind, despite pressure from progressive activists and Ford's friends. ""It just didn't make any sense,"" Keyser said, referring to Ford's explanation of how she was assaulted at a party that Keyser attended, but could not recall how she got home. Ford's attorney,  Debra Katz , was quoted in a new book as saying that Ford was motivated to come forward in part by a desire to tag Kavanaugh's reputation with an ""asterisk"" before he could start ruling on abortion-related cases. ""In the aftermath of these hearings, I believe that Christine’s testimony brought about more good than the harm misogynist Republicans caused by allowing Kavanaugh on the court,"" Katz said. ""He will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important. ""It is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine."" The Federalist  reported last week  that Ford's father  privately supported Kavanaugh's confirmation , and approached Ed Kavanaugh on a golf course to make his support clear. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Some claims that surfaced during Kavanaugh's confirmation fell apart within days. For example, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., received a call from an anonymous constituent who claimed that in 1985, two ""heavily inebriated men"" referred to as ""Brett and Mark"" had sexually assaulted a friend of hers on a boat. The Twitter account belonging to the accuser apparently  advocated for a military coup  against the Trump administration. The constituent recanted the sexual assault claim on the social media site days later. Fox News' Andrew Craft in Plano, Texas, Chad Pergram, and Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report."
"Senator  Elizabeth Warren  of Massachusetts brought her ascendant presidential campaign to New York City on Monday night, unspooling a forceful argument for attacking corruption in government in a defining speech of her White House bid.  Addressing thousands of supporters in Washington Square Park, some holding up “I’m a Warren Democrat” signs, Ms. Warren pressed her case to bring sweeping change to an economic and political system she views as fundamentally tilted to favor the wealthy and powerful.  She spoke near the site of the  Triangle shirtwaist factory fire  of 1911, which killed 146  garment  workers, most of them women. The fire spurred a push to improve workplace safety, which Ms. Warren harnessed as a parallel for the far-reaching change she wants to pursue as president. And once again, she urged Democrats to embrace her call for dramatic change — not the kind of incremental approach favored most notably by  Joseph R. Biden Jr. , the former vice president and the primary race’s front-runner.  “There’s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared,” Ms. Warren said from a lectern in front of the park’s marble arch. “But we can’t choose a candidate we don’t believe in just because we’re too scared to do anything else. And Democrats can’t win if we’re scared and looking backward.” Ms. Warren was introduced by  Maurice Mitchell , the national director of the Working Families Party, which  announced its endorsement of her  earlier Monday. In her speech, Ms. Warren described President Trump as “corruption in the flesh,” but added that “our problems didn’t start with Donald Trump.”  And in invoking the Triangle factory workers, she made explicit reference to the power of women to bring about change. “We’re not here today because of famous arches or famous men,” Ms. Warren told the crowd. “In fact, we’re not here because of men at all. We’re here because of some hard-working women.” Throughout her remarks, Ms. Warren was repeatedly met with enthusiastic cheers, and the crowd broke into chants of “two cents” when Ms. Warren brought up her proposal to impose a 2 percent annual tax on the fortunes of the super rich. Beyond amplifying her call to confront corruption, a hallmark of her presidential bid, the speech was another chance for Ms. Warren to  draw a big crowd  on the campaign trail and put on display the enthusiasm she is generating among voters. In August, she drew 15,000 people in Seattle and 12,000 in St. Paul, according to her campaign. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation said organizers had anticipated a crowd of 8,000 to 10,000 people for Monday’s speech.  Ms. Warren’s campaign said the crowd exceeded 20,000, though that estimate could not be independently verified. With each big rally, Ms. Warren is solidifying her place in an exclusive club of presidential candidates who have become crowd magnets, exhilarating fans at events that can sometimes feel like rock concerts.  In the 2004 election, it was Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, whose  large crowds  — including a big showing in Bryant Park in New York in August 2003 — offered a visibly striking signal of interest in his candidacy.  Barack Obama drew enormous crowds in the 2008 race, including at a  giant rally in Washington Square Park  in September 2007. And in the 2016 election, Mr. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont were both buoyed by the electric crowds they commanded. Mr. Sanders, too,  held a huge event in Washington Square Park , drawing a crowd before the 2016 New York primary that his campaign put at 27,000 people, though he went on to lose that contest to Hillary Clinton. Mr. Sanders has drawn big crowds this year as well. The recent history of crowd-magnet candidates offers a mixed track record of electoral success. Joe Trippi, who was Mr. Dean’s campaign manager, said Ms. Warren was well positioned to draw sizable crowds in big cities, given her large email list and many grass-roots donors around the country. That is particularly true in a Democratic stronghold like New York; for example, through the end of June, Ms. Warren  had an estimated 1,300 donors  in a single ZIP code in Brooklyn that includes most of Park Slope. But Mr. Trippi cautioned that drawing a large audience in a big city does not necessarily translate to success in the early voting states. “The question is, can you build beyond that core into a more diverse Democratic constituency?” Mr. Trippi asked. “Fifteen thousand people in Seattle does not equal winning South Carolina.” Asked last week whether she thought crowd size mattered, Ms. Warren replied, “I think it matters getting to talk to lots and lots and lots and lots of people.” Earlier Monday, Ms. Warren unveiled an  expansive plan to attack corruption  in government, a central theme of her campaign. The plan is based on a wide-ranging anticorruption package she first proposed last year. On the campaign trail, she likes to call it “the biggest anticorruption plan since Watergate.” Ms. Warren kicked off her campaign  with a speech in Lawrence, Mass.,  at the Everett Mills, where textile workers went on strike in 1912. On Monday, she again invoked the setting of her speech, recalling the horrific scene of the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire. Before the fire, she said,  female  factory workers across New York City had been “sounding the alarm” about their working conditions, but were no match for wealthy and well-connected factory owners.  “The tragic story of the Triangle factory fire is a story about power,” Ms. Warren said. “A story of what happens when the rich and the powerful take control of government and use it to increase their own profits while they stick it to working people. But what happened in the aftermath of the fire is a different story about power — a story about our power, a story about what’s possible when we fight together as one.” Ms. Warren told the story of  Frances Perkins , citing her efforts after the Triangle factory fire to improve conditions for workers, and, later,  her tenure as labor secretary  for Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  Ms. Warren presented Ms. Perkins — “one very persistent woman,”  she called her, drawing cheers  — as a template of sorts for how a President Warren could bring about change. “She used the same model that she and her friends had used after the Triangle fire: She worked the political system relentlessly from the inside while a sustained movement applied pressure from the outside,” Ms. Warren said, citing legacies like Social Security and the minimum wage. Even the lectern from which Ms. Warren delivered those lines had a connection to Ms. Perkins, who was the first female cabinet member: It was made with reclaimed wood  from the Frances Perkins  Homestead in Maine, her campaign said.  As is her custom, Ms. Warren stayed after her speech to take pictures with anyone who wanted one. Linus Glenhaber, 18, a college student from Massachusetts, worked on his science homework as he waited.  He praised Ms. Warren for how she reached back into American history as she spoke of corruption. “When she was talking about the Triangle shirtwaist factory,” he said, “it felt relevant to today in this incredible way.” Ms. Warren finished taking pictures around 11:40 p.m. — nearly four hours after she finished her speech. One figure who did not seem to factor into Monday’s proceedings was New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, who like Ms. Warren is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. “The mayor of this city is still running, and Elizabeth Warren turned this city out,” said City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer of Queens, who  endorsed Ms. Warren  last week. “I’m not being mean, but it’s got to be devastating for him. But it’s great for us.”"
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks about new claims against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Senate Republican  leaders on Monday unloaded on Democrats over their  revived efforts to push college-era allegations  of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accusing them of engaging in “not normal political behavior.” McConnell, R-Ky., took to the Senate floor Monday afternoon to decry what he described as a familiar “pattern” involving Kavanaugh allegations: “Shoot first, correct the facts later.” He accused Democrats of “rushing to exploit” the new accusations and “hysterically” demanding his impeachment, but maintained that a majority of senators were right to confirm him last year. He also accused Democrats of deploying the “politics of personal destruction” in their handling of both sets of allegations. 2020 DEMOCRATS IGNORE KAVANAUGH STORY CORRECTION AFTER DEMANDING IMPEACHMENT “It’s just as transparent and self-serving today,” McConnell said. In his blistering floor speech, he went on to rebuke several Senate Democrats  for a recent brief  that urged the Supreme Court to “heal itself” or face restructuring – which was widely seen as a threat of court-packing. 
“This is not normal political behavior,” McConnell said. South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Judiciary Committee chairman who mounted one of the most passionate defenses of Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing, called the attacks “beyond the pale.” “My heart goes out to Justice Kavanaugh’s family for being forced to endure this ridiculous treatment once again,” he  tweeted. Many of the Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump in 2020 over the weekend released statements calling for Congress to impeach Kavanaugh, citing The New York Times' reporting of a disputed allegation of sexual misconduct. But Graham insisted that wouldn't happen. “As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I promise you Justice Kavanaugh will not be impeached over these scurrilous accusations,” Graham tweeted. Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, who led the Judiciary Committee during the Kavanaugh hearings, said his office never ""received an allegation against Kavanaugh like the one referenced in the report over the weekend."" ""We now have an uncorroborated accusation, rooted only in unnamed sources, with no direct knowledge of the event, and that the alleged victim doesn’t even remember,"" Grassley said. ""Since when did that become something 'fit to print' by the supposed American paper of record?"" By late Sunday, the paper had revised its portrayed blockbuster story to include the fact that several friends of the alleged victim said she told them she did not recall the reported sexual assault in question. President Trump repeatedly ripped the paper on Monday. ""The New York Times should close its doors and throw away the keys,"" he  tweeted  Monday afternoon, reacting to quotes from Fox News' Greg Gutfeld. ""The women mentioned in the Kavanaugh story said she didn’t even remember the event."" As for Democrats, California Sen. Kamala Harris, who said over the weekend that Kavanaugh “must be impeached,” did not back down in a new  tweet  Monday, writing: “The reality of Kavanaugh's confirmation process is that it lacked any integrity — there has never been a meaningful investigation into these allegations. We need the truth.” The Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Clinton-connected nonprofit CEO Max Stier, “saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.” Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro tweeted in response: “It’s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter.” Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote: “Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.” NYT UPDATES KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' TO NOTE ACCUSER DOESN'T RECALL ALLEGED ASSAULT While 2020 Democrats did not back down from their impeachment calls, despite the Times revision, top Democrats in Congress appeared less eager. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., seemed to brush off his party's calls to launch impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh,  saying on a radio show Monday : “We have our hands full with impeaching the president right now.” Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters: “I am saying nothing on Kavanaugh right now.” Fox News’ Judson Berger, Chad Pergram and Gregory Re contributed to this report."
"Doctors can be among the highest-earning professionals in the country, but they are also among those saddled with the most student loans. The average medical student who graduates with debt owes $200,000, with several years of modest pay ahead as a resident or fellow, according to data from the Association of American Medical Colleges. Concerned that young doctors were being driven by financial pressures to become specialists rather than practice pediatrics or family medicine, some prominent universities have begun using major gifts from donors to relieve students from having to borrow to pay tuition.  On Monday, Cornell University went even further. Its medical school, Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, announced that all students who qualify for financial aid will get a full ride: All costs will be covered by scholarships, including tuition, room and board, books and other educational expenses. “Student debt has been in the national discussion for a long time, and we have been planning, strategizing and raising money,” said Dr. Augustine M.K. Choi, the dean of Weill Cornell Medicine and provost for medical affairs at Cornell University. “It’s the right time to offer debt-free medical education .” Doctors as a group are hardly economically disadvantaged. They are  more likely to be in the top 1 percent  of the nation’s earners than members of any other profession. Those who enter the most lucrative specializations, especially, stand a good chance of being able to pay off their student debts with less difficulty than most other Americans, even though they borrow so much.  Still, the announcement on Monday added Weill-Cornell to a growing list of prominent medical schools that have recently rolled out generous financial aid programs to ease the way for future doctors.  In 2017, Columbia University  announced a new endowment that  it said would eliminate the need for medical students to take out loans for tuition; the neediest would also have living expenses covered. The David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles,  offers full rides  to about 20 percent of its entering classes, though the awards are based on merit, not need. In August 2018, the New York University School of Medicine  said it would cover  tuition for all its current and future students. “The rising cost of higher education has become a major concern for donors committed to expanding access to elite institutions for low-income and first-generation students,” said David Callahan, the author of “The Givers: Money, Power and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age” and the editor of the website  Inside Philanthropy . “Against a larger backdrop of growing concern about inequality, more donors are giving for scholarships and financial assistance — as opposed to more high-profile things like new buildings and cutting-edge research,” he said. “In this case, these concerns are surely amplified by reports of a coming shortage of doctors, especially in rural areas.” Of Weill Cornell’s 373 students, 52 percent qualify for need-based aid. A single year at the school — which sits in one of America’s most expensive ZIP codes, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan — costs more than $90,000,  according to Weill Cornell . With need-based grants for the last academic year averaging about $38,000, students often relied on federal loans to bridge the difference. The average debt for a  graduate of the program this year was $156,851. “There’s no question that this financial burden adds to the stress and also physician burnout when they become full physicians and join the work force,” Dr. Choi said. A  recent study  showed that long hours, disrupted sleep and stress can advance cellular aging in new doctors. Students learned of the surprise gift on Monday morning at a campus event.  September was the natural time  for such an announcement, said Jessica M. Bibliowicz, chairman of the Weill Cornell Medicine Board of Overseers.  “ We want those first-year students to know that this is what is going to happen as they go through their medical studies,” Ms. Bibliowicz said. “They can make the kind of choices they want to make in their medical career.”  The program covers all eligible students going forward, but not retroactively, so the incoming class of first-year students stands to benefit the most. Need-based loans that have already been distributed for the current year will be “converted” to scholarship grants in the next few weeks, the school said, once students complete some paperwork. “I immediately burst into tears,” Catherine Han, 24, said of sitting in the audience and learning that her remaining three years would not cost her anything. “I feel like the pressure that students know was bearing down on me, and it just started to lift off. And I feel so light now because it’s really life-changing.” Ms. Han, who is beginning her second year, said her father is a postal worker and her mother is a hospital technician. “I will be able to take care of my parents years faster than if this wasn’t offered, and that is such a burden off my mind,” she said. “I feel like I can focus on what I’m learning in the present and on becoming the best physician I can.” Neil Kelly, also in his second year, said medical students who were less preoccupied by financial stresses can focus more on caring for patients. “It gives you that ability, moving forward, to not have to worry about the money playing a role in your specialty,” he said.  Mr. Kelly, 32, said his wife was expecting the couple’s second child. “It’s really difficult to make it work in the city on one income, and to have multiple children,” he said.  Financial concerns may deter doctors from practicing in communities where many patients are on Medicaid. Doctors have become  scarce in many rural areas , where they often have trouble earning enough to pay off their debts. Some  113 rural hospitals have closed  since 2010, according to the National Rural Health Association. “While medical education remains an excellent investment for students, philanthropic support for medical schools’ financial aid programs can help recruit students from diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds who are more likely to practice in underserved communities,” said Matthew Shick, senior director of government relations for the Association of American Medical Colleges. Weill Cornell had a scholarship endowment of $150 million before it announced a new $160 million gift on Monday. The school needs about $50 million more in the coming years to ensure that the program continues in perpetuity, Dr. Choi said, adding that he felt “very confident” it would reach that number. The school said that the gifts came, in large part, from the Starr Foundation as well as Joan and Sanford I. Weill and the Weill Family Foundation. The Weills are the institution’s biggest benefactors. “We all know that philanthropy is finite,” said Ms. Bibliowicz, who is also the Weills’ daughter. “And there are many, many needs out there for our medical school, continued science and clinical care, but we really felt that this was the best use of philanthropic dollars.”  Discussions over student debt have intensified in recent months as Democratic presidential candidates and prominent citizens have floated ambitious plans to make higher education debt-free. Many have welcomed these plans, but others have pushed back, citing high costs or what they see as bitter unfairness to those who have diligently paid down their student loans.  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has proposed  eliminating all student debt , while Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  wants to wipe out  a substantial portion of it. Both are also seeking trillion-dollar plans to make undergraduate programs at public colleges and universities free."
"Warren won the WFP's support through an online vote, earning nearly 61% support from a combination of the party's members, supporters and national committee. Sen.  Bernie Sanders , who was endorsed by the WFP ahead of the 2016 primary with 87% of the vote, scored only 35.8% this time around. The nearly 2-to-1 margin of defeat will sting Sanders supporters and further embolden Warren, as she seeks to edge out her colleague and ideological ally as the leading progressive primary choice -- and stake her claim as the top Democratic challenger to moderate former Vice President Joe Biden.   WFP leadership sought to play down the vote as the sign of any potential rift on the left. Its national director, Maurice Mitchell, touted Warren's fierce populism in a statement, saying she ""strikes fear into the hearts of the robber barons who rigged the system, and offers hope to millions of working people who have been shut out of our democracy and economy."" But he added that Democrats were ""lucky"" to have both Warren, who will deliver a speech Monday night in New York City, and Sanders in the race and credited them for their work to shift the boundaries of debate within the Democratic Party. ""Senator Warren and Senator Sanders have both shaped the ideological terrain on which this campaign is being waged,"" Mitchell said. ""They have proven an effective team on debate stages and in the polls, and we hope that partnership continues. We're proud to call both of them allies in the fight for a more just America."" The WFP, which was born and is primarily based in New York City, has been expanding its reach and influence since President Donald Trump's election in 2016. Last year, it endorsed Cynthia Nixon in her progressive, but ultimately failed, primary challenge to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a move that alienated it from the Democratic Party establishment in the state.  But the party found success down the ballot, helping to elect a slate of mostly young progressive state lawmakers, turning the legislature blue. It also worked closely with progressives in other states, most notably Wisconsin, which elected WFP member Mandela Barnes to be its lieutenant governor. The WFP's decision to jump into the primary race now, when so many other energetic liberal groups -- and most major unions -- have chosen to wait and see how the Warren-Sanders race-within-a-race plays out, sent sparks flying within the left's online forums. Like Mitchell, Joe Dinkin, the WFP campaigns director, lauded both Warren and Sanders as transformative progressive leaders, but said the party wanted to get more deeply involved in the primary.   ""We felt like the WFP couldn't sit on the sidelines,"" Dinkin told CNN. ""The right wing, the corporate forces in the Democratic Party, they're all getting organized. So we had to, too, (so) we created a process for our party to make a decision and we're thrilled to stand with Warren and work to build her grassroots army."" The WFP endorsement process played over a number of weeks as a handful of candidates sat down for live-streamed interviews. In addition to Warren and Sanders, former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julián Castro, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio all actively sought their endorsement. "
"LAS VEGAS — Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a $2.5 trillion housing policy plan on Saturday that would include ending homelessness and limiting rent increases across the country by imposing a national rent control standard. Mr. Sanders said that over the next decade, his plan would expand public housing, increase the availability of affordable housing and cap annual rent increases nationally, regardless of income, at no more than one and a half times the rate of inflation or 3 percent, whichever is higher. His campaign said he would be releasing his full plan within the next month. “We have an affordable housing crisis in Nevada, in Vermont and all over this country that must be addressed,” he told an audience of about 100 people at a union hall in Las Vegas, which was hit hard by the housing crisis a decade ago. “For too long, this is one of those issues that we just don’t talk about.” This is the second time in the past 15 days that Mr. Sanders’s campaign has teased a policy rollout without releasing an actual proposal. Late last month, the Vermont senator said at a health care-focused event in Florence, S.C., that he planned to introduce legislation that would eliminate all medical debt. His campaign followed his pronouncement with a one-page overview of what the plan would entail, including canceling $81 billion of existing medical debt. The campaign also said at the time that a plan would be released within a month. [ Sign up for our politics newsletter  hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] The series of soft rollouts underscore just how policy focused the Democratic presidential primary has become. Led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, the field has been introducing policy plans at a pace that at times has been frenetic. Mr. Sanders has long advocated for affordable housing, even during his days as mayor of Burlington, Vt., in the 1980s. But though he suggested housing was not a front-burner topic for many politicians, other 2020 candidates have also introduced housing policies. Ms. Warren and Julián Castro, the former housing secretary under President Barack Obama, have already released their own housing proposals. Senator Kamala Harris has also introduced a bill that would allow overburdened renters to access a sliding tax credit based on factors like income and cost of rent. Mr. Sanders said he would pay for the plan by instituting a wealth tax on the top one-tenth of 1 percent of American households, or about 175,000 households, but provided little else in the way of specific details. During his address, part of a weekend swing through Nevada that also featured a rally at the University of Nevada, Reno, on Friday, Mr. Sanders also attacked President Trump and attempted to draw a contrast between his childhood and the president’s more privileged upbringing. “Unlike Donald Trump, I did not grow up in a wealthy family or live in some fancy house,” he said, a thought he has expressed before. In a rare occurrence, Mr. Sanders also mentioned his mother during his address, saying she had always wanted to move out of the three-and-a-half room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, where they lived when he was a boy. “My mother’s dream was that someday we would move out of that rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn and we would own a home of our own,” he said. “My mother died young, and her dream was never fulfilled. But during her life, at least our family was always able to afford a roof over our heads, because we were living in a rent-controlled building, which meant that for our family and all the other families in our building, rents could not be arbitrarily raised.” [ Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week? ] As with many of his proposals, Mr. Sanders acknowledged that the cost of his housing plan would be steep. “I have no doubt that within five minutes after this speech is made public, my critics will be jumping up and down as is usually the case and they will tell you that the plan that I am releasing is expensive,” he said. “And the truth is it is expensive.” Mr. Sanders also promised to commit $32 billion over five years to end homelessness, and provide outreach services for people experiencing chronic homelessness. He did not say how he would end it; his campaign said more details would be in his full proposal. Astead W. Herndon contributed reporting from New York. "
"Campaign Trail Mix: Elizabeth Warren makes her appeal to older voters with Social Security expansion plan and Sen. Ted Cruz accepts a charity basketball challenge from Andrew Yang. Saying that it’s “time to close and padlock the revolving door between government and industry,” Democratic presidential candidate  Sen. Elizabeth Warren  on Monday unveiled a wide-ranging and detailed plan to crack down on corruption in government. The need for stricter ethics laws has long been a central theme of the  Massachusetts Democrat’s  White House bid, and Warren has repeatedly said it would be her first legislative priority if she wins the presidential election. In announcing her plan,  Warren called it “the most sweeping set of anti-corruption reforms since Watergate.” BERNIE SANDERS SHAKES UP CAMPAIGN LEADERSHIP IN CRUCIAL PRIMARY STATE The senator has emphasized on the campaign trail that she blames the entrenched culture of lobbying in the nation’s capital and the flood of big money into politics for grinding to a halt any potential progress to pass legislation on such top issues as gun violence, climate change and out-of-control health care costs. Among other things, her set of proposals would ban federal lawmakers and the top congressional staffers from serving on corporate boards and would mandate that every new member of Congress make public any potential financial conflicts before taking office. The plan also calls for corporate lobbyists to wait six years before being able to take federal government jobs. And it would permanently prevent the president, vice president, cabinet officials, and federal judges from working as lobbyists after leaving office or the bench. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN To ""end lobbying as we know it,"" Warren would broaden the definition of lobbying and would ban them from working on behalf of foreign governments. And domestically she would prevent them from making political contributions, acting as ""bundlers"" – where they pool donations from multiple people – and hosting fundraisers for candidates. In introducing her plan, Warren highlighted the deterioration of public confidence in government. “In 2019, just 17% of Americans trusted government to do the right thing. Why? Because our government works great for the wealthy and well-connected, but not for everyone else. That’s corruption, plain and simple—and I’ve got a plan to fight back,” she tweeted. As she’s done in the past, Warren specifically took aim at President Trump and his administration, saying “make no mistake about it: The Trump Administration is the most corrupt administration of our lifetimes.” Warren proposed creating a new U.S. Office of Public Integrity – which would investigate ethics complaints from the public and impose penalties on violators or refer “egregious violations to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.” Warren unwrapped her anti-corruption proposals hours ahead of a rally and speech Monday evening at New York City’s Washington Square Park – which is close to the site of the infamous 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. The industrial disaster, in which nearly 150 people were killed, led to the passage of groundbreaking workplace safety regulations. Monday’s speech will likely touch on many of the same themes the populist senator spotlighted during  her formal campaign kickoff in February  in front of historic textile mill buildings in the working-class city of Lawrence, Mass., that were the site of a famous labor strike in 1912. The Warren campaign confirmed that the candidate will use a teleprompter for her Monday evening speech, which she rarely uses on the campaign trail."
"The book, ""The Education of Brett Kavanaugh,"" also details the allegations from Deborah Ramirez, another Yale classmate, and raises new questions about the actions of senators and the FBI before Kavanaugh was confirmed last October. Kavanaugh has publicly denied all allegations against him. Through a Supreme Court spokesperson, he has declined to comment on the book. CNN purchased a copy of the book ahead of its official release. Here are five takeaways: What did the FBI do -- or not do? At the heart of the book's impact is the idea that allegations against Kavanaugh were not thoroughly investigated as the GOP-led Senate worked quickly to confirm him. After the hearings in which Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault during their high school years, and Kavanaugh's fiery denials, Republicans were ready to push through the nomination. Eventually, the FBI was asked to take a week and look into the allegations against Kavanaugh. Democrats at the time complained the investigation was limited, and Pogrebin and Kelly seem to concur. Several people wanted to speak to the FBI or Senate Judiciary Committee about an incident at Yale involving Kavanaugh and Ramirez, in which he allegedly exposed his penis at a party. One former Kavanaugh schoolmate, Mark Krasberg, ""contacted three different Senate offices, an FBI field office, and the Senate Judiciary Committee in order to convey his information, but he was passed around, cut short, or ignored until the final hours of the inquiry on October 5,"" the book states. Fellow former Yale student Ken Appold reported a similar issue, ""being passed around from email to an 800 number to an online form,"" and never heard from the FBI. ""I wasn't surprised; the investigative powers of the FBI were too limited. It wasn't part of their mandate to do more than was absolutely necessary,"" Appold said, according to the book. ""If they had interviewed me, I would have been happy to cooperate."" A third Yale classmate, Kathleen Charlton, ""also tried in vain to reach the FBI,"" the authors write. The FBI declined to comment on the book to CNN. A new incident The offices of at least two senators on the Judiciary Committee learned that a Kavanaugh classmate, Max Stier, had witnessed Kavanaugh engage in a similar incident to the Ramirez allegations. ""Stier relayed his recollections to senators during the confirmation process and later made clear his willingness to share them with the FBI, but he refused to speak about them publicly,"" the book states. It is unclear how much the FBI looked into the incident, if at all. On October 2, 2018, Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons asked the FBI to speak to more people, and singled out Stier, CNN reported. ""The story made its way to the FBI but was never investigated,"" the book states. CNN is not reporting details of the accusation and has not independently corroborated the account. The female victim declined to be interviewed by the book's authors, and her friends told the authors she does not recall the incident.  Stier declined a request to comment from CNN.  Keyser couldn't recall alleged Ford incident The book provides extended quotes from Leyland Keyser, the woman whom Ford told senators attended a ""small gathering"" at a Maryland house on the night of the alleged incident with Kavanaugh.  Before last year's hearings, a lawyer for Keyser said in a statement that his client had ""no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering when (Kavanaugh) was present, with , or without, Dr. Ford.""  At the hearing itself, Ford testified that Keyser has ""significant health challenges"" that she was glad that ""she's taking care of herself."" Ford told the senators that she didn't expect Leland would remember the evening, saying, ""It was a very unremarkable party.""  The authors note in the book that, since high school, Keyser ""had been derailed by a multitude of ailments, undergoing numerous back surgeries, a knee replacement, and other treatments, leaving her unable to work. A Mayo Clinic chronic-pain program helped, but she still had many bad days."" In the book, Keyser is quoted as saying that after a second meeting with FBI agents her ""overall posture"" toward Ford's account was that ""I just really didn't have confidence in the story.""  According to the book, she had had ""second thoughts"" since her initial interview four days earlier with the FBI when she said she couldn't recall the event Ford described.  ""The more Keyser thought about it, the more dubious she was about Ford's account,"" the book states, noting that aspects ""didn't ring true to her."" Those included that she didn't remember hanging out with people who went to Georgetown Prep, ""as much as my friends think"" and that even after reviewing pictures ""she did not know Kavanaugh.""   The book says that Keyser gave investigators her ""whole history of using."" ""I told the FBI about myself,"" she said, ""basically everything I've ever done in my life.""   According to the book Keyser said that she had ""her own history with drugs and alcohol"" but that she was not a ""heavy drinker at that point in high school.""  Keyser told the authors about Ford: ""I think something happened, but I don't know what. And I haven't been close enough to her over the years to know that something went down. I haven't seen her in a long, long time. I do think that something happened to her, and that maybe she is a victim of some sort of trauma.""  But Keyser ""holds firm to her lack of confidence in the specifics of the Kavanaugh account: 'Those facts together I don't recollect, and it just didn't make any sense.'""   The book notes that ""months after Kavanaugh was already sitting on the court, a copy of a National Review article on his confirmation hung, framed in Keyser's bathroom. Dated October 8, 2018, it bore the headline ""Was Leyland Keyser the Hero of the Kavanaugh Controversy?""   Pogrebin and Kelly say that Keyser continued to appear perturbed by her unexpected role in the confirmation battle several months later. In a text message to one of the authors in March 2019, Keyser said that ""she believed she was being surveilled at home, possibly by people related to the Kavanaugh matter."" Ramirez's story Ramirez was the second person, after Ford, to publicly raise allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh. The former Yale student's account was first published by The New Yorker last September, and Ramirez goes into additional detail in the new book about the incident in a dorm common area.  ""During the drinking game, Ramirez said the guys kept picking her to drink more, and she became inebriated. At one point, someone strapped on a fake penis and pointed it at her,"" the book states.   ""Then, later, Ramirez said, she had a penis thrust in her face. She remembered pushing it away, saying, 'That's not a real penis.' But this penis was real, she would recall; she had accidentally touched one for the first time,"" the book adds. ""It was something she hadn't planned to do until she was married."" Ramirez says she remembered ""Kavanaugh pulling up his pants, looking puffed up, like he just did something really, really great,"" and laughing. Another student yelled down the hall: ""Brett Kavanaugh just put his penis in Debbie's face."" When the story was made public last year, Kavanaugh said: ""This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen. The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. This is a smear, plain and simple."" Fellow former Yale student Appold said, however, that people at the time were talking about the incident, recalling that another student said he had witnessed it.  The Kavanaugh fight will never truly end The book is a chance for everyone to relitigate the Kavanaugh nomination. The deep feelings from the hearing have not gone away and likely will never go away for good. ""By allowing no possibility that he had ever assaulted anyone, including Ford, or exposed his penis to Ramirez, Kavanaugh may have boxed himself into a lie,"" Pogrebin and Kelly write. ""But that's the case only if he knowingly uttered a falsehood by denying events he actually did remember. If he genuinely has no recollection of them, and no document, friend, or other evidence surfaced, he was not consciously being dishonest."" Liberals, still stinging from the confirmation of Kavanaugh to replace centrist conservative Anthony Kennedy -- the swing vote on issues such as abortion and race on the Supreme Court -- see additional alleged details of his behavior at Yale as evidence he never should have been confirmed. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nomination frontrunner, said the story raises ""profoundly troubling questions about the integrity of the confirmation process that put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court in the first place.""  Other Democratic contenders -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Kamala Harris, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg called for Kavanaugh to be impeached.   President Donald Trump tweeted that Kavanaugh ""should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department  should come to his rescue."" For the President, the Kavanaugh hearings and close vote last year served as a political boon to get Republicans to turn out in tight Senate races in red states and defeat Democratic incumbents -- actually increasing the GOP's Senate margin from 51 to 53. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said that ""leading Democrats have tried to grab on to yet another poorly sourced, thinly reported, unsubstantiated allegation against Justice Brett Kavanaugh.""

(END VIDEOTAPE) HEMMER: And hello again from Fox News in Washington. We begin with the drone attacks on key Saudi Arabian oil facilities, raising concerns about the global oil supply and world energy prices. Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen claiming responsibility, but President Trump's top diplomat, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, placing the blame squarely on Iran. In a moment, we'll speak exclusively with White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. But, first, the latest from Kevin Corke, who's live in the north lawn of the White House with us on this Sunday -- Kevin. KEVIN CORKE, CORRESPONDENT: Bill, the president said after those attacks, he spoke with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salma, he offered U.S. support, and vowed that America would keep oil markets stable and well-supplied, reassuring words from Washington amid an unfolding drama half a world away. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CORKE: Its aftermath could be seen for miles as Yemeni Houthi rebels took credit for knocking out more than half of Saudi Arabia's oil output over the weekend. Despite the group's claim, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran, writing on Twitter that there was no evidence of the attacks came from Yemen. Iran's foreign minister shot back. Javed Zarif tweeting: Having failed at max pressure, Secretary Pompeo is turning to max deceit. And a Revolutionary Guard commander saying American bases and aircraft carriers in the region are within range of Iranian missiles. The attack stoking fears that tensions between Washington and Tehran have now reached their highest levels since the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979 and comes just days ahead of a gathering of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York and a possible meeting between President Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, and a meeting that would have seemed far less likely before the sudden departure this week of former national security advisor John Bolton whose hawkish tendencies were believed to be frequently at odds with President Trump's own sensibilities. Among those said to be on the long list of possible replacement, top hostage negotiator Robert O'Brien, special envoy for Iran, Ryan Hook, and German Ambassador Ric Grenell, who attended a White House dinner last night with the family of Otto Warmbier, the American college student who died in 2017 after being held captive in North Korea for more than a year. (END VIDEOTAPE) CORKE: Bill, the White House hasn't set what prompted that dinner, although publicly the Warmbier family previously was critical at the president's suggestion that North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un was unaware of Warmbier's deteriorating condition -- Bill. HEMMER: Kevin Corke reporting from the White House -- Kevin, thank you. Joining us now, counsel to the president, Kellyanne Conway. And welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday"". KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Good morning, Bill, to you and your viewers. Thank you. HEMMER: We have a lot to get through. Let's see how much we can cover the next 10 minutes. First on Iran. That the administration believes Iran is responsible. What are you willing to do about it? CONWAY: Secretary Pompeo's made clear that the Iranian regime is responsible for this attack on civilian areas and infrastructure vital to our global energy supply, and we're not going to stand for that. In fact, our Department of Energy stands ready to tap into the strategic reserve, the petroleum reserve, if we must, to stabilize the global energy supply. But more importantly, Secretary Pompeo and Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin just this last week stood in the White House press briefing room and announced additional sanctions, and that is because we will continue to call out maligned behavior, continue with the maximum pressure campaign in Iran, and this is a president who withdrew us from a very bad nuclear deal with a ne'er-do-well regime. So, this president also, through his energy policy, Bill, has made us less dependent on these foreign dictators and bad regimes for energy supply. We now in the U.S. are net exporters of natural gas and oil at the highest levels this country has ever seen and that will continue. People always complained here (ph), nothing is made in the U.S. anymore. Of course, that's changing under President Trump. But we have energy under our feet and off of our shores. HEMMER: OK. Let me -- CONWAY: And this president is leading the way to responsibly develop it so that when Iran attacks Saudi Arabia, as it has over 100 times, we are prepared to take action to -- (CROSSTALK) HEMMER: OK. We have a few -- a few specific questions. Senator Lindsey Graham says you can -- should consider attacking Iran's oil fields. Is that a consideration? CONWAY: Well, you know, this president and his national security team and Secretary Pompeo, our nation's chief diplomat, keep many options on the table, particularly when it comes to retaliating against maligned behavior and protecting American interests and Americans, and our American economy. So, I won't get ahead of Secretary Pompeo and the president in saying that. But this is why it's so important to have a president who isn't a typical politician because he and his team don't sit around and say, well, let's study it, let's have a competition about it. Secretary Pompeo went right out there, and pointed the finger at the aggressor here, the Iranian regime. Others are trying to deflect the responsibility. But I think Kevin Corke's reports from the White House is important, when he says it's probably the most aggressive action in the 40-year -- last 40 years between Iran and the U.S. But that started because this president inherited a bad deal, bad nuclear deal where we shoveled over cash for really nothing, and he took us out of that deal. And I think that shocked many people who just figure whoever the president is, Republican or Democrat, just goes along to get along, doesn't keep those campaign promises. And that was a big one for this president. So, we would continue to -- (CROSSTALK) HEMMER: Yes, understood on that. He also said -- CONWAY: -- talk to Iran when we need to. HEMMER: Yes, he also -- CONWAY: Yes. HEMMER: -- talk to Iran is the next question on that, because just this past week, he suggested twice that he is willing to meet with the Iranian leader in New York City two weeks from now. Does he still want that meeting? CONWAY: He said he'll consider it and he -- conditions also always must be right for this president to make a deal or take a meeting. We see that. We see that with the trade agenda. I think an expedient president would have already had a so-so, half-baked deal with China, and to get him through the next election. But that's not the way President Trump thinks. He's patient. He waits for the deal. That's a benefit of having a businessman in the White House. He also knows that you don't sit down and meet with people unless you have all of these other accoutrements around the new (ph) relationship like the maximum pressure campaign, like pulling of the Iranian nuclear deal, like the secretary of treasury and secretary of state just days ago, Bill, from the White House announcing new sanctions. So, all of that is still in play whether or not the president includes Iran in one of his meetings. I've seen a plenary agenda. He's very busy, obviously, doing a lot of bilateral meetings, making address to the United Nations and indeed to the world. So, we'll see what happens. But this would not have -- (CROSSTALK) HEMMER: So, just to cut through (ph) with that, a meeting -- CONWAY: Attacking Saudi Arabia -- HEMMER: A meeting is still on the table, correct? CONWAY: Well, the president can sit -- well, the president will always consider his options. And he's never -- we've never committed to that meeting at the United Nations General Assembly. The president just said he's looking at it. So, I'll -- I'll allow the president to announce a meeting or a non-meeting. But when you attack Saudi Arabia, and as the secretary of state has noted, they've attacked them dozens and dozen times, you attack civilian areas, critical infrastructure to indeed the world (ph) -- the global economy, global energy stability, you're not helping your case much. HEMMER: Last point on this. What would you expect from that meeting if it were to happen? CONWAY: Well, I don't engage in hypotheticals like that, though. But you've seen a president who is willing to take meetings with any number of world leaders, because he believes as he has said many times, if we can bring peace and prosperity, protect the peace and prosperity of our nation, but bring it to other hotspots around the world, he's going to do that. Why bother being the president of the United State -- if you're Donald Trump, why bother giving up the great life he had, the very successful life he had outside of government for 70 years, and if you're not going to engage, if you're not going to do things differently, if you're not going to try to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, if you're not going to try to meet with other folks to get better deals? He's renegotiating these bad trade deals all across the world for similar reasons. He thinks Americans and American interests and American workers have been screwed for far too long by people on both sides of the aisle, by typical politicians worried about the next election and not worried about your next paycheck. HEMMER: OK. John Bolton this week is gone. There's a job opening in the West Wing. Here's how the president described his management style just three days ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: A lot of people want the job. And we -- it's a great job. It's great because it's a lot of fun to work with Donald Trump and it's very easy actually to work with me. You know why it's easy? Because I make all the decisions. They don't have to work. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEMMER: We know he is confident, but with the level of turnover, does he have enough of a team around him, Kellyanne? CONWAY: He does, indeed. And I've heard these stories again and again from day one. I've been there from day one. And the fact is what the president just described is part of the transparency and accountability that he allows himself as president and commander-in-chief every single day. We've never had a president so accessible to the press and indeed the public, Bill, in an ongoing basis. He engages in social media regularly. He gives these press avails. And what he said there is exactly right. But this -- but let me walk back a couple. Before the president makes a decision, I can tell you as someone who is in here daily in front of him, he invites dissenting opinion. He enjoys -- he not just accepts, he expects disagreement and diversity of viewpoints. I see any number of issues, including national security and foreign policy, and then he weighs consequences, hears everybody out, reads the paper -- reads the briefing papers, thinks about it, meets two different teams, and then he makes the decision. You know why? Because in the entire West Wing, actually in the entire Trump-Pence administration, only two people were elected to anything and their names are Donald J. Trump and Michael R. Pence. So, we are there to give our counsel and put out all the consequences, and I think the president is also a great reader when people have personal agendas, when they're not thinking about the American interest. They're thinking of their own personal interest. (CROSSTALK) HEMMER: Did John Bolton -- did John Bolton have a -- CONWAY: I don't think many of them had survived -- a lot of them can get through the door. (CROSSTALK) HEMMER: Was John Bolton in that category? CONWAY: No, no, that's not -- that's not a comment about him. No, that is not a comment about ambassador -- (CROSSTALK) HEMMER: When will we get an answer as to -- CONWAY: -- thanked for his service. HEMMER: Yes, when do we get an answer on who replaces John Bolton? (CROSSTALK) CONWAY: John Bolton and Donald Trump were aligned on many different issues. Maybe as soon as this week or the next week. The president is engaging with, interviewing -- indeed, actually interviewing a number of highly qualified candidates for that position. And it is the president's agenda, his foreign policy, national security beliefs, which will go forward. And I would point you to the president's speech about Afghanistan in August of 2017, eight months into his presidency or so, where he said, this will not be the policies of the last couple of presidents. We're going to look at conditions on the ground, not have some false timetable that we publish for the world to see. So, this president has been out there. He introduced his international security strategy a while ago and he thanked Ambassador Bolton for his service as I do. People who want to serve at the levels -- on behalf of our country at that level, and take an oath to the Constitution should be applauded. HEMMER: OK. CONWAY: And not derided by large swaths of the American people. HEMMER: On gun control now. The president wrote this on Twitter back in August. He said: Serious discussions are taking place between House and Senate leadership on meaningful background checks. I'm the biggest Second Amendment person there is. Common sense things can be done that are good for everyone. Then, three days ago, he was asked whether or not he would support expanded commercial background checks. And this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: If this is a movement by the Democrats to take your guns away, then it's never going to happen because we're never going to let that happen. We will always be there for our Second Amendment. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEMMER: So, Mitch McConnell says he wants to know what the president will support. Has he made a decision on that? CONWAY: The president has been actively engaged on the Second Amendment issue the entire time, particularly after the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, and then, of course, Odessa after that. And he has talked -- just this week, I was there. He talked to Republican and Democratic United States senators who also were actively engaged. We want this to be bipartisan but we're not going to allow bad actors who should not have firearms in the first place who then a murder innocent Americans to be the excuse that a bunch of liberals and socialists have to confiscate firearms from law-abiding citizens who have legally procured them. And I'm not going to allow people who are constantly maligning and the deriding our law enforcement to be in charge of public safety, public policy. And so, when Leader McConnell says he wants to put on the Senate floor something the president will support, that's advice (ph). So why are the Democrats talking about things that President Obama didn't support? (CXROSSTALK) HEMMER: I just -- I don't hear support for a specific piece of legislation. Does that mean the decision has not yet been made? CONWAY: There is (ph). Well, there are pieces of legislation that already exists that we have looked at. The president has been briefed on. Many of my colleagues in the West Wing missed their summer vacation. They have working on this every single day. We met with the president several times just this past week. He has been talking to members who will vote on this, on both sides of the aisle. And he wants to do something all at once. The president has been listening to the best practices in the states that have risk protection orders. He's been listening to strengthening mental health. He's been listening -- he has done more on background checks than any other president in this way, any other recent president in this way. In March of 2018, Bill, President Trump signed into law the Fix NICS. That would have prevented a number of these murderers from having firearms in the first place. Senator Coons, a Democrat of Delaware, Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican of Pennsylvania, they've got Fix NICS Plus, we call it ""Lie-and-Try"". If you even try to get a firearm and you shouldn't be, you're already on a list. That gets reported to the authorities. (CROSSTALK) HEMMER: So, what I'm hearing is that -- CONWAY: Bill, I want to look America's -- I want to look America's other mothers in the face and tell them that we need to look at the fact patterns that happened in places like Parkland, Florida, and Dayton, Ohio, and together, we're all scratching our heads and say, how can this happen? So, we have to look at what has happened and fix that for the next time. Not just pass bills willy-nilly, because the government -- the Democrats like Beto O'Rourke admitted it the other night, we're coming for your guns. (CROSSTALK) HEMMER: We will get to that a bit later. CONWAY: -- Senate unsuccessful in Texas. HEMMER: Yes, I don't mean to interject but -- CONWAY: But there are a number of pieces of legislation the president is considering. HEMMER: I get it. I've got two minutes left. CONWAY: Something else, ""Lie-and-Try"". HEMMER: Yes, I get it, quick lightning round. A little bit delay on the set (ph) out here. My apologies. On China trade, Beijing gave a little this week, we gave a little. Are we fighting to a stalemate on this issue? Yes or no? CONWAY: No. We're getting to a great trade agreement that stops screwing the American worker and American economy. Why do we have a $500 billion trade deficit with China, the world's second-largest economy? Why have we as America just sat idly by and look to the way, where they've been forcing technology transfers and stealing our intellectual property? So, this president doesn't make a quick, half-baked deal when he can get a better deal longer term. HEMMER: OK, I said lightning round. CONWAY: And I think it's a positive progress that the Chinese are coming to America, the Chinese are coming here now and the president wants a bilateral trade agreement that helps Americans. HEMMER: Two more things, one minute left here. On impeachment, what does he think about those in the House pursuing it? CONWAY: Complete nonsense. Even Jerry Nadler said, oh, impeachment is just a term. This is a process. They can't even -- they need to get a messaging meeting and they need to read the Constitution of the Democratic Party. HEMMER: We saw -- CONWAY: Americans, the Congress work for you. They work for you. And they're wasting your money and their time on trying to impeach a president where there are no high crimes and misdemeanors. They thought the Mueller report would be the end-all. They even had Bob Mueller come and talk about the Mueller report and it was a disaster. So, they work for you. Tell them to vote on the USMCA, get that trade deal done. Tell them drug pricing, infrastructure, keep this great economy humming along, and stop the nonsense of harassing and embarrassing this president and the people around him when you've had no constitutional or legal basis to do so. HEMMER: Last point. He said, it's Biden, Warren or Sanders. Does he still think that for the Democratic nomination? CONWAY: Sure. Well, anything can happen, we saw that in 2016. Although at this point in 2016, President Trump was the front runner, had center stage in the debates, never lost that place, and is now the president. Sure. But I think it's -- the ironies should be lost on no one, that the Democratic Party, Bill, that has said, we are for -- we need a new generation of leadership, they have candidates of color. They have female -- they have female candidates of color. They have -- they've got -- so, they have young candidates, young, up-and-coming candidates. But is it lost on anyone that the three front runners are sort of older white candidates? I think that's pretty ironic because that's the Democratic primary electorate who is rejecting these younger candidates in this, quote, generational transformation. Donald Trump can beat any of them. You hear in debate after debate, people creeping toward socialism. Folks, wake up already. People are fleeing (ph) socialist countries to come to our great democracy of capitalism and freedom. Our girls and women have rights in this country. Socialists has impoverished millions of people -- HEMMER: All right. CONWAY: -- and taking even worse from them. So, this president is ready for any of them. HEMMER: OK. CONWAY: I think he's watching with more amusement and very little fear. HEMMER: I'll leave it there but thank you for your time. We'll work on the lightning aspect next time. Kellyanne Conway, I appreciate you being with us today. Thank -- CONWAY: Bill, thank you. HEMMER: Thank you. In a moment, Democratic presidential candidates came to the debate stage spoiling for a fight, and they got one. We'll ask our Sunday group whether anyone move the needle, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE BUTTIGIEG, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington, scoring points against each other, poking at each other, and telling each other that -- my plan, your plan. Look, we all have different visions for what is better -- CASTRO: Yes, that's called the Democratic primary election, Pete. That's called an election. (APPLAUSE) That's an election, you know? This is what we're here for. It's an election. SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, D-MINN., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, but a house -- a house divided cannot stand. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEMMER: 2020 Democrats there on stage in Houston on Thursday night, laying out the risk of going after one another. Time now for our Sunday group. Josh Holmes, former chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell; Neera Tanden, president and CEO for the Center of American Progress, Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for ""The Wall Street Journal""; and Townhall.com editor, Katie Pavlich. Welcome to all of you in this Sunday, and thank you for being here. On Thursday morning, the ""A.P."" summarized the debate from Thursday the following way: Nine months into the nomination fight, divided Democrats have yet to answer fundamental questions about who or what the party stands for beyond simply opposing President Donald Trump. Neera, I'll start with you. You've had three days to think about it. What do you think about that? (LAUGHTER) NEERA TANDEN, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: I actually think that was false. I think that the debate on Thursday really shows different visions. Obviously, it is a robust primary debate. But there are various visions about how to move the country forward on health care. Everyone, of course, opposes President Trump's effort to eliminate health care for 20 million people, but they have different visions about how to expand health care and get health care to the rest of Americans. So, I actually thought -- and there are various views on climate. But there are -- that's what a primary debate is for. But every one -- I mean, very single one of those candidates is offering ideas and agendas about how to move the country forward -- HEMMER: OK. TANDEN: -- past the Trump election (ph). HEMMER: Did Thursday night, Katie, move anything in terms of the race itself? Did it change anything? KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM EDITOR: I don't think it changed much in terms of who is going to be the front runner. I do think that Joe Biden is going to have to come up with more of a platform than just relying on his work with President Obama and come up with some real policy points that he can articulate against someone like Elizabeth Warren, who was gaining on him. But we did learn, I agree, we did learn a lot about what Democrats stand for in this debate and others. They stand for eliminating health insurance for 140 million people, by eliminating private service to Bernie Sander's legislation, which was pointed out in the pages, makes private health insurance illegal. We know that Democrats want to spend a lot more money when it comes to implementing socialist programs and the government takeover of a number of industries. They want to eliminate fossil fuels in the next 20 years, which will also cost the economy billions of dollars. And one thing also that we learned that was to President Trump's credit, is that when it came to the economy, no questions were directly asked about the economy, but they did get that topic through the issue of trade. Not a single Democrat on the stage advocated for the repeal of the tariffs that the president has put on China, which means they don't have a different approach, and again, it's going to be different for them to come -- (CROSSTALK) HEMMER: I know you're -- TANDEN: I just have to respond very quickly to this. On each of these charges -- every single person there on that stage is trying to get more people covered than like President Trump who is trying to get less people covered. Even on -- PAVLICH: By making private insurance illegal. TANDEN: That issue of private insurance is a robust debate in the Democratic Party. (CROSSTALK) HEMMER: OK, I wish -- TANDEN: I just need to say, many of those candidates didn't support and many oppose him on trade. HEMMER: I wish we have three hours like they did on Thursday night. I just -- one of the moments that's been talked about -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Asking for fairness, that's all. HEMMER: -- one of the moments that was talked about the most, Julian Castro said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CASTRO: Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? I can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in. And now you're saying they don't have to -- you're forgetting that. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEMMER: Is that fair game, Josh? JOSH HOLMES, FORMER MCCONNELL CHIEF OF STAFF: Well, look, it ended up to be a little bit of a cheap shot, but Castro is obviously trying to capitalize on Vice President Biden's biggest liability which is most Democratic voters at this point don't know whether to cast the ballot for him or call in a Silver Alert because I -- more than not on stage, he seems unsteady. Now, I think he was better in this debate than he was in the first two. But there is time and time again where the former vice president is a little unsteady and Castro is clearly trying to make an issue of that. HEMMER: Toward the end of Thursday night, this happened in one of the closing statements. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's not they don't want to help. They don't want -- they don't know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television -- excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the phone -- make sure that kids hear words. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEMMER: Hard to overlook that, Catherine. CATHERLINE LUCY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes. I'd note, the record player comment is I think attracted a lot of attention. I'm not sure that my kids have ever seen a record player. But, I mean, more broadly, I think that answer has raised questions and conversations about the muddled answers that the vice president has given at times in these debates. Although in this debate, at many moments, he did turn in a stronger performance than other nights. But I think also he pulled back more broadly. One thing to think about with the vice president is that despite a lot of questions about debate performance, some gaffes, you know, his age, he has remained atop the polls and his lead has stayed pretty durable. So, it's not clear at this point sort of heading into the last stretch before we start seeing voting in Iowa and New Hampshire, to what will change. HEMMER: I want to bring you all in a moment here, but at the risk of piling on, there was this moment of what appeared to be a confusion also on Thursday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: It cannot be put together. Let me say it again. It will not be put together. The three different countries -- Pakistan owns the three counties -- the three provinces in the east. There are not any part of the (INAUDIBLE) run it. I will go on and on. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEMMER: So, it's a confusing matter because he mixed up Iraq and Afghanistan. He's been proponent of dividing Iraq in three actually for a better part of 20 years, Neera. TANDEN: Yes, I have to say, I think -- I think most Democratic primary voters, which is who's looking at right now, don't compare Joe Biden to other Democrats on some of these issues. They compare him to Donald Trump, who to a lot of the country seems pretty gaffe-prone a lot of the time. So I think for Democratic primary voters, the idea that you're mixing up the words country and province, or county and province, versus the kinds of things that we see from Donald Trump on a regular basis, where he mixes up words -- I laughed. HEMMER: I asked Katie -- do you think Thursday changed anything, yes or no? TANDEN: I think actually the middle tier candidates did very well for Democratic primary voters, Cory, Kamala, Klobuchar, Beto, and I think they may rise. I'm not sure it did anything to eliminate Joe Biden's support. HEMMER: Another debate in October. Katie, go ahead. PAVLICH: Correct, but if you're going to compare Joe Biden to Donald Trump, which is something obviously, a few months of nomination, we will be looking at, Joe Biden's big selling point is that he knows what he's doing. He's been in Washington for over 30 years. He has experience, and yet he's not showing that when he confuses these answers on the campaign trail. And I just want to get back to the record player comment. On the surface level, it's kind of funny to think that this is about age, and he's just not with the hip new technology we have, but really his answer was -- he was asked what you do about minority communities and school choice. And his bigotry of low expectations answer on that was to have social workers from the government come into the homes of minority and poor families and tell them how to raise their children by playing the record player, he's going to have a better answer than that for -- for parents who want to send their -- who want to send their kids to better schools. NEERA TANDEN, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: I am so sorry. I am so sorry. I really have to get it on this. I have to say this. I have to say, and I think -- I think a lot of people, not just Democrats, look at these answers and say it's ridiculous. You have a president who attacks people of color regularly. He has been -- regularly via tweet. He goes to rallies where people say send her back. HEMMER: Well, I know, Sam, the point -- PAVLICH: (INAUDIBLE) -- HEMMER: Neera, hang on, allow her to -- allow her to respond. TANDEN: I know, but I just need to say, on what standard are you judging Vice President Biden when you will not say one word against Donald Trump? PAVLICH: On the standard of -- of his -- on -- on the stand of his own words. TANDEN: One word. PAVLICH: And President Trump actually believes in going into minority communities, doing criminal justice reform, allowing -- TANDEN: Come on. PAVLICH: Parents of -- of -- of children to choose schools of their choice and (INAUDIBLE) -- TANDEN: Uh-huh. And he also believes in attacking members of the (INAUDIBLE) -- HEMMER: Hang on, Neera. As I said it, I wish we had three hours. We don't. Panel, I've got to take a break, OK. See you a bit later in the program here today. In a moment, Democrats struggled to get on the same page on impeachment, even as the Judiciary Committee takes a big step in its ongoing investigation. A key member from that committee will join us live, next (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HEMMER: House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler promising and aggressive series of hearings next week as Democrats decide whether or not to recommend President Trump's impeachment. That's a move group that could put pressure on the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who has taken more of a wait and see approach. With me now, Congressman David Cicilline of Rhode Island, a key member of the Judiciary Committee and House Democratic leadership. And, Congressman, welcome back and “Fox News Sunday.” REP. DAVID CICILLINE, D-R.I.: Thanks. Good to be with you. HEMMER: First, on impeachment. There seemed to be a fair amount of confusion as to what the process was this week. What is your committee trying to accomplish, sir? CICILLINE: Well, I don't -- I don't think there should be any confusion. The Judiciary Committee has been engaged in the world of our committee to determine whether or not to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House. We are looking at obstruction of justice, abuse of power, corruption broadly. We've engaged in hearings. We're going to continue to bring witnesses before the committee, compel the production of documents to make it clear that no one in this country is above the law, including the president of the United States, that he has to be held accountable. We're going to follow the facts where they take us. And at the conclusion of that investigation, make a recommendation to the full House. HEMMER: OK. So then many of the Democratic freshmen are holding back. A lot of them in swing states too. Donna Shalala out of Florida said this, ""it's sucking the air out of all the good stuff that we're doing."" If you're doing good stuff, why go this direction? CICILLINE: Well, yes, I mean Donna's right in one point. Look, we've passed over 250 pieces of the legislation. Legislation should drive down health care costs to protect coverage for pre-existing conditions, to help rebuild the infrastructure of our country, to raise family incomes, to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, to provide equal pay for equal work, universal background checks. We've passed a lot of legislation. Eighty percent of those bills are sitting on Mitch McConnell's desk. So we're getting the word done for the American people, addressing the anxiety, the economic concerns that folks have, driving down the cost of prescription drugs and of health care broadly, raising family incomes, rebuilding the infrastructure of our country. HEMMER: But she says -- CICILLINE: We're getting that done. And, she's right, there's not nearly enough coverage of that. But the real story is, we're doing both things. We're delivering on the promises we made to the American people to make their lives better, and at the same time we're holding the administration accountable. We have to do both. And we -- there's a lot more discussion about the second point, by the media, by -- HEMMER: But she said she had 11 town halls in Florida back in August. And she received a grand total of four questions on this issue. And two of those questions came from the same person. It would not appear that your voters care much about your pursuit. CICILLINE: Well, I think there's no question that voters care about the issues that we're focused on. And, you know, we're trying to protect the Affordable Care Act and protect coverage for pre-existing conditions and drive down the cost of prescription drugs. Our Republican colleagues are doing the opposite. We're trying to raise family incomes by making sure that women have equal pay for equal work (ph), we're raising the minimum wage. But -- HEMMER: But I was asking you about impeachment. CICILLINE: Right. HEMMER: And that word did not even come up during the three hour debate on Thursday night. CICILLINE: No, I -- I think that's right. I think the reality is, the American people expect that those of us who have the privilege in serving government, from the president on down, are acting in the public interest, not in their own self-interest. They want to be sure that people are held accountable. No one is above the law. That if misconduct has happened, that those individuals are held accountable. So they may not talk about it, they may not ask lots of questions about it, but, fundamentally, people want to have confidence that those that are serving in government are acting in their best interest and not in their own financial interests to the benefit of their corporation or their family business. And I think that's why the accountability is critical. We have to do both things. I think the American people elected us to do both things, to deliver on the important priorities in their lives and to make sure government is working for them. HEMMER: OK. On gun control, this happened in Houston on Thursday night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BETO O'ROURKE, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Hell yes we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We're not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans any more. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEMMER: As you know, Democrats are members of the NRA too. How does that message help the current issue? CICILLINE: Well, look, I think that -- that message doesn't help. But the reality is we passed two important gun safety proposals back in February, universal background checks and closing the Charleston loophole. Universal background checks work. Three million gun sales have been prevented because people who are not eligible to buy a gun because of their criminal record, their domestic abuse, their mental health status, went into a gun store and tried to buy a gun and they were denied. So we know background checks work. The problem is, one in five gun sales happens in this country without a background check. So we passed legislation to fix that, to close that loophole. It's been sitting on Mitch McConnell's desk since February. And so first and foremost -- HEMMER: You just said that, that that comments from Beto O'Rourke does not help. And many will say that Democrats are coming for their guns. CICILLINE: Yes, that's just not true. Look, where there's no proposal to do that in the Congress. We have legislation that is designed to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them, to try to prevent people from possessing the most lethal and dangerous weapons of war. That's been our focus. There are dozens of proposals to reduce gun violence. But we have to do something. The American people are demanding that we do something. It is no longer safe to be in synagogues and churches and shopping malls and schools. You know, I grew up and we did fire drills. That was the most scary thing we did. Now young children are doing active shooter drills because they're trying to be taught to prepare for an active shooter in their school. We can't allow this to continue. We have the ability to reduce gun violence, to make certain that people don't get guns who shouldn't have them. Mitch McConnell ought to bring those bills to the floor immediately. HEMMER: OK. CICILLINE: And we're going to send him some more. HEMMER: We -- we will see what realistically that can be signed into law perhaps this week. On Saudi Arabia now you're calling for the U.S. to end its involvement in the conflict between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Do you stand by that given the events that the administration ties directly to Iran over the past 24 hours? CICILLINE: Look, this is -- the war in Yemen has created a humanitarian crisis of epic proportion. There is no question that their recent action by Iran, if Iran is responsible for this bombing, has a -- is an escalation of Iran's, you know, malevolent behavior in the region. But this is made very complicated because the president doesn't appear to have a strategy for dealing with Iran. He ripped up the Iran deal, which was a deal that prevented Iran from becoming a nuclear power, with nothing to replace it. This is a sort of pattern of the president. He rips up a deal, doesn't have anything -- strategy to replace it, hasn't worked with our allies and now we're left with an Iran that is engaging in more dangerous behavior with not a lot of options left for the United States. So I think the president needs to staff up his national security team, he needs his director of national intelligence and a national security advisor in place. He's operating with a very thin team right now. He needs to develop a strategy to box Iran in and work with our allies. But this is a very alarming develop. HEMMER: Some would argue that Iran's been at that for 40 years. Now, quickly, and -- CICILLINE: No questions about it. HEMMER: Yes. You're also involved, this past week, with big tech. And it was announced that big tech is now in the crosshairs of government security in a significant way and that includes Google and FaceBook, Amazon and Apple. Sir, what did they do wrong? CICILLINE: Well, look, we're -- we have launched an investigation. It's a bipartisan investigation of the Judiciary Committee being led by the anti- trust subcommittee to look at the digital marketplace broadly. We have very large technology platforms with enormous market power that are engaged in what appear to be pretty clearly anti-competitive behavior where they're favoring their own products and services, where they're excluding rivals. We want the marketplace to work right so there's real competition. So the next Amazon or the next FaceBook can be born and be successful. And so competition matters because it promotes innovation, it protects consumers, it protects workers, and this concentration is -- HEMMER: OK. And they would argue, yes, that they've led the way in giving consumers choice through their own capitalistic innovation. I think the question is, are you -- CICILLINE: Well, I mean the problem is -- the problem -- HEMMER: Are you -- the question is, sir, are you ready to end that? CICILLINE: No, look, we want to be sure the market is working so there's more competition, there are more competitors, there are more start-ups, more entrepreneurs. Consumers have control over their own data, that their privacy is protected. So this is a marketplace where you have basically people acting like monopolies and what we need to do is make sure that competition is working in that marketplace so that more competitors will enter the market so consumers and workers will be protected. This is a bipartisan investigation. We're studying why the competition doesn't exist in that marketplace -- HEMMER: OK. CICILLINE: And what we can do to get it working properly (INAUDIBLE). HEMMER: David Cicilline, I really appreciate your time on this Sunday morning. Thank you for being here. CICILLINE: My pleasure. HEMMER: Thank you, sir. CICILLINE: In a moment, our Sunday panel comes back to talk about the politics of gun control and impeachment with a divided Congress. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: Don't ask me what we haven't done. We have done it. And if you are (INAUDIBLE) it's my impatience. It's because people are dying. And Senator McConnell hasn't acted. Why don't you go ask him why -- if he has any regrets for all the people who died because she hasn't acted. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEMMER: Strong words. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi this week, blaming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for stalling gun legislation. Back with the panel now. Josh, I'll begin with you. He's your former boss. JOSH HOLMES, FORMER MCCONNELL CHIEF OF STAFF: Yes, I mean, what you saw out of Nancy Pelosi is a fundamentally unserious approach to an extremely serious issue. What she's talking about there is a bill that got a veto statement issued by this White House in February of last year. She's had six months to think about how to get around that and how to work on it if she wants to do something with -- with the issue of guns. She's chosen not to. She's chosen to make it a political issue. In contrast to that, what we've seen out of the White House, and I think Kellyanne spoke about this on the program earlier, is they've taken a three week period to talk to lawmakers like Chris Murphy, one of the most notable, liberal, anti-gun senators in the Senate, to talk about his ideas. Joe Manchin, the author of the Manchin-Toomey background check bill. They've -- they've brought people in to talk about, where is a potential solution that could actually have the votes to pass the Senate, past the House and be signed into law. That should be the exercise we're engaged here. I think -- I don't think there's a parent in America that doesn't have a lot of anxiety over this issue. They should, at the very least, hope that their lawmakers are using this as more than a political punching bag, which is, unfortunately, where the speaker of the House has this. HEMMER: You cover the White House. Is the president ready to announce what he is willing to support? CATHERINE LUCEY, ""THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"": Well, here's what we know. As Josh said, they have been going through this review process. They have looked at a lot of different ideas. They've gone back over previous proposals. There have been a lot of talks with Republican and Democratic lawmakers. And the president was briefed on some of the options that the White House has sort of put together. On Thursday we heard him speak a little bit about that meeting. He hasn't yet committed to what he's going to do. There is a hope that he may sort of roll out some ideas this week. But, really, it's not clear exactly what he's going to get behind and specifically what that will look like with background checks, which is a big question for a lot of people. HEMMER: Yes. I mentioned this Beto O'Rourke thing a bit earlier in our show here. Ted Cruz gave an interview this week, Christian Science Monitor. He said the following. He said, ""if Republicans abandon the Second Amendment and demoralize millions of Americans that care deeply about Second Amendment rights, that could go a long way to electing a president Elizabeth Warren."" He's making the point it's hurting Republicans. Democrats and others are making the point that Beto O'Rourke's comments hurt Democrats. What is it? PAVLICH: Well, Beto O'Rourke's comments also hurt Americans who, you know he's -- he's lying when he says this is a buyback. There's no such thing as a government buyback when it's confiscation and there are serious consequences for not obeying what the government has done. Americans don't buy their guns from the government, so therefore the government cannot buy them back. But in terms of the news actually that got missed last week, Beto O'Rourke saying those things is one thing, and he's just exposing what the left has been wanting to do for decades on gun control. They say they want to do implementary (ph) policies. But the truth is, they really just want bans on a number of firearms that Americans lawfully own and use in this country. But Joe Biden, on Friday, actually did an interview with a local station and said that if he was on the Supreme Court, he would have voted against the Heller decision, which is a big deal considering Heller reinforced the idea that the Second Amendment as an individual right. Now, he's the frontrunner. And so that is something that he's going to have to explain to voters that they are trying to get back in blue states, like Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin. HEMMER: I want to -- I want to get to this issue of impeachment because I know you have some thoughts on this, OK. Doug Collins is the Republican -- TANDEN: I really -- I'm so sorry, I need to respond on guns. HEMMER: One second. I -- one second on that. I really want to get you to react to this, OK? TANDEN: OK. I'll -- I'll respond (INAUDIBLE). HEMMER: Doug Collins on impeachment of the committee this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DOUG COLLINS, R-GA: The Judiciary Committee has became a giant Instagram filter, to make you appear that something's happening that's not. We're so in fantasy land here, nobody knows what's going on. I think -- this is the problem. You just went back to what we said. Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, it doesn't matter, we're not in an impeachment inquiry. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEMMER: We come back to this question whether anything come from this committee on impeachment. Does it? TANDEN: The -- the committee has an invest -- has an impeach -- inquiry into whether to impeach. So, as you saw from what David Cicilline said, they have a number of questions and they have a formal process for that. And an important part of their process is insuring the president's council is part of the process. So -- but I -- I really do just need to respond to a few things that were said here about the issue of guns, because I think this is a central issue for the country. I think it belies any credibility that the president doesn't' t-- isn't -- it's not -- he's not capable of making a decision, and he's not capable of bringing the Senate with him. The president -- all the -- the Senate, Mitch McConnell, Democrats, they all know what the ideas are in front of them and they have those ideas and it's really incumbent on the president and Mitch McConnell to pass a background check bill, which, just for the record, there are people getting through background checks now who are not having background checks who are murdering people. So it's a simple bill to pass. And you -- Josh, you and I both know that the president -- HOLMES: (INAUDIBLE) you know, you want to just take -- take a minute for yourself here. TANDEN: Just to take -- no, just -- there are tweets he does every day. HOLMES: The -- I think the biggest part that Democrats just fundamentally don't understand about this is that there are large swaths of this country that have a cultural identity with the Second Amendment. TANDEN: Sure. HOLMES: Just because that doesn't anchor in New York City or San Francisco doesn't mean that we just have to willy-nilly pass everything. TANDEN: Ninety percent of people support background checks. Ninety percent. HOLMES: This takes a very thoughtful process with the end goal -- TANDEN: Ninety percent. HOLMES: The end goal should be for everyone -- TANDEN: Absolutely. HOLMES: To try to pass something that stops this violence. TANDEN: Absolutely. So -- HOLMES: Which is not where Democrats are (INAUDIBLE). TANDEN: Ninety percent. HEMMER: We will see what comes of this. Pane, thanks to you on the issue of impeachment. Corey Lewandowski is first up Tuesday afternoon before that committee. We'll see what happens then. Thank you. In a moment, our ""Power Player of the Week."" A conversation with Robert Kennedy's oldest child on how his words still resonate in today's political climate. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HEMMER: Political speeches at one time inspiring, soaring rhetoric and calls to meet great challenges in our country. And if you think our national discourse has gotten uglier in the recent years on all sides, well, you're not alone. Here's Chris Wallace with the ""Power Player of the Week."" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATHLEEN KENNEDY TOWNSEND, ROBERT F. KENNEDY'S DAUGHTER: If you're an American, you get involved, you act, you make a difference, you don't stand on the sidelines. CHRIS WALLACE, ANCHOR (voice over): Kathleen Kennedy Townsend on her father's message in his final campaign 51 years ago. ROBERT F. KENNEDY: We are a great country, an unselfish country, and a compassionate country. WALLACE: There's no mistaking -- TOWNSEND: All American shares a common future. WALLACE: She's Robert Kennedy's daughter. WALLACE (on camera): Do you realize, as I listen you talk, and look at your face, that you're the living, breathing embodiment of your dad? TOWNSEND: No. Well, thank you very much. That's sweet of you to say. Language can lift us up. And I think right now is a time that we do need our language lifted up. WALLACE (voice over): Townsend was talking about her father this spring and the relevance of a collection of his most famous speeches called ""RFK: His Words for Our Times."" KENNEDY: Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight in Memphis, Tennessee. WALLACE: Speeches like the one he made April 4, 1968, in Indianapolis, despite warnings from local police. KENNEDY: And we dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago, to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world. TOWNSEND: Here is a man who came from privilege, who quotes the Greeks in an inner-city and calms the crowd. And, in the sense, speaks to the better angels of people's nature and succeeds. WALLACE: Or a speech he made at the University of Mississippi in 1966, hostile territory for the former attorney general who led the fight for civil rights. KENNEDY: It is far easier to accept and to stand on the path than to fight for the answers of the future. TOWNSEND: He was the devil too many people of the University of Mississippi. And it just taught him that if you are honest, if you go to where it's difficult, you can win over hearts and minds. Being in Washington is just so filled with memories. WALLACE: Townsend was the oldest of Robert Kennedy's 11 children. She remembers how he always pushed himself. TOWNSEND: My bedroom was next his bathroom. And every morning I would hear him do his sit-ups while he listened to Shakespeare so that he could have the language to speak to the deepest issues in our -- in our American spirit. WALLACE: She was 16 when her father was assassinated. WALLACE (on camera): Do you feel at all cheated that you didn't have all the years with him you should have had? TOWNSEND: We were always taught about martyrs. We talked about sacrifice. It's hard to grow up in our family without the idea that life is filled with sacrifice. WALLACE (voice over): Townsend hesitates to speculate what her dad would think of our current politics, but she has no doubts on one subject. WALLACE (on camera): What do you think your father would say made of Donald Trump? TOWNSEND: He would be hurt by the pain that Donald Trump has caused so many people and the glee, it seems, that he takes in causing other people such pain. WALLACE (voice over): One more reason, she says, to keep her father's message alive. TOWNSEND: The idea that we're a generous people, that we're a compassionate people, that we have a goodness in us and that we need leaders that appeal to the good part of us. (END VIDEOTAPE) HEMMER: Kathleen Kennedy Townsend was lieutenant governor in Maryland for eight years. And these days she's focused on improving retirement security, noting half of all Americans have saved nothing for when they decide to stop working. That's it for today.

"The Trump administration is finally putting together the reasonable, coherent immigration policy America has needed for nearly 50 years. After all that fuss, all those dramas, government shutdowns, whatever, we learned last week that guess what?  The wall is being built  -- 60 miles already done and between 450 and 500 miles by the end of next year. As always, when we talk  immigration , I'll start by saying I'm pro-immigration. I'm an immigrant myself, twice over - my parents to Hungary and now me here to America, where, as I mentioned a couple of months ago, I hope I'll soon be a citizen. I think the vast majority of Americans are pro-immigration, as long as it is properly controlled. And I think the vast majority of Americans are compassionate people who want to give sanctuary to  refugees  fleeing persecution, as long as it is authentic. TRUMP TOUTS BORDER WALL PROGRESS, OPTIMISTIC AFTER RECENT COURT VICTORIES And by the way, that goes for the vast majority of  Trump  supporters -- decent people who just want the best for their country and are sick of being smeared as racists for supporting immigration policies which, let me remind you, were once widely held by  Democrats . Let's pick, I don't know, a couple of random Democrats. How about  Joe Biden  and  Chuck Schumer . ""Folks, I voted for a fence,"" Biden said in 2006. ""I voted, and unlike most Democrats -- some of you won't like this, but I voted for 700 miles."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER In 2009, Schumer said the following: ""Illegal immigration is wrong – plain and simple. Until the American people are convinced that we will stop future flows of illegal immigration, we will make no progress in dealing with the millions of illegal immigrants who are here now and on rationalizing our system of legal immigration – that’s plain and simple and unavoidable."" Who could possibly disagree with that? Oh ... In 2016, Biden said, ""We can't wall ourselves off from the problems that are not bound by borders -- the threat of communicable diseases like Zika, drug trafficking, climate change. No wall can be built."" 
In 2018, Schumer said, ""It is a shame that this president, who's plunging the nation into chaos, is throwing another temper tantrum and gonna hurt lots of innocent people. The Trump temper tantrum may produce a government shutdown. It will not get him his wall."" Yeah, a wall is immoral -- except both of them voted for the 2006 Secure Fence Act, which actually had more money in it for more wall than even President Trump is building. Whatever the issue, whatever the facts, if Trump's for it, they're against it, regardless of their previous views. What a bunch of total charlatans these Democrats are! It's the same idiocy with asylum. The president and his team  scored a major victory in the Supreme Court  this past week which lifted an injunction on a new rule which requires asylum seekers to claim asylum in the first safe country they come to, rather than travel through countries because they want to get to America and claim asylum here. Predictably, the Democrats lost their minds.  Nancy Pelosi  released a totally deranged and factually inaccurate statement, including this: “The Supreme Court’s decision to allow the Trump administration to inflict its cruel new asylum policy on the world’s most vulnerable populations at the southern border is deeply disappointing, profoundly dangerous and a clear departure from both U.S. and international law."" These people are so ridiculous. It's not a departure from international law; it brings us in line with international law. Do they even know that this new Trump asylum policy is basically the same as the European Union's? The Democrats and the establishment state media have totally lost the plot on immigration. That's because they've lost touch with working Americans. Look, there's a difference between asylum and migration. Of course, people want to come to America. It's the greatest place in the world. But you've got to have an orderly process. Public consent for immigration depends on government control of immigration. We haven't had that here since at least 1986, when President Reagan signed the disastrous Immigration Reform and Control Act, which did the exact opposite. El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are democracies, not dictatorships. Guatemala just voted in a new president. The Democrats and the establishment say those countries are corrupt -- well, yes, they are. But not as corrupt as Washington, where Vice President Biden took over a billion dollars in bribes from the Chinese government in the form of payments to Biden family businesses. Or where Vice President Dick Cheney engineered a war that funneled billions of dollars to the company where he was CEO. Or where members of Congress are funded by the exact same businesses they regulate. The asylum seekers are fleeing crime and gang violence, we're told. Yes, they are. But guess what? Those same gangs are here. The Democrats and the establishment state media have totally lost the plot on immigration. That's because they've lost touch with working Americans. It's not their jobs being lost; it's not their incomes going down. It's not their kids' schools being overwhelmed. By contrast, the Trump administration is finally putting together the reasonable, coherent immigration policy this country has been crying out for, for nearly 50 years. We see it with the wall going up, but it's much more than that. In many ways, it's five walls. The physical one, but also the legal one with the asylum change, a technology wall, an entitlement reform wall to help reduce incentives, and a foreign policy wall to encourage other countries to do more, as we saw with immediate results with Mexico and the tariffs threat. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On top of all that -- and totally contradicting the establishment lie that this is a xenophobic, restrictionist approach -- these are walls, as the saying goes, with a door. Months ago, the president announced a plan not to cut legal immigration but to keep it at present levels, opting instead to reform it to become a merit-based system. All of this is utterly reasonable and in line with mainstream opinion in this country. The Democrats' lurch to the open borders left, is the real extremist position on immigration today.

"SAN FRANCISCO — The rebuttal sounded something like a threat. That seemed to be  Kamala Harris ’s point. It was December 2003,  a final debate  in the final days before the runoff election in Ms. Harris’s race for San Francisco district attorney against her onetime boss, Terence Hallinan.  And  Mr. Hallinan, the crusading progressive incumbent, was going low: Ms. Harris could not be trusted to prosecute city corruption, he suggested, because of her relationship with Willie Brown — the outgoing mayor, peerless local kingmaker and Harris supporter whom she had dated years earlier. “He has an interest,” Mr. Hallinan speculated, “in having a friend in the district attorney’s office.” Ms. Harris conjured a different hypothetical. She would take on crooked actors of all kinds, she said. In fact, she already had a prospective target in mind. “I will set up a public integrity desk,” she vowed, building to the velocity of a TV lawyer in full riff, “dedicated to dealing with investigating and prosecuting cases involving corruption by  any  public official — be it  Terence Hallinan  or anyone else.” Mr. Hallinan seemed to wobble. “That really takes the breath away,” he said. Eight days later, Ms. Harris took his job away. Sixteen years on, as a California senator seeking the Democratic nomination for president, Ms. Harris is not, by her own admission, the candidate of structural upheaval, like Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont or Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. She is not an old-guard centrist, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. But in a party weighing how best to counter President Trump’s boundless capacity for brawling, Ms. Harris is the one who knows how to hit hardest, friends say, because that is how you win in San Francisco. The 2003 race, the first of her career, is where she learned. Image Ms. Harris receives the oath of office on Jan. 8, 2004. Credit George Nikitin/Associated Press “San Francisco is the bluest of blue,” said Tony West, her brother-in-law and longtime informal adviser. “All political wars there are civil wars. And so it’s like a family fight. And those are often the worst.” For Ms. Harris, who was 38 when she ran for district attorney, the campaign arrived at an inflection point — a period of restlessness, according to former colleagues, in the career of a hard-charging deputy accustomed to  straddling  disparate orbits. After a decade of unglamorous work for local prosecutors and a studied induction into San Francisco’s social elite, a Candidate Harris was by turns a society-page veteran  and a prolific loiterer at supermarket parking lots, unfurling an ironing board from her back seat as a canvas for campaign literature. She began her evenings at fund-raisers in ritzy Pacific Heights and ended them at the modest apartment where she lived alone in the city’s SoMa neighborhood, stretching across her living room floor to compose longhand thank-you notes to donors. “She was always the candidate who was like, ‘I got everything done on my list. Did you get everything done on your list?’” said Jim Stearns, a top consultant to Ms. Harris in 2003. Often enough, those lists included the kinds of strategic choices that seemed endemic to success in San Francisco politics, particularly against someone like Mr. Hallinan, known locally as “Kayo” (as in “K.O.,” for knockout) since his boxing youth. When her pledge to obey a voluntary campaign spending cap proved nettlesome, Ms. Harris  did not hesitate to reverse herself, earning a hefty ethics fine. Eager to extract information about her opponent’s operation, a senior Harris aide once posed as a Hallinan volunteer over email under an assumed name, before being found out and told to attend a nonexistent rally at 10 p.m. on a Sunday. And subjected to gendered insinuations that Mr. Brown, three decades her senior, had facilitated Ms. Harris’s rise by introducing her to the city’s ruling class, the candidate was quick to flag her rival’s own  sensational  baggage, accusing Mr. Hallinan of fostering a debauched workplace where prosecutors had sex in the office. It is no coincidence that some of Ms. Harris’s sharpest moments as a national voice have come in political combat.  As a senator, she has won viral recognition for her lacerating questioning during hearings.  In June, she flattened Mr. Biden in a debate exchange over his warm remembrances of segregationist senators. After some polling stumbles since then, she turned her attention to Mr. Trump from the Houston  debate stage on Thursday , comparing the president to the “really small dude” behind the curtain in “The Wizard of Oz.” [ Here are six takeaways from the September Democratic debate. ] Yet if her 2003 run proved that Ms. Harris could thrive in campaign conflict, it was also an early lesson in the challenges of negotiating the party’s base, particularly for a politician more inclined toward within-the-system reform than simmering revolution. In many ways, no 2020  candidate  has faced a hometown electorate more analogous to today’s Democratic primary conditions than Ms. Harris  has . Then, as now, she was a self-described progressive, introducing herself as a potentially history-making pick in a multicultural city of vanguard liberalism, parochial neighborhood factions and often staggering income inequality.  But Ms. Harris also ran unambiguously to Mr. Hallinan’s right in a place that prided itself on showing offenders compassion. “She was the moderate,” said Nathan Ballard, a friend who worked with her as a deputy city attorney. “She was somebody who wanted to prosecute criminals.” Getting that chance meant subjecting herself to an unpalatable fate: confronting the two men who had helped her, to a point, and were now threatening to stand in her way. “I mean, I know how to fight,” Ms. Harris said in an interview. “But most people like to avoid a fight if you can.” The Ex-Boss For a short while, the office was big enough for them both. After several years across the bay in Alameda County, Ms. Harris joined Mr. Hallinan’s team in 1998 as an assistant district attorney overseeing the career criminal unit.   Friends say Ms. Harris initially admired his instinct for empathetic prosecution, which prized diversion over jail for many nonviolent lawbreakers. She spent off-hours helping his 1999 re-election and took a particular interest the next year in trying to defeat a state ballot measure, also opposed by Mr. Hallinan, that effectively shifted many young offenders into the adult justice system. This, it seems, is where some of the tensions began. Fred Gardner, an office spokesman at the time, said that Mr. Hallinan became concerned as Ms. Harris assumed a public-facing role in the ballot debate, growing suspicious that Ms. Harris might run against him. (Mr. Hallinan’s son, Brendan, said his father, now 82, was not able to give an interview.) In Ms. Harris’s telling, the office, which Mr. Hallinan had steered since 1996, was tumbling into disarray — epitomized one afternoon, she said, by a mass firing of lawyers who returned from lunch to find pink slips on their chairs. “The place was falling apart,” Ms. Harris said in the interview. “People were urging me to run.” She left in 2000 for the city attorney’s office. Mr. Hallinan did not attend the send-off. Some other lawyers stayed away, too, Mr. Gardner said, fearing that they would “get reported back to the boss as disloyal.” He estimated that half the office attended anyway. No longer under Mr. Hallinan’s purview, Ms. Harris began considering a campaign to replace him in  earnest .   She produced a low-tech bio page, pressing a photograph of herself against the sheet and making multiple copies. “I think we went to, like, Kinko’s,” Ms. Harris said. “Very high-level, professional operation.” Mr. Stearns, her consultant, cautioned that Ms. Harris was occupying a dangerous political space: the center — wedged between Mr. Hallinan and a more conservative challenger named Bill Fazio. “He kind of scratched his head and said, ‘O.K., this is going to be difficult because you’re running up the middle,’” Ms. Harris said. “I have this saying, which is: ‘No good public policy ends with an exclamation point.’” Ms. Harris, who has strained at times as a presidential candidate to convince progressives of her convictions, was asked if this tension felt familiar lately. “There probably are some parallels,” she said. “There’s an appetite for statements that end with an exclamation point. And it’s really challenging.” Mr. Hallinan’s supporters believe his punctuation, as it were, was commendable for a district attorney, praising his commitment to rehabilitating drug users in the throes of the tough-on-crime era. Kenneth Wine, a longtime law partner of Mr. Hallinan’s brother’s, said that while Ms. Harris was “a good, honest, straightforward prosecutor,” she won the job in part by questioning the kind of progressivism that Mr. Hallinan championed. “He shocked a lot of people with his progressive ideas,” Mr. Wine said. “Kamala Harris became the D.A. sort of backtracking on those to some extent.” Ms. Harris liked to say there was nothing progressive about being “soft on crime.” Volunteers furnished doorknobs with fliers stuffed with muscular adjectives (“Tough. Fair. Effective.”), trumpeting her support from law enforcement groups. The headshots of local elected endorsers specked her campaign materials. And about five or so faces into that roster — not so prominent as to draw immediate attention, not so buried as to suggest deliberate camouflage — voters were greeted by a smiling mayor. The Ex-Boyfriend The thing was, it could feel as though everyone who hit it big here owed a debt to Willie Brown — the showman power broker enamored of Brioni suits, well-directed patronage and his own legend. The current California governor, Gavin Newsom, was a young businessman when Mr. Brown elevated him to the city’s Parking and Traffic Commission and, soon after, to the Board of Supervisors — placing Mr. Newsom on the fast track to succeed him at City Hall. The current mayor, London Breed, was once an intern in Mr. Brown’s administration. Ms. Harris’s example is more complicated. She began dating Mr. Brown, now 85, around 1994, when she was working in Alameda County and he was speaker of the California Assembly. He appointed her to two well-compensated state posts. He gave her a BMW. He introduced her to people worth knowing. “When I first met her, she was Willie’s girlfriend,” said John Burton, a former congressman and chairman of the California Democratic Party. “Everybody gets their start through somebody else. Jack Kennedy got his start through his father. Bobby got his start through Jack.” Ms. Harris’s allies have bristled at any suggestion that Mr. Brown powered her ascent, dismissing the charge as sexist and making clear that she was plenty capable of impressing on her own. Few could argue that Ms. Harris, hovering around 5 percent in early polling, entered the 2003 race at much of an advantage, even as her fund-raising drew on an ungainly Filofax full of high-end contacts. (Eventually, friends insisted she transfer to a Palm Pilot.) Fair or not, Ms. Harris understood quickly that Mr. Brown would shadow the campaign. “No woman likes to be judged by who she dates,” said Rebecca Prozan, a top 2003 campaign aide. “Was it something that we wanted to address? No. Was it something we had to address? Yes.” Ms. Harris hoped to maintain distance without alienating his supporters. An internal memo suggested hiring Mr. Stearns as a consultant in part because he was associated with “the anti-Willie Brown camp which may be helpful.” Ms. Harris  told SF Weekly  in 2003 that she was so independent of Mr. Brown that he “would probably right now express some fright about the fact that he cannot control me.” “His career is over,” she said, as Mr. Brown’s second mayoral term wound down. “I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years.” But Ms. Harris also promoted Mr. Brown’s support on her fliers. And his barely hidden hand helped propel her precedent-busting fund-raising. “He was instrumental behind the scenes,” said Mark Buell, a major Democratic donor who served as Ms. Harris’s finance chairman. “Willie Brown told me — and I didn’t want to believe him — you have to raise $1 million to win this race. And we did.” Mr. Brown, who now writes political columns, cheekily declined to be interviewed, on the grounds that he could not assist a rival publication. “I write for The Chronicle,” he said, quickly ending a phone call. (In one of those columns in January, he  wrote : “Yes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago. Yes, I may have influenced her career.”) Ms. Harris, in the interview, called her 2003 opponents’ references to Mr. Brown “frustrating” and “designed to degrade, frankly, the conversation about why we needed a new D.A.” Asked if Mr. Brown was a factor in the race — either as a boogeyman deployed by her rivals or as a sitting mayor with an interest in the outcome — Ms. Harris said: “Um, I’d — you know. You can ask the pundits. I — yeah.” Asked if she found the attacks misogynistic, she said, “I think most people think that that’s the case.” The Next District Attorney Enough voters seemed to. Just before the election, the campaign of Mr. Hallinan’s other challenger, Mr. Fazio, circulated a mailer quoting a woman critical of Ms. Harris: “I don’t care if Willie Brown is Kamala  Harris ’ ex-boyfriend,”  it read . “What bothers me is that Kamala accepted two appointments from Willie Brown to high-paying, part-time state boards.” The approach backfired . Former Harris aides credit public disgust over the mailer with helping to push her into the two-person runoff at the expense of Mr. Fazio, who   had been polling ahead of Ms. Harris throughout the race. (Reached by phone, Mr. Fazio said he did not remember the mailer but suggested it sounded like “some desperation on my campaign’s part.” He said he supported Ms. Harris’s presidential run.) Perhaps more relevant, Ms. Harris proved to be a relentless and versatile campaigner, parking herself at transit stops, gay bars and senior-center bingo sessions where she worried her hot streak one night might upset the regulars. She established her headquarters in the predominantly nonwhite Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood, posing for photographs beneath an indoor graffiti mural that read “Justice” and watching her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, instruct supporters on proper envelope-stuffing form. Ms. Harris also excelled in more exclusive company. She held events with the musician Boz Scaggs and Eve Ensler, author of “The Vagina Monologues.” She  persuaded the party’s powerful central committee to withhold an endorsement before the first round of voting, a major setback for Mr. Hallinan. On the night of the runoff, Ms. Harris entered her victory party to chants of “D.A.! D.A.!” as “We Are the Champions” blared, relatives gathered beside the “Justice” mural and Mr. Brown held court with reporters. Mr. Hallinan was terse in conceding defeat. “It’s a tough job,” he said, wishing Ms. Harris luck. More recently, Ms. Harris has likewise found that the city’s politics can be fickle. Many of San Francisco’s progressive activists prefer Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders. Mr. Buell, her 2003 finance chairman, remains a supporter but has also raised money for Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. “I think she’s a little miffed,” Mr. Buell said. And in the city’s latest district attorney’s race, to be decided in November, Mr. Stearns has taken on a new client: Chesa Boudin, a public defender running on reducing mass incarceration. “He is actively criticizing Kamala’s record,” Mr. Stearns said. “2003 has never seemed so much like yesterday.” Kitty Bennett contributed research."
"WASHINGTON — Former Vice President  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  is 76 years old and prone to sometimes-rambling monologues with antiquated references. But if his age and missteps are supposed to be liabilities, they haven’t helped rivals who have tried to use them to their advantage. Julián Castro , the former housing secretary, was the  latest to learn that the hard way , taking direct aim at Mr. Biden’s age, and memory, in last Thursday’s debate. It didn’t work for Mr. Castro — amid a backlash, he lost a key endorsement over the weekend — and it hasn’t worked throughout the 2020 campaign.  While younger candidates have presented themselves as agents of generational change, it is three septuagenarians who have emerged as the front-runners: Mr. Biden, 78-year-old Senator  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont and 70-year-old Senator  Elizabeth Warren  of Massachusetts. They have generated the most support and enthusiasm, and taken their place in the top tier of the polls as they seek to challenge a president who is 73 himself.  And neither their age, nor Mr. Biden’s sometimes unsteady speaking performance, has convinced voters to get behind other candidates perceived as untested on the national stage. “I ran a generational campaign that wanted to take on issues that were affecting my generation and future generations,” said Representative Eric Swalwell of California, who centered his presidential campaign around gun violence and student debt before  withdrawing in July . “Those issues are really important, but beating Donald Trump is the most important thing that most voters want. I just sensed that they weren’t going to roll the dice on a generational candidate.” The debate last week produced further scrutiny of age as a factor in the primary. Within days, Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren were all asked whether they would release their medical records — and said they would. Even a hoarse voice that forced Mr. Sanders  to cancel some events Monday and Tuesday  was subject to some age-related speculation .  Mr. Biden’s debate performance left him once again open to questions about his age and acuity. He bungled the name of Moms Demand Action, the nation’s leading gun control group. He answered a question about institutional racism with  a rambling tangent  that included the suggestion that parents “make sure you have the record player on at night.”  During the July debate , Mr. Biden forgot whether he was directing voters to his website or signing them up to receive text messages from the campaign.  Some voters have noticed. “I want Joe Biden to be able to complete a sentence better than I can,” said Melanie Gee, 58, a retired antiques dealer who attended a women’s event in Birmingham, Ala., on Monday. “I don’t think he’s senile. I just think he’s not as a sharp as I want him to be.” Yvette Simpson, the chief executive of Democracy for America, a liberal group, said she worried about Mr. Biden’s ability to “deliver a clear message at a time when a clear message is important to the American people.’’ But while Mr. Biden’s missteps have at times put him on the defensive, his rivals have struggled to frame them in a way that diminishes him and enhances their own candidacies. Sometimes it just  looks meanspirited.  Mr. Castro took the starkest shot yet at Mr. Biden’s capabilities during a heated exchange over health care policy at the debate. “Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?” Mr. Castro said, repeating himself three times. It had the effect of thrusting out into the open a fact that has been the subtext of other candidates’ strategies for months. Later that night, Senator  Cory Booker  of New Jersey also expressed reservations about Mr. Biden, telling CNN that “there are definitely moments when you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder.” The attacks failed. By Sunday, Mr. Booker had backed off his Biden criticism — not the first time he’d done so during the campaign . And Representative Vicente González of Texas defected from supporting Mr. Castro to Mr. Biden, in part because of Mr. Castro’s provocative questions on the debate stage, according to people familiar with his decision. “If you’re polling in the low single digits and you’re not raising any resources and you’re fracturing your party and you’re just getting your supporters to be upset at other candidates, it certainly can’t be a good thing for our party,” Mr. González said Sunday on CNN, alluding to Mr. Castro’s attack. At the same time, Mr. Biden’s defenders become protective of him when pressed with questions about his age. Former Senator Barbara Boxer of California, who is neutral in the 2020 primary, said criticisms of Mr. Biden’s age are “ageist.”  “He started off very strong and as it went on, he was trying to  get in too  many things, too many facts,” Ms. Boxer, 78, said of Mr. Biden’s debate performance. “It’s very hard standing there for three hours. I don’t care if you’re 55 years old.” “That is just political attacks, right now people trying to figure out any way to try to knock the front-runner down,” Senator Doug Jones of Alabama said Sunday after attending a church service with Mr. Biden, whom he backs. “Joe’s going to be Joe. And that’s why people love him, and they know his history.” There has been a clear recalibration among the second-tier candidates, who seem to have realized that drawing clear age contrasts with Mr. Biden — as Mayor  Pete Buttigieg  of South Bend, Ind., had been doing since his campaign began — is a losing strategy. And not all of Mr. Biden’s younger rivals are eager to stress their age difference. “Who the hell cares,”  Beto O’Rourke  said Sunday on “Meet the Press.” “The last thing I care about is Joe Biden’s age.” For Mr. Biden, no concern is raised more consistently by  voters than his age , a subject Mr. Biden himself has said is fair game. When asked by reporters for his response, he often instructs voters to watch him in action on the trail, where he has made shows of physical force by sprinting through parades or lingering late into the evening to shake hands. In July, Mr. Biden’s doctor said that he was in “ excellent physical condition .”  Black voters, who comprise a critical bloc of Mr. Biden’s support, are not punishing him for his age, said Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a super PAC focused on African-American Democrats. The black primary electorate skews older and is sympathetic to Mr. Biden’s age, she said. “A lot of the age critique centers on cultural issues, record players and texting, which many of those voters struggle with as well but don’t see as disqualifying,” Ms. Shropshire said. Mr. Sanders, who is 15 months older than Mr. Biden, and Ms. Warren do not face the degree of scrutiny about their age that Mr. Biden does, even as some voters at their events admit they would like to see someone younger elected president. Mr. Sanders’s events are high-energy affairs, punctuated by the senator frequently waving his arms to emphasize his points. It also helps that he rarely deviates from themes in his stump speech, affording him far fewer opportunities to make off-the-cuff gaffes. Still, he lost his voice during a campaign swing through Iowa and Colorado last week — a fact that became evident to millions watching last week’s debate. “I kind of lost my voice somewhere in Colorado, and I hope I don’t have to go back there right away to find it again,” he joked Saturday in Las Vegas. Some on the Sanders team have acknowledged privately that his raspiness is not his best look. The Sanders campaign cut short a planned swing through South Carolina on Monday and Tuesday. The campaign said he was “feeling great” but would return home to Vermont to “rest his vocal cords.” Among the three candidates in their 70s atop the polls, Ms. Warren is the most crisp when speaking to crowds and fielding questions on the debate stage. “The medical records will be there, and anybody’s welcome to take a look at them,” she said. “And what I’m hoping is, we’re going to get to do a lot more town halls between now and then, and more after that.” If Ms. Warren wants her town halls and public appearances to speak for themselves on her stamina, she is likely aware that her entrances and exits are part of the case. She sprints as she enters campaign events. A video of her  jogging across a grassy field  at an event in New Hampshire last month went viral, and she was even caught on camera  running into Penn Station  in New York to catch a train earlier this year. “Age is a figure of speech,” said Harry Reid, the former Senate Democratic leader, who is 79. “I think it’s an exaggeration to start crossing people off the list because they’re 70 years old.” Katie Glueck and Lisa Lerer contributed reporting from Birmingham, Ala., Sydney Ember contributed reporting from Las Vegas and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Washington."
"But Warren and other Democrats will also need another set of plans -- for how to campaign against President Trump in 2020 on the perilous election playing field that they will face. If being ""electable"" is the top priority for Democrats, then voters should be hearing more about the political strategy of each candidate, not just their policies.  With Trump at the top of the Republican ticket, this won't be an ordinary election. As Hillary Clinton learned in 2016 -- when, for example, Republican delegates were encouraged by convention speakers in chanting ""Lock Her Up! -- the old rules no longer apply.   What's the plan for dealing with President Trump's media chaos machine?   In any presidential campaign, a main objective for each party is to influence the media narrative. The goal is to shift the conversation among producers, editors, and reporters toward issues that are favorable to their campaign.   Whoever the Democratic nominee is, this will be an immense challenge. The President has repeatedly demonstrated his ability to use Twitter and campaign rallies to throw the media into a frenzy over his latest outrage or controversial statement. If Democrats want to keep issues like health care or inequality front and center, they will need to have a plan for counteracting Trump's uncanny ability to send the news cycle down a rabbit hole debate about the latest thing that he has done. What's the plan for dealing with social media disinformation? By all accounts the social disinformation campaign that  we will see  in 2020 will make the last election look like child's play. The President has already raised a campaign war chest to finance social media operations on Facebook, Twitter, and more. The Democratic candidate will have to survive an onslaught of divisive videos, memes and stories as well as outright falsehoods circulating in the online public square.   These efforts will be compounded by third party operations, as well as overseas governments seeking to interfere in the election. When the President retweeted an altered video of Speaker Nancy Pelosi that made it appear as if she was inebriated, he offered just a small preview of what's to come.  What's the plan for surviving reality show debates?  The fall debates, assuming that they take place and the President agrees to participate, could well be uglier than a hard core professional wrestling match. Trump will turn each debate into a piece of reality show television. He might convene pre-debate press conferences with guests who are politically damaging to his opponent, as he did in 2016. He will physically hover around his opponent as they speak and blast them with insults, and he will make it literally impossible to sustain any kind of conversation about public policy. The President will lie and twist the truth without   remorse. Julian Castro's barbs against Joe Biden last Thursday will seem innocuous by comparison. For any Democrat, it will feel like the longest hours of their lives, with cameras trained on them as they try to make it through without losing their composure.  What's the plan for confronting investigations? Unlike in 2016, this time around Trump has the power of the presidency behind him. With that power comes the potential for the administration to unleash damaging investigations in the middle of the campaign that will put the Democrats on defense. Already there have been hints of where the administration might go should Biden be the nominee, with stories about Rudy Giuliani urging investigation into conflict of interest allegations about Hunter Biden while Joe Biden was Vice President.  Joe Biden has denied the allegations and numerous reporters have  shot down  the existing claims. When running against Hillary Clinton, candidate Trump capitalized on an email investigation by the FBI over which he had no control. Now he is President -- with immense power -- and it is fair to speculate that he will use it to improve his odds for victory.  Too often, the discussions about the rival candidates revolve around early poll numbers and memories of how elections worked in the past. This won't be the case come next fall, and Democrats won't have any excuse to say at that point,""I can't believe this is happening!""  The kind of politics that Democrats will confront are now perfectly clear, and the party needs to give much more serious thought to the question of which of the candidates will be best suited to sell their message and mobilize voters in our new dystopian political world. "
"The plan will cost approximately $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years, the Vermont independent said during a speech in Las Vegas, acknowledging that it is ""expensive.""  Sanders said he will call for a national rent control standard, ""capping annual rent increases throughout the country at no more than one and a half times the rate of inflation or three percent, whichever is higher,"" he said.  Sanders did not offer specifics on how he would pay for the plan aside from raising taxes on ""the top one-tenth of one percent"" of American households. He stressed that under his housing proposal, ""99.9 percent of Americans will not see their taxes go up by one nickel."" He noted that his late mother's dream -- that their family would move out of their rent-controlled Brooklyn apartment and into their own home -- never happened. ""But during her life, at least our family was always able to afford a roof over our heads, because we were living in a rent-controlled building, which meant that for our family and all the other families in our building, rents could not be arbitrarily raised,"" he said. Sanders also announced that he will expand the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund and create an additional two million units of mixed-income housing, which he said would ""create many, many good-paying union jobs.""  He would fully fund the Section 8 rental assistance program and establish anti-discrimination protections for program recipients against landlords, he said. Sanders called to invest more than $32 billion over the next five years to address homelessness, $70 billion to repair and grow public housing, and $50 billion in state and local grants to create community land trusts. He also called for empowering localities ""to go even further to protect tenants from the skyrocketing price of housing"" and to ""require real estate developers to include affordable housing in the construction of new developments."""
"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 14 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com BFFs in D.C.? Apparently not U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and  Kamala Harris  of California. According to reports, Feinstein, the senior senator from the Golden State, will throw a fundraiser next month for  Democratic 2020 presidential  frontrunner  Joe Biden  -- and not for Harris, another White House contender whose poll numbers suggest she could probably use some high-profile help. Feinstein and husband Richard Blum will co-host the Biden event Oct. 3 in San Francisco, according to a copy of the invitation obtained by CNBC. Feinstein first gave her backing to Biden in January, months before the former vice president made his campaign official in April.  FEINSTEIN BACKING BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT, SNUBBING FELLOW CALIFORNIAN KAMALA HARRIS: REPORT “My candidate would be Joe Biden,” Feinstein told CNBC back then. “I watched him as vice president. I’ve seen him operate. I’ve seen him perform and I think he brings a level of experience and seniority, which I think is really important.” The early evening reception will be the first that Feinstein hosts for Biden in the 2020 election,  CNBC  reported. Her husband has already participated in several fundraising events for Biden, who campaigned for Feinstein in 2018, when she was re-elected by a landslide.  Feinstein has repeatedly faced questions about why she prefers Biden -- who was her Senate colleague for nearly two decades -- over Harris, her home state’s junior senator. Harris and Biden famously butted heads during Democratic presidential debate earlier this year when Harris challenged Biden’s stance decades ago on the issue of desegregation school busing when he was a U.S. senator from Delaware. “She’s brand-new here,” Feinstein told the  Los Angeles Times  about Harris in January when asked if she would support a Harris run for the White House. “It takes a little bit of time to get to know somebody.” She also told the Washington Examiner in May when Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee he made her the “first woman” to serve on the panel. “I love Kamala, I appreciate her,” Feinstein said, “but that’s what I’m going to do. I feel very loyal to him."" Ticket prices begin at $1,000 and cap out at $2,800 per person for the October event. Several other hosts will join Feinstein and Blum on the stage, including Denise Bauer, a former ambassador to Belgium, the emailed invitation said. Feinstein and Blum are not listed as hosts for a fundraising lunch to be held in nearby Palo Alto, Calif., earlier that day.

"Several Democratic presidential candidates called for the impeachment of  Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh  on Sunday after The New York Times published new information about allegations of sexual misconduct against him, while Republican leaders condemned the reporting as irresponsible and defended him. President Trump  on Twitter accused news outlets of trying to pressure the justice into taking more liberal positions and suggested, without elaborating, that the “Justice Department should come to his rescue.” On Saturday, The Times  published an essay  in its Opinion section adapted from a forthcoming book, “The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,” by two Times reporters,  Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly,  who  helped cover his confirmation hearings . The reporters wrote that they spent 10 months investigating the allegations of sexual misconduct and assault at the center of the hearings, including one by a former Yale classmate,  Deborah Ramirez . She recalled being at a dorm party where participants were drinking heavily and said that  Mr. Kavanaugh  had thrust his penis in her face, prompting her to swat it away and inadvertently touch it.

We look at how her testimony came to embody a culture at a crossroads — and at what’s changed since then. michael barbaro Megan, Jodi, take us back to this moment a year ago. Where is the country? jodi kantor Let’s actually go back a little earlier than that. Let’s go back to the summer of 2018. archived recording Bill Cosby, comedian, actor the man once dubbed America’s dad. Tonight, the 80-year-old is convicted on three counts of aggravated indecent assault. Kevin Spacey is being investigated by Scotland Yard for three new cases of sexual assault. With that new trouble for disgraced celebrity chef, Mario Batali. Obviously, these allegations of sexual harassment, sexual assault — a lot of things are in motion here. jodi kantor It’s been months and months since the Weinstein story broke, and #MeToo too has become this global phenomenon. archived recording This is somebody — this happened to me, too. #MeToo has been — the phrase has been used consistently about about this case, it happened to them, too. jodi kantor But there’s also a lot of controversy and a kind of sense of mounting unfairness. A real backlash is accumulating. archived recording Actress Catherine Deneuve denounced the movement because she believes people who did not deserve to be condemned are facing the same consequences as sex offenders. If you try and make a pass at someone, try and indicate that you’re interested, put maybe a hand on her knee, you could be accused of sexual harassment, lose your job — jodi kantor Saying that the whole thing has gone way too far. archived recording And I wanted — I wanted more evidence. I wanted — jodi kantor And we’re seeing that tension play out in the news every single day. archived recording Now to new developments in this bombshell allegations against the head of CBS. jodi kantor Ronan Farrow reports a very powerful story about Les Moonves. archived recording That includes allegations from six women ranging from unwanted touching to what several of the sources termed sexual assault. As Leslie Moonves spoke about the company’s quarterly earnings, there was no mention of the accusations against him. His lawyers apparently advised him not to discuss the issue. And to some people’s surprise, analysts didn’t ask. jodi kantor But Moonves refuses to step down. archived recording The premiere of Louis C.K.‘s new film was just canceled. jodi kantor Because of the accusations against Louis C.K., he’s basically lost his platform as a comedian. archived recording This past weekend, after nine months out of the spotlight, the comedian took the stage at New York’s Comedy Cellar. jodi kantor But then all of a sudden, that summer, he begins to come back. archived recording In response, social media erupted. One tweet: “It seems I missed the part when Louis C.K. served time. I just remember him living quietly as a millionaire for less than a year.” jodi kantor He shows up in comedy clubs and begins to make appearances. archived recording It might be the most controversial moment of the #MeToo movement yet. Accusations against actor Aziz Ansari. jodi kantor So there’s an accumulating series of questions about what to do with these men. And then there are cases like the one involving Aziz Ansari, that it just feels like nobody knows quite what to do with — archived recording Much of the media world seems to agree the story told by the woman who calls herself Grace about her date with comedian Aziz Ansari certainly does not rise to the level of Harvey Weinstein type misconduct. jodi kantor — the question of whether or how much he really did wrong is very, very much in dispute. archived recording As feminists, aren’t we empowered to say no? Yes, of course — I just — I don’t get why we expect him to be a mind reader — I don’t think he was asked to be a mind reader. How wasn’t he? megan twohey So there’s this web of complicated unanswered questions, and this scientific researcher in California is about to walk right into them. michael barbaro Last month on “The Daily,” Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor told the story of their investigation into Harvey Weinstein, a story that seemed to unite the country in redefining the rules around sex and power. But one year after the Weinstein story broke, a Supreme Court confirmation process came to be seen as a kind of national trial of the #MeToo movement. Today, on the anniversary of that confirmation, new reporting from Megan and Jodi’s book, “She Said,” on the untold story of the woman at the center of that confirmation process, and the journey that led to her testimony in Washington. It’s Friday, October 4. So what do we need to know about Christine Blasey Ford? megan twohey This series of events is set in motion in June of 2018. archived recording (donald trump) And we will begin our search for a new justice of the United States Supreme Court that will begin immediately. megan twohey President Trump comes out with his list of potential nominees for this newly open seat on the Supreme Court. archived recording (donald trump) We have a very excellent list of great talented, highly educated, highly intelligent, hopefully tremendous people. I think the list is very outstanding. megan twohey And back in California, Christine Blasey Ford is sitting on a story about one of those potential nominees. archived recording (donald trump) So it will be somebody from that list. So we have now boiled it down to about 25 people. megan twohey And Ford emails a friend one of several people that she’s told her account to over the years. And she says, quote, “The favorite for SCOTUS is the jerk who assaulted me in high school. He’s my age, so he’ll be on the court the rest of my life.” And a friend writes back, he says, “I remember you telling me about him, but I don’t remember his name. Do you mind telling me so that I can read about him?” And she replies, “Brett Kavanaugh.” So in this moment, in this sort of private moment, the clock starts ticking. jodi kantor There were all these deadlines, and turning points, and external forces that were going to bring very difficult decisions for Christine Blasey Ford. And the first one came on July 9. archived recording President Trump now says he plans to announce his nominee for the US Supreme Court on July 9, one week from Monday. archived recording (donald trump) I think you’ll be very impressed. These are very talented people, brilliant people, and I think you’re going to really love it. jodi kantor So in the days beforehand, Christine Blasey Ford has a real difficult dilemma, because she felt that she had critical information to provide about a nominee, but she doesn’t know what to do with it. She didn’t know who to trust, or who she could tell, or really, how to go to somebody in charge. She knew that President Trump was going to appoint a conservative judge, but she thought that perhaps there was one who did not have this kind of liability. archived recording Sources tell CBS News the president is focused on four finalists. The top contenders are said to be federal judges, Amy Connie Barrett of Indiana, Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland, and Raymond Kethledge of Michigan. jodi kantor So on July 6, she makes a phone call. The person she’s calling is Representative Anna Eshoo. This is her congressional representative, a Democrat. And a young woman picks up the phone, and immediately, Ford blurts out what she has to say. She says, someone on the Supreme Court shortlist sexually assaulted me in high school. I need to talk to someone in the office. It’s urgent, Trump is about to make his selection. She’s told that somebody will call her back soon. So then she picks up her phone again and she contacts The Washington Post. She clicks on their tip line and she writes, potential Supreme Court nominee with assistance from his friend assaulted me in mid 1980s in Maryland. Have therapy records talking about it. Feel like I shouldn’t be quiet, but not willing to put family in D.C. and CA through a lot of stress. Now she thinks her phone is going to ring immediately, either from The Washington Post or from her congressperson’s office. But in fact, nobody gets back to her. And sure enough, on July 9. archived recording (donald trump) Tonight, it is my honor and privilege to announce that I will nominate — jodi kantor President Trump announces his nominee. archived recording (donald trump) — Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. michael barbaro So Brett Kavanaugh is now the president’s nominee for the Supreme Court. What happens next? megan twohey Well, to begin with, the people that Ford had been trying to contact to avoid Kavanaugh becoming the nomination, they’re now available to talk to her. And she has a new decision on her hands. Does she want to move forward with reporting this allegation she doesn’t want to do so in a very public way. Her hope, her belief is that she can share this information with the people who are making the decision. So she moves forward, she meets with her Congresswoman. July 18, they meet. She spells out what had happened. And Eshoo’s office says, O.K., if you’re going to go this kind of civic route of reporting this, then you need to stop talking to The Washington Post, and in fact, stop telling other people. But by this point, word had started to trickle out through her group of friends and into the broader Palo Alto community, including to some of the #MeToo activists. And so she’s getting messages passed along from those people. You know, a friend of hers actually sends a text message saying this is a crucial time in history. michael barbaro Wow. megan twohey Encouraging her to come forward. This account was starting to become much bigger than her alone. And meanwhile, while all of this is playing out behind the scenes, Kavanaugh’s nomination is moving forward in public. archived recording But for the president talking to the folks at the White House, they seem to be confident that their pick, Judge Kavanaugh, will sail through. That Judge Brett Kavanaugh is quite simply the most qualified and the most deserving nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States. megan twohey A lot of the focus is on his support for women and girls. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) I have tried to create bonds with my daughters like my dad created with me. megan twohey The fact that he has coached his daughter’s girls basketball team. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) For the past seven years, I’ve coached my daughters’ basketball teams. megan twohey And the fact that he has hired a lot of female clerks. archived recording Like, everything from his mother’s record, and teaching, and then putting yourself through law school, his relationship with his girls — I might be just drinking Kool-Aid, I don’t know, but I sat there, I was like, this guy seems so amazing. megan twohey So Ford is agonizing over what to do now that Kavanaugh has been nominated, and she’s hearing all of these glowing accounts of his record with women. And she wants her account to be considered, too. And so at the end of July, Congresswoman Eshoo’s office instructs her to write a letter to the committee, to the ranking members of the committee that’s going to be voting on Kavanaugh’s nomination. But Ford chooses to only send that letter to the ranking Democrat, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. It’s her understanding that as a constituent of Feinstein’s, she’s going to be guaranteed confidentiality. michael barbaro Mm-hmm. megan twohey And she has told us that in that moment of submitting the letter to Feinstein’s office that it dawned on her for the first time, oh my god, I need a lawyer. And she ends up working with Debbie Katz and Lisa Banks, two of the more prominent feminist attorneys in the country who are based in Washington, and the story that’s starting to unfold. jodi kantor So that’s when I get a call from one of those lawyers, Debbie Katz. It’s Saturday, August 11. She’s just met for a couple of days before. She’s already sounding very, very worried. She doesn’t tell us Ford’s name, but what she says is that this client is completely credible, that she’s a scientist, that she’s very precise, that she tells her story very consistently. That Katz really, really believes her. But what she also said is that she doesn’t quite know what she’s gotten herself into. She says my new client is naive about how big this could become. Katz doesn’t really have a point of view at this point about whether she should come forward or not, but she wants me to quietly pass along the story to the paper. To ask the editors to further investigate Kavanaugh’s treatment of women, because she wants to know if there’s a pattern here or if her client is alone. And by the way, she had asked Feinstein’s office the same thing. This was what she was trying to find out. michael barbaro And the paper does start to look more closely at Kavanaugh’s record with women. But Ford’s story itself, her allegations aren’t published in The Times. megan twohey Right. And we now know that that’s because at this moment in time she has decided to go the congressional route. And in deciding to go the congressional route, she’s now facing a new deadline. archived recording President Trump’s pick to be the next Supreme Court justice will get his Senate confirmation hearing next month. megan twohey The Senate Judiciary hearings on Kavanaugh’s nomination are set to begin right after Labor Day. archived recording Hearings for Brett Kavanaugh will begin on September 4. It’s a process the Trump administration has said it wants it wrapped up before November’s midterm elections. megan twohey So she has to make a decision before then. jodi kantor But remember, it’s a confusing situation, because she doesn’t even know these new lawyers. She is in California, they’re in D.C., they’re having these intense phone calls. These lawyers, Debbie Katz and Lisa Banks, are trying not to impose a point of view on her. They really feel that the decision has to be hers. But on the other hand, she’s sitting there in California saying, what do these lawyers want me to do? Do they have a point of view on this? megan twohey And into this mix comes Ricki Seidman. And Ricki Seidman was a veteran of Supreme Court confirmation battles and a longtime Democratic operative. She had a lot of experience in Supreme Court confirmation battles. In fact, she had been working on the committee that had first learned of Anita Hill’s allegations against Clarence Thomas. And she had encouraged Hill to speak further to the committee at great personal toll to Hill. And so she enters the picture. And she brings with her all this concern that the exact same thing could happen to Ford if she came forward. And so Katz and Banks, the lawyers are, trying their best to be neutral and weigh out the potential pros and cons. But Seidman is pretty adamant. In fact, at one point she flies to California and meets with Ford in person, and spells out all the reasons she thinks she should not come forward. jodi kantor So Ford at that point has not made a decision and her team feels that she really needs to because the nomination is moving forward in Washington. It’s very heated, it’s very partisan, but it looks like things are ultimately going to go pretty smoothly for Kavanaugh. And so what they decide to do in order to facilitate a decision on Ford’s part is they set an artificial deadline. They say by August 29, which is a few days before the hearings are going to begin, we’re going to choose one of three letters that we’re writing. And they actually draft these three letters, and it’s like each letter could lead to a different outcome not only for Ford but for the country. They’re all variations on the choices she could make. So Ford and her team are looking at these letters and Ford still can’t make a decision, and their deadline passes. And then it’s Thursday, which is the day after the deadline. And at this point, the hearings are really about to begin. And she is just unable to choose. Katz says to her, this is a life defining decision, and it’s yours. But Ford can’t make a decision, and that in effect becomes the decision. That night, she sends one of her sons to sleep with her husband, and she climbs into his IKEA bed. And she says to herself, look, on some level, I deserved the chance to try this. And sitting there in her child’s bed, she sobs. megan twohey And so on September 4, the Kavanaugh hearings begin. And sure, there’s some controversy, but for the most part, it’s looking like smooth sailing that Kavanaugh will in fact be easily confirmed. But the following week on Monday, Ford back in California shows up for her first day of teaching. And it’s clear that word of her allegation is continuing to seep out. At the end of class, she is approached by a reporter from BuzzFeed who says, I know about the letter. She orders the reporter to leave the classroom, to leave the building. But there are reporters who are showing up at her home, that are calling her colleagues. And on September 12 — archived recording Tonight, the mysterious new twist about Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. There is a bombshell report involving Brett Kavanaugh — megan twohey The Intercept, an online publication, actually publishes an article. archived recording It is quite a doozy. We don’t know too many details about these allegations. megan twohey About the fact that the Democrats are aware that Feinstein has received a letter about Kavanaugh and something that happened with a woman in high school and that they’re trying to obtain it. archived recording So let me give you her exact quote on this. She says, I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further. And I have honored that decision — megan twohey After all of that deliberation that ended with Ford not coming forward, there are now all of these other external forces coming into play again that are basically starting to take her story out of her own hands. And in this moment, she realizes, O.K., it looks like my best course of action is to actually tell my story to The Washington Post. michael barbaro We’ll be right back. jodi kantor So that afternoon, my phone rings, and it’s Debbie Katz, and she’s calling me in the middle of this whole thing. And she says to me, my client can’t testify. michael barbaro And why is she saying that to you? jodi kantor Because at this point, it’s basically taken everything Ford has had to do this Washington Post piece. She’s already gone further than she had anticipated going. The idea of flying to Washington, and giving testimony — that’s not something she’s ever really even contemplated. archived recording Deborah Katz is the attorney representing Christine Blasey Ford. Good morning. jodi kantor So the next morning, Debbie Katz is on a whole bunch of morning TV shows, and the hosts ask her the obvious question, which is, will your client testify? archived recording Ms. Katz, Is your client willing to testify before the Judiciary Committee? jodi kantor And Katz says — archived recording (debbie katz) The answer is yes. jodi kantor The answer is yes. michael barbaro Didn’t you just tell you that she wouldn’t testify? jodi kantor Well, it’s true that for Ford, the prospect of going to Washington at that point seemed unthinkable. But the lawyers and advisors essentially have two reasons. One, they feel they need to buy her time. They tell her that they need to keep her options open and that she can always back out later. Second, things have changed at this point, and they now feel that to kind of preserve the integrity of her story, she needs to tell it live. They’ve seen already privately that they think she’s going to be a very powerful, very credible witness, and they want her to tell that story unfiltered and unmediated to the American public. So essentially, they’re bluffing to preserve that option. So at that point, two different things are happening in public and in private. In public — archived recording Ford’s lawyers issued their latest salvo, telling the Senate Judiciary Committee that she wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety. jodi kantor The lawyers are beginning to negotiate with the Republicans for Ford to appear. And it seems like Ford is in some sense preparing to come to Washington. archived recording We’re going to hear for them hopefully, on Monday. I’m so glad it’s a public hearing, because I do think the public needs to hear from both sides. jodi kantor But in private, she’s sending her advisors notes like this. I’m feeling way too much pressure at the moment. megan twohey And Katz says, believe me I don’t want to be another pressure. I’m just cognizant of the time constraints, we need to get an email out to Grassley and Feinstein soon. jodi kantor Ford writes back, I can’t go there — she inserts a sad emoji — to D.C. megan twohey And Katz says, that’s O.K. We can always pull out on the basis that they wouldn’t come up with fair rules. This is the right next step. But the attorney really wants to make sure that she has the green light from her client to proceed with negotiations, so she says, to clarify, you’re O.K. with this sending the email which we need to do soon, but you want us to be clear that if they don’t agree to fair terms, you won’t go forward? jodi kantor And Ford writes back, I want you to know as you are writing that I can’t guarantee I’ll go to D.C. And she inserts an emoji with a bead of sweat. Can I see final version? And then she adds, I’m so scared I can’t breathe. archived recording We’ve seen Republicans, congressional Republicans, really lining up behind this idea that she needs to testify on Monday. You have Senator Jeff Flake saying that she needs to testify on Monday, Senator Collins saying that she needs to testify on Monday. jodi kantor But by Friday, September 21, the Republicans are losing patience. They announce that they’re going to go ahead and hold a vote the following Monday if a deal has not been reached for Ford to come. archived recording (mitch mcconnell) You’ve watched the fight. You’ve watched the tactics. But here’s what I want to tell you. In the very near future, Judge Kavanaugh will be on the United States Supreme Court. jodi kantor And so finally, over the weekend, a deal does materialize. By Sunday, Ford has committed to coming to Washington D.C. megan twohey And then within hours, the whole landscape changes again. jodi kantor So after all of these weeks of wondering whether other accounts are going to surface about Kavanaugh, two do at almost the same time. archived recording We have a second allegation of sexual misconduct against Judge Brett Kavanaugh this morning. jodi kantor The first is the story of Deborah Ramirez, which is published in The New Yorker. archived recording One of his Yale classmates tells The New Yorker magazine that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party about 35 years ago. jodi kantor It’s about a drunken incident at a party at Yale many years ago. It’s about Kavanaugh allegedly thrusting his penis in her face, even to the point where she had to touch it as she was pushing him away. At the same time, Michael Avenatti, the lawyer who’s become a very familiar public face because he’s represented Stormy Daniels, tweets out what sounds like very serious allegations against Kavanaugh. archived recording Accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of explosive instances of sexual misconduct. jodi kantor He says, we’re aware of significant evidence of multiple house parties in the Washington D.C. area during the early 1980s during which Brett Kavanaugh would participate in the targeting of women with alcohol and drugs to allow a, quote, “train” of men to subsequently gang rape them. Later on, it’s going to become clear that these two allegations are very different. But in that moment, they sort of seemed like a pair because they came into public view at the same time. megan twohey So what people had assumed would happen, that additional allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh would strengthen Ford’s accusation, and be evidence of a pattern did not happen. In fact, it was by many measures, the opposite. archived recording This new allegation is ridiculous. I mean, to accuse somebody of premeditated gang rape, which is what this Michael Avenatti client has done, it just doesn’t add up. It does not — megan twohey Where Ford’s accusation against Kavanaugh had pushed on some of those like unanswered confusing questions swirling around #MeToo, these new allegations pushed on those questions even harder. And so Republicans and other critics immediately pounced. archived recording (donald trump) 36 years ago, nobody ever knew about it, nobody ever heard about it? And now a new judge comes up, and she said, well, it might not be him, and there were gaps, and she said she was totally inebriated. megan twohey Now they’re coming out and they’re lumping all of these allegations together, and saying it’s all part of a political hit job by the Democrats to take Kavanaugh down. archived recording Take him down. Take him down at whatever costs. It is pure and simple — Raw politics at whatever cost. jodi kantor So it’s Thursday, September 27. It’s the day of the testimony. archived recording This morning, we continue our hearing on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as associate justice on our Supreme Court. jodi kantor Christine Blasey Ford has in fact shown up. archived recording Thanks, of course, to Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh for accepting our community’s invitation to testify. jodi kantor And there’s this mood across the country that something really important is going to be decided that day. And I think that was even truer inside the room. It felt like a tribunal. It was a much smaller space than the way it looked on TV. And the lights were so incredibly bright. Like, everybody was under a lot of scrutiny. And the two sides were just bumping up against each other. Tarana Burke was there, the founder of the #MeToo movement. Just a few feet away stood Ashley Kavanaugh, the judge’s wife. And she had this look of horror on her face. And even the way the testimony unfolded added to the impression that one side was going to win and one side was going to lose. archived recording (christine blasey ford) I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school. jodi kantor Christine Blasey Ford was very polite but she was also very firm. She was very precise. And many people found her enormously credible. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Mr. Chairman — jodi kantor But immediately afterwards, during Judge Kavanaugh’s turn — archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Ranking member Feinstein, members of the committee — jodi kantor He comes out swinging. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) This confirmation process has become a national disgrace. jodi kantor And he is vehemently denying any wrongdoing. Not just Ford’s allegation — archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Gangs, illegitimate children, flights on boats in Rhode Island — all nonsense. jodi kantor And he’s positioning himself as a kind of voice of male grievance about the #MeToo movement. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) This whole two week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit. jodi kantor So I wake up the next morning and I talk to Debbie Katz, one of Christine Blasey Ford’s lawyers. And she tells me to take a cab to the Watergate hotel in Washington. And we meet at the hotel, and she takes me into this little narrow conference room. And a minute later in walks Christine Blasey Ford. And all of a sudden, I’m face to face with this woman we’ve all watched so closely. michael barbaro And what was your impression? jodi kantor I mean, honestly, my strongest impression of meeting her the next morning is that this is just one person. She looked so everyday. Her hair was tousled from sleep, she was wearing flip-flops, the kind of dark suit she had worn the day before was gone. She was very focused on the practical questions of, O.K., how do I get home to California. Her flight was about to leave. She was trying to figure out, O.K., how do I resume a normal existence? So after Ford leaves, I continue to spend the morning with Debbie Katz and her law partner, Lisa Banks. And basically, they’re waiting like the rest of us. They’re waiting to see what the Senate Judiciary Committee is going to do. So we go back to their office, and we’re in a big conference room, and the TV is on, and they’re waiting for some sort of news development. archived recording Well, she got the opportunity to testify and have her life turned upside down, and for what? So that she could be placed on the court just like he would have been. jodi kantor Even though they’re at the center of this thing, they’re like the rest of us. They don’t know what’s going to happen next. archived recording If there’s a 16-year-old girl who in a few months who undergoes something similar, will she be encouraged to tell somebody because of Christine? Instead of keeping it to herself. She probably will be encouraged, but my question remains the same — to what effect? To what end? Is it going to change anything? jodi kantor So these two women have worked together on these kinds of issues for years. But as we’re sitting there in the conference room, they sort of adopt different positions. Debbie Katz plays the optimist. archived recording (debbie katz) If we’re evaluating where we are today versus where we were a year ago, there’s no question that a year ago, she would not be allowed to testified if not for the movement giving her support and insistent she be heard. archived recording (lisa banks) I’m not saying the movement is a failure, I’m really not. jodi kantor And Lisa Banks, her partner, kind of plays the pessimist. And she says — archived recording (lisa banks) Despite the power of the movement, and how everybody in this country has woken up, and recognize how women have been treated forever, right now, we’re awake to it. We’re energized, were mobilized. And yet because we have these institutions, the results seem to be the same. So maybe the message is different, maybe the messaging is different, they cover their ass in a different way. My problem is the result is exactly the same. And even after recent rounds the backlash, after Trump’s election, even after Harvey Weinstein, the #MeToo movement — jodi kantor The Senate hasn’t changed. The White House hasn’t changed. archived recording (lisa banks) And we have a Supreme Court — jodi kantor And that’s what matters. archived recording (lisa banks) And all of those entities will seek to see just maintain the status quo in terms of white male power and privilege. archived recording I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. megan twohey And by the next week, we have a much stronger sense of where this is headed. archived recording We need to form a protest and go to the polls, and protest and vote some of these people out, and vote for Republicans — megan twohey The display of rage that Kavanaugh had shown during his testimony had really given many Americans permission to voice their own discomfort and anger at where the #MeToo movement had gone. archived recording Today is Kavanaugh, tomorrow, it could be your brother, your husband, your father, or your son. I don’t like what I just saw here. Anybody can be accused of something. And even if they’re trying to defend themselves, you still want to make it wrong, and that’s not right. megan twohey You know, Mike Davis, who was the head Republican staffer on the Senate Judiciary Committee, later told me in interviews that Avenatti weighing in with the allegations of gang rape had been a gift — had been a gift. That this had provided you know, Kavanaugh’s defenders and people more broadly with the claims that this whole thing had gone too far, and that men were being unfairly accused, and targeted, and victimized. And so this is really the mood that’s taken hold on October 6, the day of the final vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination, when I’m in Washington D.C. with Lisa Banks and Debbie Katz at their office. And then we got in the car. And drove to Capitol Hill to watch the confirmation vote. archived recording (debbie katz) And you have this — I don’t know any trial lawyer who doesn’t have this. If I try a three week case, it takes me three weeks to the day to go through every single moment of what we could have done differently. megan twohey And it’s clear that they’re trying to find ways to make sense of this. archived recording (lisa banks) Whatever is happening in there today has been affected by what she has done. And we need to — even if the vote goes the wrong way, which it will, right? But the process has been affected and impacted. She did that and she deserves — archived recording As a reminder to our guests in the galleries, expressions of approval or disapproval are not permitted in the Senate galleries. megan twohey So we walk into the Senate gallery. You know, there are sort of big wooden doors, you walk down these white marble stairs. And soon, we’re all seated in this almost majestic Senate gallery. And Don McGahn, Trump’s White House counsel, is sitting across from me watching the proceedings with a smile on his face. archived recording A good man — a good man with sterling academic credentials — megan twohey And one by one, the Republicans are getting up and — archived recording But imagine what this has been like for a Judge Kavanaugh’s parents. megan twohey Talking about — archived recording Or his wife. megan twohey How Kavanaugh is such a victim. archived recording Or his children. megan twohey You know, Democrats are doing the exact opposite. archived recording The fact that this touched a nerve to so many Americans and particularly to women who have gone through this experience should put this whole debate in context. We ought to understand the gravity of this debate in light of the cultural change we are now facing in America. megan twohey And then in the end, the vote is taken, and — archived recording On this vote, the ayes are 50, the nays are 48. megan twohey It lines up almost to a T, Republicans in favor, Democrats against. archived recording And the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States is confirmed. megan twohey Kavanaugh has confirmed. michael barbaro So Jodi and Megan, it’s been a year since this day. We started this conversation by talking about where the country was in this moment, when Christine Blasey Ford learned that the man she said had sexually assaulted her in high school was being considered for the Supreme Court. You said that there were so many unanswered questions about the #MeToo movement when she learned that. In Kavanaugh’s confirmation and in the months since, have we answered any of those questions? jodi kantor No. It’s like we took all of these hard questions that were so heated to begin with, and we just poured a political gasoline on them, which is not a recipe for resolving anything. Look, I do think that there were some serious reassessment, especially on a private level, of long ago behavior. But did we move forward on solving any of these fundamental questions about #MeToo? I don’t think so. It’s like instead of causing progress the whole thing caused us to pull apart even farther. michael barbaro Why do you think that that is? jodi kantor It feels like when we look at the stories that have played out in the realms of entertainment, and corporate life, it feels like on those were capable of having a more nuanced forward looking discussion. In politics, these stories just become imbued with the heat and poison of American political life. And so it’s just very hard to come to any kind of resolution about them. megan twohey And these two individuals, Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, were turned into symbols by both sides. And yet they’re still symbols. Brett Kavanaugh is now on the Supreme Court. He was always going to be this visible conservative vote on the court. But now he’s going to be trailed by this cultural identity, a representation of male grievance. And Christine Blasey Ford, who went back to California with hopes of being able to return to a normal life, is far from it. It’s not certain if and when that will ever happen. And she is now seen as an icon by many women. She has been flooded with tens of thousands of letters from victims of sexual assault, and sexual harassment, and abuse who have poured their hearts out to her. But she’s also receiving death threats and is often scared to go out in public. And so she is the symbol that she never wanted to be and so is he. michael barbaro Megan and Jodi, thank you again. jodi kantor Thank you. megan twohey Thanks for having us. michael barbaro Here’s what else you need to know today. archived recording (donald trump) Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens. Because what happened in China is just about as bad as what I’ve been with Ukraine. michael barbaro On Thursday, President Trump called on China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family over work that Biden’s son did there. The remarks echoed Trump’s request to the president of Ukraine, already the subject of an impeachment inquiry, and could strengthen the Democrats’ case against the president. archived recording The president of the United States encouraging a foreign nation to interfere again to help his campaign by investigating a rival is a fundamental breach of the president’s oath of office. michael barbaro Speaking to reporters, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, one of the leaders of the impeachment inquiry, expressed outrage. archived recording It endangers our elections, it endangers our national security. It ought to be condemned by every member of this body, Democrats and Republicans. michael barbaro There is no evidence that Biden’s son did anything improper in China.

See you on Monday. While Senate investigators concluded at the time that Ms. Ramirez’s account lacked corroboration, the authors said at least seven people “heard about the Yale incident long before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge,” including Ms. Ramirez’s mother and two classmates who learned of it just days after the party.  The book also reports that Ms. Ramirez’s lawyers gave the F.B.I. a list of at least 25 people who may have had corroborating evidence, but that the bureau interviewed none of them. The two agents who interviewed Ms. Ramirez told her they found her “credible,” the excerpt said. The authors also said they uncovered a second, previously unreported incident involving similar behavior by Mr. Kavanaugh at a different party in his freshman year. The excerpt said that a classmate, Max Stier, who now runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about what he had witnessed but that the bureau did not investigate.  The excerpt cites two unnamed officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier, who has declined to discuss the episode publicly. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and that friends say she does not recall the incident. Justice Kavanaugh has declined to answer questions about it, according to the excerpt.  At the center of Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing was the testimony of sexual misconduct allegations by Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor who had attended a Washington-area high school near his. She testified that when they were teenagers, he pinned her to a bed, groped her and tried to remove her clothes while covering her mouth. He has denied the allegations from both women. Several of the Democrats seeking their party’s presidential nomination weighed in on the new allegations.  “These newest revelations are disturbing,” Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  wrote on Twitter  about The Times essay. “Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.” Kamala Harris, a Democratic senator from California and a member of the Senate committee that presided over his confirmation hearings,  on Twitter  echoed the call for impeachment. “He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice,” she wrote. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called the revelations “profoundly troubling” but stopped short of calling for Justice Kavanaugh’s impeachment. In a statement on Twitter, he called for an investigation into “whether the Trump Administration and Senate Republicans pressured the F.B.I. to ignore evidence.”  Julián Castro , who was housing secretary under President Barack Obama, and  Bernie Sanders , a senator from Vermont, also called for the justice’s impeachment.  Mr. Trump, who nominated Justice Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, defended him on Twitter on Sunday.  “He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY,”  he wrote . “Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!”  In another tweet , the president suggested that Justice Kavanaugh should “start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue.”  The Senate Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell,  said on Twitter  that the “far left’s willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year’s confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate.”  Ronna McDaniel , the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, wrote on Twitter that “The New York Times should be ashamed of this smear on Justice Kavanaugh.” James Dao, deputy editorial page editor for The Times, said in a statement that the essay was “a well-reported and newsworthy account that sheds new light on a matter that provoked significant national debate.” The Times was roundly criticized for a tweet — which was later deleted — made on its Opinion account on Saturday about the essay that read: “Having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn’t belong at Yale in the first place.” Mr. Dao said the tweet “was clearly offensive and never should have gone out and we sincerely apologize.” Chris Cameron contributed reporting.

"Antjuan Seawright and Lili Gil Valetta react. The  Democrats running for president  who quickly called for  Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s  impeachment over the weekend aren’t backing down – despite The New York Times issuing a  major revision  to its blockbuster story that ignited the demands in the first place. For the most part, those candidates are not even acknowledging the story update. Meanwhile, Rep. Jerry Nadler, the Democratic leader of the House Judiciary Committee, seemed to brush off his party's calls to begin proceedings against Kavanaugh,  saying on a radio show Monday : ""We have our hands full with impeaching the president right now.” NYT UPDATES KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' TO NOTE ACCUSER DOESN'T RECALL ALLEGED ASSAULT Many of the major 2020 Democratic candidates for president over the weekend released statements calling for Congress to impeach Kavanaugh, citing the Times' reporting of an uncorroborated and disputed college-era allegation of sexual misconduct as a reason to impeach. But late Sunday, the paper revised its portrayed blockbuster story to include the fact that several friends of the alleged victim said she told them she did not recall the reported sexual assault in question. But that didn’t prompt Democrats to revise or walk back their calls: In one case, billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer called for impeachment proceedings even after the Times’ update. “If the only way to get the truth is to launch an impeachment process for Justice Kavanaugh, I support starting that process immediately,” Steyer said Monday. Fox News has reached out to the Democrats who called for impeachment over the weekend to ask if the candidates have changed their position in light of the newspaper’s editors' note. None have responded yet. TRUMP SAYS KAVANAUGH BEING 'ASSAULTED,' JUDICIAL RECORD UNDER ATTACK WITH DISPUTED ALLEGATION California Sen. Kamala Harris – who said over the weekend that Kavanaugh “must be impeached – did not back down in a new tweet Monday, saying, “The reality of Kavanaugh's confirmation process is that it lacked any integrity — there has never been a meaningful investigation into these allegations. We need the truth.” The Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Clinton-connected nonprofit CEO Max Stier, ""saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."" The Times did not mention Stier's work as a Clinton defense attorney, or his legal battles with Kavanaugh during the Whitewater investigation. According to the Times, Stier ""notified senators and the FBI about this account"" last year during the Kavanaugh hearings, ""but the FBI did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly."" However, the Times' article also initially did not mention that Pogrebin and Kelly's book found that the female student in question did not recall the alleged episode. In its update, the paper later said, “Editors' Note: An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article."" Still, the earlier reporting ignited an avalanche of impeachment calls. Former HUD Secretary Julian Castro tweeted: ""It’s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter."" Said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren: ""Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."" KAVANAUGH 'MUST BE IMPEACHED,' TOP DEMS SAY, AS UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATION RESURFACES Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke said: “Yesterday, we learned of another accusation against Brett Kavanaugh—one we didn't find out about before he was confirmed because the Senate forced the FBI to rush its investigation to save his nomination. We know he lied under oath. He should be impeached."" Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., tweeted in part, ""This new allegation and additional corroborating evidence adds to a long list of reasons why Brett Kavanaugh should not be a Supreme Court justice. I stand with survivors and countless other Americans in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin."" South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said: “Kavanaugh should resign and if he doesn’t, the House should impeach him.” On Capitol Hill, the news prompted outrage from Democrats, but whether that could translate into another dramatic investigation remains to be seen. In his interview with the ""Brian Lehrer Show"" on Monday, Nadler suggested his committee is more focused on impeaching the president. But he signaled openness to at least reviewing allegations against Kavanaugh. Pressed by the host, Nadler ripped the FBI’s investigation of the allegations as a “sham” and said: ""It might fall under our jurisdiction. We'd have to take a look at that.” Others on the campaign trail raised concerns about Kavanaugh but didn’t explicitly call for impeachment. Former Vice President Joe Biden said: “This weekend’s report in the New York Times raises again profoundly troubling questions about the integrity of the confirmation process that put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court in the first place.” Sen. Bernie Sanders said he backed going after Kavanaugh by any legal means available: ""The revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable."" Sen. Amy Klobuchar stopped short of calling for impeachment, and instead posted a picture of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford with the words, ""Let us never forget what courage looks like."" CARRIE SEVERINO CALLS OUT NEW YORK TIMES' 'SHAMEFUL ATTEMPT TO REIGNITE SMEARS' AGAINST KAVANAUGH Conservatives have ripped into Democrats for their calls: ""This is the weakest of the weak type of allegations. It's really a shameful attempt to reignite these smears against Judge Kavanaugh that are utterly baseless,"" Carrie Severino, the founder of the Judicial Crisis Network who recently wrote a sympathetic book about Kavanaugh, said on ""Fox & Friends."" Trump, for his part, suggested Sunday that Kavanaugh should sue for defamation. Still, other Democrats ramped up their criticism of Kavanaugh on Monday. “It is unsurprising that Kavanaugh, credibly accused of sexual assault, would lie under oath to secure a Supreme Court seat,”  tweeted  New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “Because sexual assault isn’t a crime of passion - it’s about the abuse of power. He must be impeached.”   Fox News’ Gregg Re contributed to this report."

"Item: Last week Republicans in the North Carolina House used the occasion of 9/11 to call a surprise vote,  passing a budget bill  with a supermajority to override the Democratic governor’s veto. They were able to do this only because most Democrats were absent, some of them attending commemorative events; the Democratic leader had advised members that they didn’t need to be present because, he says, he was assured there would be no votes that morning. Item: Also last week, Representative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee,  issued a subpoena  to the acting director of national intelligence, who has refused to turn over a whistle-blower complaint that the intelligence community’s inspector general found credible and of “urgent concern.” We don’t know what the whistle-blower was warning about, but we do know that the law is clear: Such complaints  must  be referred to Congress, no exceptions allowed. On the surface, these stories may seem to be about very different things. The fight in North Carolina is basically about the G.O.P.’s determination to deny health care to low-income Americans; the governor had threatened to veto any budget that didn’t expand Medicaid. The whistle-blower affair probably involves malfeasance by high government officials, quite possibly President Trump, that in some way threatens national security. What the stories have in common, however, is that they illustrate contempt for democracy and constitutional government. Elections are supposed to have consequences, conveying power to the winners. But when Democrats win an election, the modern G.O.P. does its best to negate the results, flouting norms and, if necessary, the law to carry on as if the voters hadn’t spoken. Thus, in 2016 the voters of North Carolina chose a Democrat to govern the state; the immediate G.O.P. response was to try to  strip away  most of the governor’s power. Last year Democrats won a  majority of the votes  for the state legislature, too, although Republicans retained control thanks to extreme gerrymandering. But they no longer have a veto-proof majority — hence last week’s power grab. Similarly, last year America’s voters chose to give Democrats control of the House of Representatives. This still leaves Democrats without the ability to pass legislation, since Republicans control the Senate and the White House. But the House, by law, has important additional powers — the right to be informed of what’s going on in the executive branch, such as complaints by whistle-blowers, and the right to issue subpoenas demanding information relevant to governing. The Trump administration, however, has evidently decided that none of that matters. So what if Democrats demand information they’re legally entitled to? So what if they issue subpoenas? After all, law enforcement has to be carried out by the Justice Department — and under William Barr, Justice has effectively become just another arm of the G.O.P. This is the context in which you want to think about the latest round of revelations about Brett Kavanaugh. First of all, we now know that the F.B.I., essentially at Republican direction,  severely limited  its investigation into Kavanaugh’s past. So Kavanaugh was appointed to a powerful, lifetime position without a true vetting. [For an even deeper look at what’s on Paul Krugman’s mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.] Second, both Kavanaugh’s background and the circumstances of his appointment suggest that Mitch McConnell went to unprecedented lengths to create a Republican bloc on the Supreme Court that will thwart anything and everything Democrats try to accomplish, even if they do manage to take both Congress and the White House. In particular, as The Washington Post’s  Greg Sargent  notes, it seems extremely likely that this court will block any meaningful action on climate change. What can Democrats do  about this situation ? They need to win elections, but all too often that won’t be  sufficient , because they confront a Republican Party that at a basic level doesn’t accept their right to govern, never mind what the voters say. So winning isn’t enough; they also have to be prepared for that confrontation. And surely the first step is recognizing the problem exists. Which brings me to the Democratic presidential primary race. The leading candidates for the Democratic nomination differ considerably in both their personalities and their policy proposals, but these pale beside their differences from  Donald  Trump and his party. All of them are decent human beings; all would, if given the chance, move America in a notably more progressive direction. The real chasm between the candidates is, instead, in the extent to which they get it — that is, the extent to which they understand what they’re facing in the modern G.O.P. The big problem with Joe Biden, still the front-runner, is that he obviously  doesn’t  get it. He’s made it clear on many occasions that he considers Trump an aberration and believes that he could have  productive, amicable relations  with Republicans once Trump is gone. Which raises the question: Even if Biden can win, is he too oblivious to govern effectively? The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters  to the editor.

"The email, obtained by CNN, says Taylor Owings, Douglas Rathbun and Craig Minerva along with others across the department were selected to receive ""the Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service."" The award -- the department's second highest for employee performance -- is often given to employees who worked on key prosecutions.  News of the award comes amid renewed scrutiny of Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court last year as a new book is published that contains a previously unreported sexual misconduct allegation against Kavanaugh while a student at Yale. The victim declined to be interviewed by the book's authors, and her friend told the authors she does not recall the incident.  Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court was nearly derailed by allegations of sexual misconduct. Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor and the first accuser to come forward, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her at a party when they were both teenagers. He has denied all allegations against him. While  President Donald Trump has stood by Kavanaugh  -- as he did throughout his nominee's confirmation process -- some Democrats, including presidential candidates, are jumping on the wave of renewed scrutiny to call for Kavanaugh's impeachment. ""I sat through those hearings. Brett Kavanaugh lied to the US Senate and most importantly to the American people,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""He was put on the court through a sham process and his place on the court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice."" "

"The most effective presidential candidates are able both to energize their base and persuade the political middle. Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan and F.D.R. all did so. They managed to seem exciting to their party and yet also comfortable for swing voters. Senator Kamala Harris has the potential to pull off this trick. Her confrontational criticism of President Trump appeals to progressives, as does her relative freshness. Instead of being yet another aging white Baby Boomer, she’s a multiracial woman who’s younger than Obama. At the same time, her résumé defies some of the caricatures that Republicans use to make swing voters suspicious of Democrats. She is a tough former prosecutor. She was an executive who oversaw thousands of employees. For these reasons, Harris entered the campaign as a front-runner. Her  kickoff rally , in Oakland, drew a larger crowd than any other 2020 campaign event. Sure enough, her odds to win the nomination at one point in early summer, according to the  Predictwise  betting market, were almost as good as Joe Biden’s and Elizabeth’s Warren’s combined.  Then came Harris’s “summer slump.” That’s the term her campaign used, in an internal memo that an aide apparently left in a New Hampshire restaurant and  Politico  published. Since July, Harris has dropped in the polls, and her fund-raising has lagged. This weekend, Predictwise gave her an  8  percent chance of being the nominee, less than Bernie Sanders had. But I come to praise Harris today, not dismiss her. As the savvy political analyst  Sean Trende  wrote last week, she is the most natural politician in the field, and people are now underrating her chances. Last week, she had a good debate, from her opening statement directed at Trump to her stirring words about the dire peril of climate change — and our ability to overcome it. The first primaries, remember, are still months away, and many people are only now starting to follow the race. Notably,  a recent national poll  found that fewer Democratic voters have formed an opinion about Harris than about her main rivals. The history of presidential campaigns offers the same lesson: When The New York Times ran a front-page story about the “ mounting alarm”  among Obama’s supporters over his underdog campaign against Hillary Clinton, it was late October 2007. [ Sign up for David Leonhardt’s daily newsletter  with commentary on the news and reading suggestions from around the web. ] Harris remains an important candidate because the Democratic field remains flawed. And if you see Trump as a threat to America’s interests — which he is — you should at this point be rooting for as many strong potential nominees as possible. (That’s why I’d also welcome for a surge from  one  or  two  of the candidates way down in the polls.) Why do I think the field is flawed? Because Biden — who really does have swing-voter appeal — doesn’t look sharp right now. Sanders looks sharper, but his democratic socialism is  a bigger general-election risk  than the Bernie faithful acknowledge. Warren is running by far the best campaign, with a clear message that echoes the most consistently successful Democratic strategy of the last century: populism. Yet she still hasn’t shown enough instinct for appealing to the voters who swung from Obama to Trump and back to the Democrats in the 2018 midterms. Those voters  don’t want  their private health insurance taken from them. In the weeks ahead, I think Harris has two main jobs. First, she and her top advisers should be honest with themselves about her surprising penchant for mistakes. On Medicare policy, she has twice had to explain that she  didn’t mean  what she sure seemed to mean. On a radio show, she made a flippant remark about marijuana and Jamaica that her own father, who’s a Jamaican immigrant,  criticized . At a town hall, she  laughed  when a voter used a slur for the mentally disabled (to describe Trump’s agenda), and she later claimed that she hadn’t heard the words. There is a pattern here. Harris can be too quick to speak or react without thinking. It’s an understandable problem, because running for president is devilishly hard. But the way to get better at it — as past winners have done — is to avoid excuses and be ruthlessly (albeit privately) self-critical. Her second task is to develop a clearer theory of her campaign’s case. Obama’s was about hope and change. Warren wants to fight for the middle class. Harris stands for … what, exactly? It’s not always evident, not from her vaguely titled  book , “The Truths We Hold,” and not from her stump speech. When asked about this problem in  a recent interview , Harris rejected the poetry of campaigns and said, “I come at issues through the lens of how it actually impacts people.” That’s not good enough. It doesn’t help voters understand her values and priorities. Defeating Trump can be part of the answer. Her strong debate performance was based on rising above wonky internal party fights and focusing on him. But a negative case is not sufficient. If she is going to make a comeback, she needs a pithy positive case too. Over the last several months, I’ve had several Democratic voters tell me a version of the same story. They had just listened to Harris appear on television or a podcast, and they really wanted to like her. Yet she didn’t quite meet their expectations. They weren’t sure exactly who she was. In that apprehension is both the problem and the promise of the Harris campaign. She hasn’t won over Democratic voters. But many of them sure are open to her.

"In Houston on Friday, a day after the  third presidential debate , the Democratic frontrunner was asked by a reporter if he will be disclosing his medical records to address worries about his age. ""Yes,"" Biden said, then with a quip, ""What health concerns man? You want to wrestle?"" Asked about the timing, Biden said he'll release his medical records ""when I get the next physical"" exam and ""before there's the first vote."" A Biden spokesman confirmed to CNN that meant before the Iowa caucuses in February 2020. Biden had previously committed to releasing his medical records before the general election.  ""I mean there's no reason for me not to release my medical records,"" Biden told reporters Friday. Although the statesman would be the oldest US president to be sworn in for his first term,  Biden is not the oldest candidate in the race  for the Democratic ticket -- nor is he the only one in his 70s.  At 78, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is older than Biden. While Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is 70. Together with Biden, the three septuagenarians have been  dominating the field  of their younger Democratic rivals. Warren also plans to release her medical records before the Iowa caucuses, Kristen Orthman, a spokeswoman for the Warren campaign, confirmed to CNN. And a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign confirmed that the Vermont senator will release his medical records before the first votes are cast. NBC  first reported  Sanders' pledge.  Biden's propensity for gaffes and slip-ups, which is consistent with his previous campaigns, have been linked to his age by Democratic challengers and other critics. Biden has said that it's  ""totally appropriate""  for people to consider his age when evaluating him as candidate, though he has repeatedly assured that he's in good health and fine shape for the job.  If he were to win the White House, Biden would be 78 years old when he's sworn into office in 2021 -- which would make him the oldest president at the beginning of his first term in American history. Trump was the oldest president at the beginning of his first term in 2017. During the  third presidential debate  on Thursday, Julián Castro, 44, made what was seen  as an attack  against Biden's age by questioning Biden's memory.  Castro later denied  it was such an attack. After the debate, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said Castro had ""really legitimate concerns about can he be someone in a long grueling campaign"" and said that Castro ""has every right to call it out."" ""There's a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden's ability to carry the ball across the end line without fumbling,"" Booker told CNN's Anderson Cooper late Thursday night. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, another Democrat running for president but who was not on the debate stage Thursday,  recently said  Biden ""is declining"" and thought he didn't have the stamina, Bloomberg reported."
"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders sits down with Bret Baier following the debate. MANCHESTER, NH –  Facing discontent and unheeded warnings from longtime supporters that he could lose the New Hampshire primary , Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont  on Sunday replaced the director of his presidential campaign operations in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House The campaign broke the news on Sunday to more than 40 members of Sanders’ steering committee. The campaign announced that Joe Caiazzo was being replaced as state director. Shannon Jackson, who made the announcement, will replace him. Jackson ran Sanders’ 2018 Senate re-election campaign and was a senior adviser on the independent senator’s 2016 White House bid as well as the current campaign. SANDERS AND WARREN AVOID ATTACKS DURING DUELING EVENTS IN 'MUST WIN' NEW HAMPSHIRE “Thank God the campaign finally figured out they had to make serious changes in New Hampshire,” a longtime Sanders backer who attended the meeting told Fox News. The move comes as some Sanders supporters in New Hampshire are looking over their shoulders at  Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  - the other progressive standard bearer in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential candidates. 
      Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont speaks at the New Hampshire Democratic Party's annual convention, on Saturday September 7, 2019 in Manchester, N.H.
       Recent polls in the state have fluctuated. A live telephone operator survey from the  Boston Herald and Franklin Pierce University  indicated Sanders at 29 percent, overall front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden at 21 percent and Elizabeth Warren at 19 percent. But another recent poll suggested a three-way tie between the three top-tier contenders and a third suggested Sanders lagging behind Biden and Warren. SANDERS AHEAD OF BIDEN AND WARREN IN NH IN MOST RECENT NH POLL Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement on Sunday that ""we’ve built a great team in NH and are in a really strong position there. The campaign is now building out our operations to include Massachusetts and Maine state directors as we increase our focus in Super Tuesday states. We are running a 50 state campaign, taking no state or voters for granted and expanding our operations to secure the Democratic nomination."" Caiazzo was moved to one of those Super Tuesday states – Massachusetts. Caiazzo served as Sanders campaign’s 2016 state director in both Massachusetts and Rhode Island. But Shakir’s statement runs counter to what another steering committee member, who also asked for anonymity, emphasized. Pointing to the campaign, the supporter said “they didn’t listen to anything the steering committee suggested.” The supporter also lamented that some “Bernie backers” were going to Warren because the campaign “didn’t listen to them.” THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Sanders has repeatedly refrained from calling New Hampshire a “must win” state.  “This is obviously a very important state, as is Iowa, South Carolina. We’re working hard. We’re going to do many, many rallies around the state, and I’m feeling pretty good,” he said during a stop in the state on Labor Day. But, a veteran Granite State-based political scientist said the first primary state’s crucial to both Sanders and Warren. “New Hampshire is a must-win-or-place state for Senators Sanders and Warren,” said Wayne Lesperance, the vice president of academic affairs and a political science professor at New England College. “For both candidates, there is no better home-field advantage in the early states than the Granite State.” Sanders trounced Hillary Clinton in the state’s February 2016 Democratic presidential primary, launching the one-time longshot into an epic and marathon battle with the eventual nominee. Sanders’ support and organization in the state stayed very strong, even he ended his first White House bid. His steering committee has met monthly ever since the 2016 general election. But the 2020 race is a very different contest, and Sanders is now facing rivals who are preaching the same progressive policies that he first made mainstream in the Democratic Party four years ago. The transfer of Caiazzo to Massachusetts and of Jackson to New Hampshire came a day after the campaign parted ways with senior New Hampshire adviser Kurt Ehrenberg. GET THE FOX NEWS APP “From the very beginning there was clear and fundamental disagreement between Mr. Caiazzo and myself on how to run a successful presidential primary campaign in New Hampshire,” Ehrenberg told Fox News on Sunday. Ehrenberg, a longtime grassroots and labor organizer, set up the crucial New Hampshire organization for Sanders’ first White House bid from scratch in the spring and summer of 2015."

"Senator  Bernie Sanders  has overhauled his New Hampshire state operations five months before the primary, as his campaign fights to maintain support in a state he won by more than 22 percentage points in 2016. In a series of moves, the campaign has replaced the New Hampshire state director, Joe Caiazzo, with Shannon Jackson, who is a member of Mr. Sanders’s inner circle and who led the senator’s re-election campaign in Vermont last year. Mr. Caiazzo,  who was Mr. Sanders’s political director in Massachusetts and Rhode Island during the 2016 campaign , has been named state director in Massachusetts. The moves were announced to the campaign’s New Hampshire staff on Sunday.  “We feel really good about where we stand in New Hampshire right now,” said Faiz Shakir, the Sanders campaign manager. “The poll numbers, the volunteer capacity, the crowds that we have been getting at these events all suggest to us that we are in a very good position.” He added: “Obviously, much work to do to continue that trend.” The Sanders campaign also recently shook up its top leadership, promoting both Ari Rabin-Havt, the chief of staff, and Arianna Jones, the communications director, to the position of deputy campaign manager and bringing on a new senior communications adviser. [ Here are six takeaways from the September Democratic debate. ] Mr. Sanders’s campaign said the moves in New Hampshire and elsewhere are an attempt to expand his operations and organize supporters in the northeast as they look beyond the early states toward Super Tuesday, when several other New England states, including Senator Elizabeth Warren’s state of Massachusetts, will vote. The campaign recently hired a Maine state director, Ben Collings, a member of the Maine Legislature who ran Maine for Mr. Sanders’s 2016 campaign.  “This campaign is building up and spreading out over the next few months,” Mr. Shakir said.  But Mr. Sanders’s decision to shake up his campaign in first-in-the-nation New Hampshire, a state he almost certainly must win to have a chance at the nomination, underscores the challenges he faces in recreating the formula from his landslide victory there against Hillary Clinton. Without the same mix of New Hampshire’s anti-establishment and progressive voters all to himself this time, he has fallen into the 20s in most polls, bunched up with Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Ms. Warren at the top of the surveys in the state. The rise of Ms. Warren, in particular, has created difficulties for Mr. Sanders because, like him, she is from a neighboring state and, also like him, appeals to much of the party’s left. Potentially even more threatening, she represents a new alternative for the voters who were mostly aligned with Mr. Sanders in 2016 to oppose Mrs. Clinton.  What gets less attention, but which some New Hampshire Democrats say helps explain Mr. Sanders’s challenges there, are the long-shot candidates: Andrew Yang, a former tech entrepreneur, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Marianne Williamson, a best-selling self-help author,  are drawing attention from the sort of avant-garde voters  who had no such alternative options last cycle other than the Vermont senator.  New Hampshire Democrats said Mr. Caiazzo, who grew up in Massachusetts and last year ran the re-election campaign of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, was a traditional party operative and always something of an unusual fit for Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist whose campaign is about upending the establishment.  And increasingly, Mr. Sanders, in New Hampshire and across the country, is focused less on winning over traditional Democratic activists than he is in mobilizing volunteers as well as new supporters, particularly individuals who have not participated in past primaries, including independents and disaffected Republicans. New Hampshire Democrats also believe that Mr. Sanders did not have the sort of organization befitting the candidate who had won the state so overwhelmingly three years ago. Mr. Jackson, who was previously the Sanders campaign’s northeast regional director, has worked with Mr. Sanders for years, including in his senate office in Burlington, Vt. He also helped start Our Revolution, the senator’s political advocacy group. In a statement, Mr. Jackson said he was “honored to be taking on a more direct role in this critically important state” and praised the team there.

"The Working Families Party , the labor-aligned progressive group whose electoral influence has grown since the 2016 election, has endorsed Senator  Elizabeth Warren  of Massachusetts for the Democratic presidential nomination, a boon to her candidacy as she attempts to position herself as the main challenger to former Vice President  Joseph R. Biden Jr.   The party endorsed Senator  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont  during the last presidential cycle , at which time  he described Working Families as  “the closest thing” to “my vision of democratic socialism.” The group’s endorsement of Ms. Warren on Monday, one of the few by a prominent progressive organization this early in the primary, could turn heads among left-leaning Democrats desperate to defeat Mr. Biden, the more moderate front-runner, in a primary election where their party’s ideological future is at stake. “Senator Warren knows how to kick Wall Street kleptocrats where it hurts, and she’s got some truly visionary plans to make this country work for the many,” said Maurice Mitchell, the Working Families Party’s national director. “We need a mass movement to make her plans a reality, and we’re going to be a part of that work.” Mr. Mitchell brushed off the possibility that the group’s endorsement would be seen as a sign of a splintering of the progressive left. The vote among “tens of thousands” of party members and national committee leaders resulted in a commanding majority for Ms. Warren, a party spokesman said; she received more than 60 percent of the votes on the first ballot. But the announcement was met with derision from some of Mr. Sanders’s supporters. The national committee leaders — 56 people — held 50 percent of the voting power, with party members accounting for the other 50 percent. Several Sanders supporters called for the Working Families Party to release the full vote totals, which it has declined to do.  Mr. Sanders’s campaign  shook up its New Hampshire staff  over the weekend as Ms. Warren continued to make inroads among progressives. Ms. Warren is coming off a debate performance last week that was generally well received, and she held a rally in New York on Monday that drew thousands to Washington Square Park. Also on Monday, Ms. Warren unveiled a  plan to combat corruption in government , a core theme of her campaign. The plan is based on a wide-ranging anticorruption bill that she first proposed last year and is a cornerstone of her stump speech on the campaign trail. Mr. Mitchell and other Working Families Party leaders said in interviews that their endorsement came with a message to other progressive organizations. Rather than passively observe the primary, they said, these groups should choose a side and flex their organizing muscle during the early stages to help knock Mr. Biden off his perch. “If our focus is on victory, we can’t be delusional about it,” Mr. Mitchell said. “You don’t defeat the moderate wing of Democrats through thought pieces or pithy tweets, you defeat their politics through organizing.” Traditional bellwether endorsements from labor unions like American Federation of Teachers and the Service Employees International Union have not yet materialized, though Mr. Sanders  picked up an endorsement  from the United Electrical workers in August. With less than five months to go before the Iowa caucuses formally begin the nominating contest, many organizations are still wrestling with a sprawling Democratic field.  “There are some great arguments for progressives rallying around a single candidate as soon as possible and others for taking the time to see how the contest develops,” said Yvette Simpson, chief executive of Democracy for America, another progressive group that  endorsed Mr. Sanders  four years ago. Ms. Simpson said her group did not plan to endorse a candidate before December. Mr. Sanders finished second in the Working Families Party vote, ahead of three other candidates: the former housing secretary  Julián Castro , Senator  Cory Booker  of New Jersey and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York. Most national polls show a top tier of three candidates in the Democratic primary — Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders — and Mr. Biden has remained the front-runner.  Among the two leading progressive candidates, Mr. Sanders has traditionally enjoyed more support from working-class voters, helped by his name recognition held over from 2016. Ms. Warren has made significant gains in the last six months, but polling shows that most of that growth has come from college-educated voters.  In the years since President Trump’s election, candidates backed by the Working Families Party have won congressional, state and local races across the country, expanding the group’s power base from the Acela corridor to the West Coast. The group also helped several  left-wing candidates win seats  in the New York State Legislature last year. Mr. Mitchell took over as national director for the party in 2018, after he rose in prominence during the Black Lives Matter movement born out of protests in Ferguson, Mo. The group’s leaders stressed that, even with their endorsement, their intention was not to divide the progressive left between Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. The senators are longtime friends and have been publicly supportive of each other’s candidacies. But they are still locked in a battle to be the progressive standard-bearer. After the Working Families endorsement was announced on Monday, Misty Rebik, Mr. Sanders’s Iowa state director, wrote on Twitter: “There is one movement politics presidential candidate. One. It’s @BernieSanders.” Outside the left wing of the party, more moderate Democrats have continued to sound alarms about progressives’ ability to beat Mr. Trump,  and about Ms. Warren’s chances in particular . And many Republicans see the progressives’ embrace of a “Medicare for all” health care system and the Green New Deal as general-election liabilities waiting to be exploited. Surrogates for other Democratic contenders — like Mr. Biden, Ms. Harris and Mayor  Pete Buttigieg  of South Bend, Ind. — have tried to paint Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders as candidates of the elite, who talk about lofty ideologies instead of pragmatic solutions. “My concern about the vision from the Sanders-Warren approach is that it can polarize Americans, when we have other ways to deliver bold solutions without dividing the American people further,” Mr. Buttigieg  said Sunday  on CNN. But Mr. Mitchell said he believed the Working Families Party could convert Democrats skeptical of wide-reaching progressive policies. “I’m not worried about converting people who are already committed to a structural change agenda,” Mr. Mitchell said. “I’m worried about the people who are still trying to figure out where they land.” Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.

"If Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Elizabeth Warren are headed for a showdown, neither of them appears in a hurry to get there. The two candidates have seemed to be on a collision course for much of the last few months: Mr. Biden as the Democratic front-runner and de facto leader of the party’s moderate wing, with a steady but hardly dominant lead in polls, and Ms. Warren as his rising challenger, slowly trimming his lead and perhaps surpassing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont as the focal point of progressive energy in the race. Despite some pre-debate chest-thumping by Mr. Biden’s camp, no great clash occurred in Thursday’s debate in Houston, the first time he and Ms. Warren have been onstage together during the primary.  It is almost inevitable that the race will grow more combative, and in the wake of the debate there were signs that some of the leading candidates were ready for conflict. Mr. Biden, who only challenged Ms. Warren in a single exchange on health care Thursday, delivered a veiled swipe at her policy-heavy campaign at a fund-raiser on Friday, saying that the country needed not just plans but also “someone who can execute a plan.” And Mr. Sanders sought to reignite his own clash with Mr. Biden, releasing a statement from his campaign manager that accused Mr. Biden of “echoing the deceptions and falsehoods of the health care industry.” Ms. Warren, for her part, ignored the back-and-forth, seemingly content with a debate performance that her campaign said had presented her “like a president.”  Supporters of Mr. Biden claimed encouragement from what they called the best of his three debates, but his tendency to garble his words, and his dated instincts on sensitive matters of culture and race, are sure to be tested even more strenuously in the coming months. [ Here are six takeaways  from the September Democratic debate. ] Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, and Mr. Sanders are plainly unintimidated by Mr. Biden’s lead in the polls. While he has a solid electoral base, made up chiefly of moderates, older voters and African-Americans, he has not gained new support since he entered the race, and now appears vulnerable to defeat in at least three of the four early primary  and caucus states — Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada .   “The question is, who is trying to play a long game, against Biden and for the nomination,” said Dan Sena, a strategist who helped oversee the Democratic takeover of the House last year. Mr. Sena, who is now advising Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, a presidential candidate who failed to qualify for the Houston debate, suggested that Ms. Warren appeared satisfied with pursuing her own gradual and disciplined strategy. “My suspicion,” he said, “is that the Warren campaign in particular is looking at a much, much longer runway.” Among Ms. Warren’s goals in the near term are to consolidate her backing from liberals and expand her appeal to lower-income voters and minorities. Attacking Mr. Biden might not serve either goal. In the debate, Ms. Warren spent far more time highlighting her upbringing in a working-class Oklahoma family than engaging on any level with Mr. Biden. She must also still navigate the enduring presence of Mr. Sanders on the left. And Mr. Biden may have more immediate challenges. On Thursday night, he repeatedly expressed himself imprecisely — saying at one point that no nonviolent criminals should be in jail, when he meant to refer only to nonviolent drug offenders. He also referred to himself as the vice president of the United States, without appending the modifier  “former.” In a moment that drew criticism after the debate, Mr. Biden responded to a question about the legacy of slavery with a meandering answer that wound up involving a recommendation to place social workers in the homes of parents who “don’t quite know what to do.” Those parents, he suggested, might do well to “make sure you have the record player on at night” so that young children grow up hearing more words — a suggestion he has made more broadly at other times, though he does not typically allude to that particular technology. [ Sign up for our  politics newsletter  hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Mr. Biden’s obvious unsteadiness at certain moments opened the way for other candidates to question his strength as a challenger to President Trump. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, appearing on CNN after the debate, noted that Mr. Biden “tends to go on sometimes,” and depicted him as out of touch. “At one point, he’s talking about people in communities like mine listening to record players — I don’t remember the last time I saw a record player,” Mr. Booker said, adding, “There are definitely moments when you’re listening to Joe Biden and you just wonder.” Mr. Biden and his campaign surrogates have taken umbrage at suggestions that he has slipped in his political acuity, and on Friday they pushed back particularly hard on Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary, for having bitingly questioned Mr. Biden’s recall of his own policies in the debate. Mr. Castro, who is polling near the bottom of the field, was the only candidate to attack Mr. Biden in such strong terms, drawing backlash that illustrated why other candidates had shunned that approach. Asked by a reporter Friday whether he would release his medical records to address “concerns,” Mr. Biden, 76, said he would do so before votes are cast.  “What the hell concerns, man, you want to wrestle?” he said lightheartedly. He continued, “When I get the next physical. Look, I’ll release my — before there’s a first vote, that’s — I’ll release my medical records. There’s no, I mean there’s no reason for me not to release my medical records.’’ In Mr. Biden’s camp, there is a persistent sense that his rivals and the news media are underestimating him and giving him too little credit for the blocs of support he has already claimed. Whatever the flaws in Mr. Biden’s performance in Houston, there was no exchange in which an opponent obviously routed him, as Senator Kamala Harris of California did in the first debate and Mr. Booker did in the second.  He has faced many controversies throughout the campaign, his allies note, and he is still in the lead — a reflection, they argue, of the good will he enjoys from rank-and-file Democrats who feel that they already know him and who see him as best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump. Still, Mr. Biden may have exposed his anxieties about Ms. Warren in the one debate exchange that pitted him against her. He used his very first answer of the night to chide Ms. Warren for calling for the replacement of the Affordable Care Act with a “Medicare for All”-style system. Ms. Warren declined to swipe back; instead, she praised the A.C.A. but said it could be improved upon. [ Here’s the latest data  o n who’s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] Mr. Biden never went after Ms. Warren again. It was a more restrained performance than what several of his campaign surrogates had seemed to forecast, suggesting that he would question the pragmatism of Ms. Warren’s policies. Instead, the differences that emerged between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren arose largely by implication: the side-by-side contrasts between Mr. Biden’s manner of speech and Ms. Warren’s crisp, detailed answers; or between his proud ownership of the ideological middle and her refusal to be outflanked by other liberals. Allies of Mr. Biden pointed to the exchange over health care as an example of how he would draw contrasts with Ms. Warren and other candidates without becoming venomous. “He made clear that everybody knew about the differences in their two health care plans,” said Representative Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana Democrat and Mr. Biden’s campaign co-chairman. Asked about Mr. Biden’s aversion to making personal attacks onstage, Mr. Richmond said: “It’s not his style, he would never do that.” Indeed, Mr. Biden, who served for decades as a senator from Delaware, at times acted more like a man on the Senate floor than someone in a crowded presidential field, referring to Ms. Warren as his “ distinguished friend ” as he raised questions about her plan to pay for single-payer health care.  “There’s no pressure at this point for either one of them to go on the attack,” said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. “The potential downside is, frankly, much more likely than the upside.” The relative lack of engagement between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren may carry risks, too. For Mr. Biden, there is the chance that holding back against Ms. Warren could allow her to amass momentum that would make her harder to overcome later on. And for Ms. Warren, there is the possibility that her status as the challenger who is creating the most buzz could pass to a rival candidate — perhaps someone more eager to make the case against Mr. Biden directly. Kathy Sullivan, a former head of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, said it would be a mistake to write off the rest of the field in favor of the top two or three candidates. “I know people still want to focus on Sanders and Biden and Warren and say it’s a three-person race,” she said. “I don’t think that’s accurate. I think it’s a mistake and it would be unfortunate if people didn’t give all of these other candidates a good look, too.”"
