"HBO host Bill Maher tells 'Real Time' audience that he hopes Koch's end was painful; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' ""Real Time"" host  Bill Maher  said Friday that Democrats could be heading toward a contested 2020 convention and suggested that Sen.  Amy Klobuchar , D-Minn., could emerge as a strong ""compromise candidate."" ""Can I present a scenario?"" Maher asked his guests during the show's panel segment. ""I think this might be one of those years where ... they can't get over that 'centrist' versus 'socialist' thing. So  Elizabeth Warren  at some point takes Bernie's voters, he drops out. It's Warren and Biden. And they go into the convention and it's deadlock. This has happened before in American politics and they need a compromise candidate."" He then pointed to Klobuchar as a viable option for Democrats in the general election against  President Trump . MAHER MOCKS MSNBC'S 'NEVER TRUMPERS': THEY'RE 'VERY FAR LEFT' BECAUSE 'LOOK AT WHO'S GIVING THEM THEIR PAYCHECK' ""I'm looking hard at Amy Klobuchar,"" Maher said. ""You know why? Because -- this is not an insult to Amy Klobuchar -- I like you, but they put generic Democrat on the ballot, they win."" Plus, he added, ""She's a woman. That moves a lot with the wokesters."" Guest Krystal Ball of The Hill rejected Maher's argument, insisting a ""centrist"" would lead to another defeat for Democrats. She insisted that Sen.  Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., would beat Trump. Maher pushed back, saying, ""Even the centrists in the Democratic Party are pretty far left."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, Democratic strategist Fernand Amandi told Maher that a centrist is the wrong ""C-word"" and that it's actually ""charisma"" that matters most -- and stressed the Democratic candidate should have plenty of it. ""Well, we're f---ed then,"" Maher replied."
"Instead, the Massachusetts Democrat is running on a bill that she first signed on to in 2017: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' ""Medicare for All"" single-payer legislation. ""I'm with Bernie,""  Warren has said more than once  in recent months when asked about her vision for the American health care system. Warren's decision to wholly embrace another candidate's idea -- particularly on an issue of such outsized significance in the 2020 election -- has put her in an unfamiliar position of defending and advocating a proposal that is not uniquely hers. And she's made clear that she has no intention of authoring a comprehensive health care plan of her own during the Democratic primary contest. Warren has gone to considerable lengths in recent months to demonstrate unwavering support for Medicare for All, in one of the clearest signs of the political alliance forged between Warren and Sanders, even as they jockey for second place behind former Vice President Joe Biden. But there are early signs of the potential risks involved in Warren's full embrace of Sanders' signature proposal -- she's opened herself up to the familiar criticism that Medicare for All is too expensive, disruptive and unrealistic.  Those dynamics were on full display at Thursday night's presidential debate, when she was asked -- again -- whether Medicare for All would result in tax hikes for the middle class. Not for the first time, Warren pivoted.   ""Look, what families have to deal with is cost, total cost,""  Warren said on the debate stage , without directly answering the question about taxes. ""And the answer is, on Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations. But for hardworking families across this country, costs are going to go down, and that's how it should work under Medicare for All in our health care system."" Her argument is that in the aggregate, Americans will spend less on health care in a single-payer system, which would eliminate premiums paid to health insurance companies, along with deductibles and copayments. But questions about additional taxes for the middle class are not going away anytime soon, and would ramp up in intensity if Warren were to win the Democratic nomination. A Warren aide declined to comment on questions about whether there are plans for Warren to release a health care proposal of her own -- either during the primary or in the general election campaign -- as well as about middle-class tax hikes under Medicare for All, instead referring CNN to  Warren's remarks after Thursday's debate . Reassurance for progressives If Warren is confronting criticism from colleagues to the ideological right of her, the decision to take an unequivocal stance on Medicare for All has also had the effect of reassuring some progressive admirers. In interviews with CNN, activists who vocally back Medicare for All said Warren's recent ""I'm with Bernie"" positioning helped assuage concerns about her earlier, more circumspect, tone on Medicare for All. She has previously mused about ""different pathways"" to Medicare for All and spoken about other, less ambitious bills she had co-sponsored in the Senate. And asked by CNN's Jake Tapper at a town hall in March whether she supported eliminating private health insurance, as Medicare for All would effectively do,  Warren responded  that Sanders has ""got a runway for that."" ""I think we get everybody together. And that's what it is, we'll decide,"" she said. ""I've also co-sponsored other bills, including expanding Medicaid as another approach that we use."" Waleed Shahid, communications director for Justice Democrats, the group best known for helping to launch Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's successful 2018 campaign for a congressional seat from New York, said Warren's ""I'm with Bernie"" comments marked ""an incredibly important moment for her campaign."" ""I think many progressives were kind of confused and getting mixed signals from her on Medicare for All,"" Shahid said. ""That was a big moment for her to come out, pretty full-throated, for what's in the Bernie and (Washington state Rep. Pramila) Jayapal bills, which is a single-payer system."" Asked if Warren should roll out her own version of Medicare for All, Shahid argued that such a move might be counterproductive -- both for Warren and the single-payer movement. ""I don't think she needs to put out her own plan or anything like that,"" he said. ""In fact, putting out her own plan would be seen as competing with the existing bills that people have been rallying around and worked really hard on."" One of Warren's most ardent outside backers,  Adam Green of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, acknowledged  -- on the June night she said it -- that Warren's ""I'm with Bernie"" declaration on the debate stage ""gave anyone who prioritizes that issue a permission structure for clearly voting for her.""  Michael Lighty, a Medicare for All advocate and former director of public policy for National Nurses United, the first major union to endorse Sanders in 2016, was part of the push to build support in the Senate for the 2017 Medicare for All bill.  That included a sales pitch to Warren's office, which he said initially viewed it with some skepticism. ""Her staff gave the same consideration to that policy that she does to everything, which is pretty severe scrutiny, really,"" said Lighty, who is supporting Sanders again in 2020. Ultimately, though, Warren came around to the legislation, and was in the room next to her colleague from Vermont when it was ultimately unveiled on Capitol Hill. Still, Lighty said, there's a nagging question in the back of his mind. ""You have to ask, if Bernie's not there, what will she do? Because she says, 'I'm with Bernie,' and if Bernie is not there, what will she do?"" he said. ""So I think you have to ask those questions. I don't think I would consider her commitment and policy approach settled on Medicare for All."" Another front in the battle The simmering skepticism among some dedicated Medicare for All activists is also rooted in a less-talked-about health care battle.  Warren, along with fellow Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, pushed as recently as early 2018 for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act's tax on medical devices, an industry with a hub in the Bay State. The tax, which Republicans often targeted during Obama-era legislative standoffs over the health care law, was meant to help offset some of its new costs. A Warren aide noted to CNN that her support for repealing the tax has been contingent on lawmakers finding an appropriate source of alternative revenue. She has since become more vocal in her criticism of big pharmaceutical and insurance companies, railing against their multibillion-dollar profits at a time when millions of Americans can't foot the bill for life-saving drugs or coverage. And  in a video released last week  of her recent conversation on health care with Ady Barkan, a 35-year-old activist with ALS, Warren went a step further in assuring even the most hardline single-payer advocates. Barkan noted that Warren appeared to have become increasingly ""full-throated"" in her support of Medicare for All. ""My observation is that your political philosophical approach to a system failure is generally not to expand the size of the public sector, but to instead heavily regulate private sector actors and beat down their greed,"" Barkan said. ""Was that the source of your initial hesitation on the question of getting rid of private insurance, or was it something else?"" Warren gently pushed back, saying her concerns had more to do with the ""transition than on (the) end point."" But she then made a point that, for a candidate who so often argues that well-regulated markets can conquer corporate excess, amounted to a notable admission that health care was different. ""There are areas where markets just don't work, and a big part of health care is one of those,"" Warren said. ""So the idea that we'd get a couple regulations in place, and it'll all -- it'll all sort itself out, it's just not true with health care."""

"A slimmed-down Democratic debate dominated this week’s campaign news — but there were other developments, too. Here’s our weekly catch-up on the  2020 election  and the  Democratic field . A three-hour tour Former Vice President  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  walked into the debate at No. 1 in the polls — and squared off against Nos. 2 through 10 for the first time. To protect himself from incoming attacks, he brought a trusty shield: the legacy of former President Barack Obama. As our colleagues Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns wrote in  our debate overview , Mr. Biden “clung tightly to the legacy of the Obama administration” at the debate in Houston on Thursday, “as an array of progressive challengers, led by Senators  Elizabeth Warren  and  Bernie Sanders , brandished more daring policy promises and questioned Mr. Biden’s political strength.” But Mr. Biden also seemed steadier and better prepared than in previous debates. The nearly three-hour debate (really, it didn’t feel like a minute over two and a half hours!) had its share of memorable moments: Andrew Yang  promised  to give 10 families $1,000 a month for a year; Beto O’Rourke declared that,  “Hell yes,”  his administration would “take your AR-15, your AK-47”; Julián Castro  questioned  Mr. Biden’s ability to remember; Mr. Biden made reference  to a record player ; and Mayor Pete Buttigieg  described his experience  with coming out as gay. Our colleagues’ assessment of the night: The debate showed that time is running short,  and this race is getting testy . Just want some quick takeaways?  Here are six .  Here’s a look at  who experts said won the night . We also  tracked speaking time ,  fact-checked the candidates  and noted that issues like abortion and the gender pay gap  did not come up .  The next round will be bigger The next set of debates are in October, and yes,  they might once again be a set . The billionaire impeachment activist Tom Steyer qualified last weekend, meaning at least 11 candidates are set to participate,  and the Democratic National Committee could split the debate over two nights, Oct. 15 and 16, as a result. In addition to Mr. Steyer and the 10 candidates who debated on Thursday, two more — Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and the self-help author Marianne Williamson — could conceivably qualify. Both have reached the 130,000-donor threshold needed, but Ms. Gabbard only has two qualifying poll results and would need two more by Oct. 1, and Ms. Williamson would need three. Oh, and one other thing:  The New York Times will be one of the debate hosts .  A window into New Hampshire In non-debate news, 19 of the Democratic candidates assembled in New Hampshire for a party convention last weekend. The daylong event served as a test — if an imperfect one — of the New Hampshire primary electorate. What did we learn? Our colleague Katie Glueck was on the ground in Manchester and reported that while several candidates got enthusiastic receptions, no one was embraced quite like Ms. Warren. Read more about  the convention here . Another Republican will challenge Trump Former Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina entered the Republican primary last weekend, criticizing President Trump’s economic stewardship and questioning the financial ethics of his administration. Mr. Sanford, who is also a former congressman, told Alex Burns that he believed Mr. Trump’s popularity was “certainly wide, but perhaps much thinner and much more fragile than people realize.”  As a reminder: Former Representative  Joe Walsh  of Illinois, a one-term congressman turned talk radio provocateur, and former Gov.  William F. Weld  of Massachusetts, who ran for vice president in 2016 on the Libertarian Party ticket, are also running against Mr. Trump.  You can read  the rest of our interview with Mr. Sanford here .  Harris releases long-awaited criminal justice plan; Warren seeks to expand social security  On Monday, Senator  Kamala Harris  of California released a sweeping proposal to overhaul the criminal justice system. Ms. Harris, a former prosecutor, vowed to end mass incarceration and revamp police practices through a progressive wish list of policies, including some ideas she had previously rejected as a district attorney and state attorney general.  The plan  represents perhaps the most ambitious effort of her campaign so far.  Ms. Warren unveiled a plan on Thursday that would give all recipients of Social Security benefits an extra $200 per month.  The plan  would fundamentally alter the funding structure of the program, forcing the very rich to pay much more into Social Security in taxes than they would get out of it in benefits, while most Americans would get far more than they pay in. Read more about  Ms. Harris’s criminal justice plan  and  Ms. Warren’s Social Security plan . In other policy news:  Mr. O’Rourke  called on banks and credit card companies to address gun violence  by refusing to provide services for some firearms sales. In what may be a campaign first, Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio released  a “policy album”  on Spotify, which he titled “A New and Better Agenda.” And finally … Several memes emerged from Thursday’s debate, so we thought we’d share a few. There were a variety of  reactions to Mr. Yang’s free-money play . Some criticism was  aimed at Mr. Castro over his attack on Mr. Biden . And  The Onion  noted Ms. Williamson’s absence from the stage. But  fans of Ms. Williamson  need not despair — she  live-streamed  her own “post-debate commentary” Thursday night."
"Raymond Arroyo breaks down his Democratic debate edition of 'Friday Follies.' Remember the exciting, unpredictable and entertaining 2015-16  Republican  presidential debates?  Who would candidate  Donald Trump  take down this week?  How would he dominate media questioners yet again? Whether you were for Trump, appalled by him or just curious, each debate was worth watching. DEBATE DESCENDS INTO MELEE OVER HEALTH CARE, OBAMA, SOCIALISM AS DEMS STRUGGLE TO SHOW UNITY Trump was so different – and so cheerfully direct and aggressive – that people began to see the debates as a sort of reality TV (which is what they should be). Our country is better when more people want to watch political debates and participate in elections. By contrast, Thursday’s Democratic debate was a bore, with an old-time politician tone that made it painful to sit through. After about 30 minutes of policy-wonk jargon about incomprehensible details of health policy, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., remarked: ""This discussion has given the American people a headache."" Like or dislike Trump, I can’t imagine a participant in a Trump-energized presidential debate saying – as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg did – that the debates ""are becoming unwatchable."" The most revealing moment of the debate may have been former Vice President Joe Biden’s comment that to help poor children learn more words, parents should “make sure you have the record player on at night.” CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER It may be tricky for Democrats if they nominate someone in  2020  who is mentally in a world of record players. It will be quite difficult to try to be the party of the future when you have a candidate of the past. Similarly, the more radical candidates – virtually everyone other than the two semi-moderates, Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. – seemed to be in a contest to alienate the most Americans. Just in case the talk about ""Medicare-for-all,"" getting rid of private insurance, defunding charter schools and the usual left-wing radicalism wasn’t enough, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas set the classic example of driving away voters and alienating entire regions of the country. Similarly, the more radical candidates – virtually everyone other than the two semi-moderates, Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. – seemed to be in a contest to alienate the most Americans. When debate moderator David Muir of ABC News questioned O’Rourke about his recent comments about firearms bans and confiscations, Muir asked bluntly: ""Are you proposing taking away their guns?"" Apparently, O’Rourke wanted to make absolutely certain that the millions of law-abiding Americans who own guns would understand that his candidacy was a mortal threat to their freedom and Second Amendment rights. ""Hell, yes, we're going to take away your AR-15, your AK-47,"" O'Rourke said. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also reminded millions of Americans about her elitist isolation from most people when she said: ""I've actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company."" Warren’s comment is quite revealing since the  Kaiser Family Foundation  reported that 58 percent of Americans oppose a health care policy plan that would force them to give up the private insurance option. Only 37 percent favored getting rid of all private health insurance. Meanwhile, support for “Medicare-for-all” continues to drop when Americans’ are told it would raise their taxes (37 percent), threaten the current Medicare program (32 percent), and cause delays in treatment (26 percent). CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Warren, of course, represents the 37 percent. President Trump would (and will) be happy to defend the 58 percent.

"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 14 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com BFFs in D.C.? Apparently not U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and  Kamala Harris  of California. According to reports, Feinstein, the senior senator from the Golden State, will throw a fundraiser next month for  Democratic 2020 presidential  frontrunner  Joe Biden  -- and not for Harris, another White House contender whose poll numbers suggest she could probably use some high-profile help. Feinstein and husband Richard Blum will co-host the Biden event Oct. 3 in San Francisco, according to a copy of the invitation obtained by CNBC. Feinstein first gave her backing to Biden in January, months before the former vice president made his campaign official in April.  FEINSTEIN BACKING BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT, SNUBBING FELLOW CALIFORNIAN KAMALA HARRIS: REPORT “My candidate would be Joe Biden,” Feinstein told CNBC back then. “I watched him as vice president. I’ve seen him operate. I’ve seen him perform and I think he brings a level of experience and seniority, which I think is really important.” The early evening reception will be the first that Feinstein hosts for Biden in the 2020 election,  CNBC  reported. Her husband has already participated in several fundraising events for Biden, who campaigned for Feinstein in 2018, when she was re-elected by a landslide.  Feinstein has repeatedly faced questions about why she prefers Biden -- who was her Senate colleague for nearly two decades -- over Harris, her home state’s junior senator. Harris and Biden famously butted heads during Democratic presidential debate earlier this year when Harris challenged Biden’s stance decades ago on the issue of desegregation school busing when he was a U.S. senator from Delaware. “She’s brand-new here,” Feinstein told the  Los Angeles Times  about Harris in January when asked if she would support a Harris run for the White House. “It takes a little bit of time to get to know somebody.” She also told the Washington Examiner in May when Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee he made her the “first woman” to serve on the panel. “I love Kamala, I appreciate her,” Feinstein said, “but that’s what I’m going to do. I feel very loyal to him."" Ticket prices begin at $1,000 and cap out at $2,800 per person for the October event.

"If Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Elizabeth Warren are headed for a showdown, neither of them appears in a hurry to get there. The two candidates have seemed to be on a collision course for much of the last few months: Mr. Biden as the Democratic front-runner and de facto leader of the party’s moderate wing, with a steady but hardly dominant lead in polls, and Ms. Warren as his rising challenger, slowly trimming his lead and perhaps surpassing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont as the focal point of progressive energy in the race. Despite some pre-debate chest-thumping by Mr. Biden’s camp, no great clash occurred in Thursday’s debate in Houston, the first time he and Ms. Warren have been onstage together during the primary.  It is almost inevitable that the race will grow more combative, and in the wake of the debate there were signs that some of the leading candidates were ready for conflict. Mr. Biden, who only challenged Ms. Warren in a single exchange on health care Thursday, delivered a veiled swipe at her policy-heavy campaign at a fund-raiser on Friday, saying that the country needed not just plans but also “someone who can execute a plan.” And Mr. Sanders sought to reignite his own clash with Mr. Biden, releasing a statement from his campaign manager that accused Mr. Biden of “echoing the deceptions and falsehoods of the health care industry.” Ms. Warren, for her part, ignored the back-and-forth, seemingly content with a debate performance that her campaign said had presented her “like a president.”  Supporters of Mr. Biden claimed encouragement from what they called the best of his three debates, but his tendency to garble his words, and his dated instincts on sensitive matters of culture and race, are sure to be tested even more strenuously in the coming months. [ Here are six takeaways  from the September Democratic debate. ] Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, and Mr. Sanders are plainly unintimidated by Mr. Biden’s lead in the polls. While he has a solid electoral base, made up chiefly of moderates, older voters and African-Americans, he has not gained new support since he entered the race, and now appears vulnerable to defeat in at least three of the four early primary  and caucus states — Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada .   “The question is, who is trying to play a long game, against Biden and for the nomination,” said Dan Sena, a strategist who helped oversee the Democratic takeover of the House last year. Mr. Sena, who is now advising Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, a presidential candidate who failed to qualify for the Houston debate, suggested that Ms. Warren appeared satisfied with pursuing her own gradual and disciplined strategy. “My suspicion,” he said, “is that the Warren campaign in particular is looking at a much, much longer runway.” Among Ms. Warren’s goals in the near term are to consolidate her backing from liberals and expand her appeal to lower-income voters and minorities. Attacking Mr. Biden might not serve either goal. In the debate, Ms. Warren spent far more time highlighting her upbringing in a working-class Oklahoma family than engaging on any level with Mr. Biden. She must also still navigate the enduring presence of Mr. Sanders on the left. And Mr. Biden may have more immediate challenges. On Thursday night, he repeatedly expressed himself imprecisely — saying at one point that no nonviolent criminals should be in jail, when he meant to refer only to nonviolent drug offenders. He also referred to himself as the vice president of the United States, without appending the modifier  “former.” In a moment that drew criticism after the debate, Mr. Biden responded to a question about the legacy of slavery with a meandering answer that wound up involving a recommendation to place social workers in the homes of parents who “don’t quite know what to do.” Those parents, he suggested, might do well to “make sure you have the record player on at night” so that young children grow up hearing more words — a suggestion he has made more broadly at other times, though he does not typically allude to that particular technology. [ Sign up for our  politics newsletter  hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Mr. Biden’s obvious unsteadiness at certain moments opened the way for other candidates to question his strength as a challenger to President Trump. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, appearing on CNN after the debate, noted that Mr. Biden “tends to go on sometimes,” and depicted him as out of touch. “At one point, he’s talking about people in communities like mine listening to record players — I don’t remember the last time I saw a record player,” Mr. Booker said, adding, “There are definitely moments when you’re listening to Joe Biden and you just wonder.” Mr. Biden and his campaign surrogates have taken umbrage at suggestions that he has slipped in his political acuity, and on Friday they pushed back particularly hard on Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary, for having bitingly questioned Mr. Biden’s recall of his own policies in the debate. Mr. Castro, who is polling near the bottom of the field, was the only candidate to attack Mr. Biden in such strong terms, drawing backlash that illustrated why other candidates had shunned that approach. Asked by a reporter Friday whether he would release his medical records to address “concerns,” Mr. Biden, 76, said he would do so before votes are cast.  “What the hell concerns, man, you want to wrestle?” he said lightheartedly. He continued, “When I get the next physical. Look, I’ll release my — before there’s a first vote, that’s — I’ll release my medical records. There’s no, I mean there’s no reason for me not to release my medical records.’’ In Mr. Biden’s camp, there is a persistent sense that his rivals and the news media are underestimating him and giving him too little credit for the blocs of support he has already claimed. Whatever the flaws in Mr. Biden’s performance in Houston, there was no exchange in which an opponent obviously routed him, as Senator Kamala Harris of California did in the first debate and Mr. Booker did in the second.  He has faced many controversies throughout the campaign, his allies note, and he is still in the lead — a reflection, they argue, of the good will he enjoys from rank-and-file Democrats who feel that they already know him and who see him as best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump. Still, Mr. Biden may have exposed his anxieties about Ms. Warren in the one debate exchange that pitted him against her. He used his very first answer of the night to chide Ms. Warren for calling for the replacement of the Affordable Care Act with a “Medicare for All”-style system. Ms. Warren declined to swipe back; instead, she praised the A.C.A. but said it could be improved upon. [ Here’s the latest data  o n who’s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] Mr. Biden never went after Ms. Warren again. It was a more restrained performance than what several of his campaign surrogates had seemed to forecast, suggesting that he would question the pragmatism of Ms. Warren’s policies. Instead, the differences that emerged between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren arose largely by implication: the side-by-side contrasts between Mr. Biden’s manner of speech and Ms. Warren’s crisp, detailed answers; or between his proud ownership of the ideological middle and her refusal to be outflanked by other liberals. Allies of Mr. Biden pointed to the exchange over health care as an example of how he would draw contrasts with Ms. Warren and other candidates without becoming venomous. “He made clear that everybody knew about the differences in their two health care plans,” said Representative Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana Democrat and Mr. Biden’s campaign co-chairman. Asked about Mr. Biden’s aversion to making personal attacks onstage, Mr. Richmond said: “It’s not his style, he would never do that.” Indeed, Mr. Biden, who served for decades as a senator from Delaware, at times acted more like a man on the Senate floor than someone in a crowded presidential field, referring to Ms. Warren as his “ distinguished friend ” as he raised questions about her plan to pay for single-payer health care.  “There’s no pressure at this point for either one of them to go on the attack,” said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. “The potential downside is, frankly, much more likely than the upside.” The relative lack of engagement between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren may carry risks, too. For Mr. Biden, there is the chance that holding back against Ms. Warren could allow her to amass momentum that would make her harder to overcome later on. And for Ms. Warren, there is the possibility that her status as the challenger who is creating the most buzz could pass to a rival candidate — perhaps someone more eager to make the case against Mr. Biden directly. Kathy Sullivan, a former head of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, said it would be a mistake to write off the rest of the field in favor of the top two or three candidates. “I know people still want to focus on Sanders and Biden and Warren and say it’s a three-person race,” she said. “I don’t think that’s accurate. I think it’s a mistake and it would be unfortunate if people didn’t give all of these other candidates a good look, too.”"
"The plan will cost approximately $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years, the Vermont independent said during a speech in Las Vegas, acknowledging that it is ""expensive.""  Sanders said he will call for a national rent control standard, ""capping annual rent increases throughout the country at no more than one and a half times the rate of inflation or three percent, whichever is higher,"" he said.  Sanders did not offer specifics on how he would pay for the plan aside from raising taxes on ""the top one-tenth of one percent"" of American households. He stressed that under his housing proposal, ""99.9 percent of Americans will not see their taxes go up by one nickel."" He noted that his late mother's dream -- that their family would move out of their rent-controlled Brooklyn apartment and into their own home -- never happened. ""But during her life, at least our family was always able to afford a roof over our heads, because we were living in a rent-controlled building, which meant that for our family and all the other families in our building, rents could not be arbitrarily raised,"" he said. Sanders also announced that he will expand the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund and create an additional two million units of mixed-income housing, which he said would ""create many, many good-paying union jobs.""  He would fully fund the Section 8 rental assistance program and establish anti-discrimination protections for program recipients against landlords, he said. Sanders called to invest more than $32 billion over the next five years to address homelessness, $70 billion to repair and grow public housing, and $50 billion in state and local grants to create community land trusts. He also called for empowering localities ""to go even further to protect tenants from the skyrocketing price of housing"" and to ""require real estate developers to include affordable housing in the construction of new developments."""

"But a deeply personal moment on the campaign trail Friday spoke to how much the issue of affordable health care affects Americans.  Fresh from the Democratic debate , the Vermont senator began his two-day swing in Nevada with a town hall, where people opened up and got intensely personal about their issues with health care. During the Friday event in Carson City, a Navy veteran named John shared with Sanders that he is $139,000 in debt because his health insurance, Tricare, a program for the military, is no longer accepted.  Sanders listened intently as John, who said he served 20 years in the military, revealed that he has been diagnosed with stage four Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder.  When asked by Sanders how he is going to pay off his debt, John said, raising his voice, ""I can't, I can't, I'm gonna kill myself."" The senator cut him off -- ""Hold it. John, stop it. You're not gonna kill yourself. Stop it,"" Sanders said. ""I can't do this,"" John said with frustration in his voice. ""I have Huntington's disease. Do you know how hard it is? You know, you probably don't, do you? I can't drive. I can barely take care of myself."" ""Alright, let's chat later at the end of the meeting, okay?"" Sanders said to John. As promised, Sanders and his wife Jane spoke with John after the campaign event ended. Sanders shared with CNN that in this conversation with the veteran, he made sure his team got the correct contact information. ""What I wanted to make sure is that I got the correct information because what I did not want to happen is just him talking about his story but not being able to follow up with him,"" Sanders said.  ""He told me he doesn't answer his phone very much because there are bill collectors calling him up every day,"" Sanders said of what he learned when speaking with the veteran further. Sanders also shared that his team has already gotten in touch with one of the Nevada senators about this veteran's situation.  ""We have already been in contact with one of the Nevada senators. We're going to get in touch with the entire Nevada Congressional delegation to get him the help that he needs,"" the Vermont senator said.   ""We will follow up on Monday,"" Sanders later added. ""Here is somebody who put his life on the line to defend this country, a veteran, dealing with a terrible, terrible illness, and what was obviously very unsettling is when he used the word suicide,"" Sanders told CNN when reflecting on his interaction. ""That was the most dramatic and painful moment of the whole town meeting,"" he added. ""This should not be going on in America, not for a veteran, not for any person in this country, and it is beyond comprehension that under the current healthcare system, somewhere like a half a million people go bankrupt every year because of medical bills,"" Sanders told CNN.  ""Clearly we are not doing what we should be doing to make sure that every veteran in this country gets all of the quality healthcare they need when they need it,"" he said. If you or a veteran you know needs help, call the Veterans Crisis Line at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), and press 1."

"Democratic 2020 candidates slam President Trump as a racist at presidential debate in Houston; reaction from Fox News contributor Deroy Murdock, syndicated columnist and contributing editor for National Review Online. “ Donald Trump  is a racist.” Democrats deploy this lie more often than commas and periods. Look no further than Thursday’s Democratic  presidential  debate in Houston. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey declared: “We know Donald Trump’s a racist, but there is no red badge of courage for calling him that.” He claimed that America has “a president that [sic] can’t condemn white supremacy.” MARK LEVIN RIPS 2020 DEM FIELD AS 'WEAKEST CANDIDATES I'VE EVER SEEN': 'SO IMMATURE -- ALL OF THEM' “Anyone who supports this [President Trump’s immigration policies] is supporting racism,” said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. “The only people, though, who actually buy into this president’s hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who don’t know any.” Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas shouted: “We have a white supremacist in the White House, and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country.” “President Trump, you’ve spent the last two-and-a-half years full-time trying to sow hate and division among us,” Sen. Kamala Harris of California hectored, “and that is why we’ve gotten nothing done.” These and other Democrats deliberately ignore the 25 or more instances in which Trump condemned racism, denounced white nationalism, attacked anti-Semitism, applauded Jews, embraced blacks, praised Muslims, and preached national unity and love among Americans, from coast to coast. I repeatedly have documented these statements, events, and actions in tremendous detail, most recently in a piece in the  National Review. Just last Tuesday, Trump addressed the 2019 National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week Conference at Washington’s Renaissance Hotel. The president did not merely breeze by for a photo op. He spent a full 30 minutes speaking with black educators and detailing his policies to assist scholars, professors and administrators at these 101 public and private campuses – most with large, if not majority, black student bodies. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER “For more than 180 years, HBCUs have strengthened our country and called America to greatness,” Trump said. “Your institutions have been pillars of excellence in higher education and the engines of advancement for African-American citizens.” Trump celebrated distinguished HBCU alumni, including such noted Americans as educator Booker T. Washington, the Tuskegee Airmen who helped win World War II, civil rights leaders Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr., Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and others. Trump specified the steps that he and his administration have taken to advance HBCUs, including the following: Many HBCU students attend summer school. HBCU presidents appealed to President Barack Obama for eight years to allow year-round Pell Grants for college students. Obama didn’t lift a finger. Trump approved this in less than two years and gave HBCU students fresh financial aid options. Trump added: “I signed legislation to increase federal funding for HBCUs by a record 13 percent.” (Fiscal hawks might bristle at that number, but no one can call such a spending hike bigoted.) The Trump administration forgave the debts of Dillard, Xavier and other New Orleans-area HBCUs, which have struggled since the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. The White House has pressed NASA to recruit HBCU students interested in space careers. The Departments of Labor and Education are collaborating with HBCUs to expand apprenticeships for their students. Forty students have been chosen as the 2019 White House HBCU Competitiveness Scholars. In his fifth week in office, Trump explained: “I signed an executive order to move the federal HBCU initiative to the White House, right where it belongs.” These and other Democrats deliberately ignore the 25 or more instances in which Trump condemned racism, denounced white nationalism, attacked anti-Semitism, applauded Jews, embraced blacks, praised Muslims, and preached national unity and love among Americans, from coast to coast. These and other pro-HBCU reforms unfold just steps away from the Oval Office, not in some far-flung federal outpost. Beyond this, Trump repeatedly spoke about national unity, including when he said: “Every day of my presidency, we’ll strive to give every child, of every background and every race, religion and creed, the best chance to reach that beautiful American Dream.” These are the words of a racist? Naturally, this huge story generated tremendous attention among the Old Guard media. Wrong! Trump’s half-hour address garnered exactly zero minutes and zero seconds of coverage on that night’s ABC, CBS and NBC evening news programs. Alas, Trump stomped on his own potential HBCU headlines by firing National Security Adviser John Bolton via Twitter at 11:58 a.m., just two-and-a-half hours before his speech. Still, despite that major development, ABC, CBS and NBC could have spared a moment or two to mention Trump’s HBCU presentation, at least fleetingly. After all, the networks somehow found time for such urgent developments as ABC’s 15 seconds on the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders doubling their pay, CBS’ 22 seconds on the health benefits of twice-weekly naps, and NBC’s one minute and 34 seconds on a 9-year-old Ohio boy who was “lunch-shamed” on his birthday. “The national news media have no interest in highlighting any facts which might undermine the ‘Trump is a racist’ narrative,” the Media Research Center’s Brent Baker observed. MRC kindly furnished this statistical confirmation of the networks’ irresponsible public affairs coverage. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Tuesday afternoon, Trump reached out to blacks – as he has many times before. On cue, the media buried the story. And, playing their part perfectly, top Democrats two days later screamed: “RACIST!” This is exactly why America is choking on the poison of division. And the corrupt fake news media are right in the middle of this “DJT = KKK” venom – pumping it out by the gallon. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY D EROY MURDOCK"
"Political analyst Ron Meyer and Democratic strategist Jason Nichols react to the Democratic debate. Former Vice President Joe Biden  and  Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , have kept up their debate over health care following their spat during Thursday night's Democratic debate, with Biden accusing Sanders of effectively handing Americans a pay cut and Sanders accusing Biden of distorting the socialist's ""Medicare-for-all"" plan. ""I do not doubt the motives of either of the two leaders on the issue of Medicare-for-all. I don't doubt their motives,"" Biden said in Houston Friday while discussing Sanders and  Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , ""but it’s going to cost over $3.4 trillion dollars a year just to fund Medicare. $3.4 trillion a year. ""That is twice the entire federal budget save interest on the debt. And so how do you do that without raising taxes? There's not enough taxes to cut -- eliminate tax breaks for the wealthy -- there's not enough out there to get you there,"" he added. Biden, the frontrunner, has faced criticism from multiple candidates for wanting to build on the Affordable Care Act rather than advocating a larger, single-payer program like  Medicare-for-all. BIDEN MOCKS SANDERS: 'FOR A SOCIALIST, YOU'VE GOT A LOT MORE CONFIDENCE IN CORPORATE AMERICA THAN I DO' On Friday, the Sanders campaign accused Biden of ""dishonest attacks"" and furthering the health care industry's narrative on the issue. “It's disappointing Joe Biden is echoing the deceptions and falsehoods of the health care industry ... Joe Biden may love the insurance industry and the outrageously high premiums, co-payments and out-of-pocket expenses they charge us. Most Americans don’t,"" a campaign statement read. During a campaign stop in Nevada Friday, Sanders repeated his refrain that health care is a human right and that Medicare-for-all would cover every man, woman and child in the country. It requires no premiums, no deductibles and no out-of-pocket costs and would expand Medicare to include such things as dental care, hearing aids and home health care."" “Apparently the vice president thinks it is just wonderful for people to be paying $1,000 a month ... just for health care premiums,"" he said during the town hall event in Carson City. ""Having deductibles of $4,000 or $5,000 or more — not a problem. Paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs — not a problem. Well, I think those are problems."" ""It's not a terribly radical idea because in one form or another it exists in countries all over the world, including Canada,"" Sanders said. ""Is it free? No. It is funded out of the general fund in a progressive manner."" Later in the event, Sanders listened as a 58-year-old Navy veteran with Huntington's disease told the senator he was planning to kill himself after losing his health care and racking up $139,000 in medical expenses. SANDERS LAUGHS OUT LOUD AT BIDEN'S 'RATHER HUMOROUS' CLAIM HE'S TOO TRUSTING OF 'CORPORATE AMERICA' Sanders responded, ""No, you're not,"" and promised to meet with the man privately after the event, according to the  Las Vegas Journal-Review. The scrap between Biden and Sanders is a microcosm of a broader, ongoing debate within the  Democratic Party . Sanders, a self-described  Democratic socialist , has championed progressive proposals and adopted a more aggressive, anti-corporate tone than Biden has. When the two faced off on Thursday, Biden attempted to mock Sanders' anti-corporate image by accusing him of trusting employers too much in his ""Medicare for all"" proposal. Biden argued that employers who now pay a share of workers’ premiums would pocket that money instead of giving workers raises if the government were to cover all health care costs. “Let me tell you something, for a socialist, you’ve got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do,"" Biden said. Sanders later laughed that statement off during an interview with Fox News following the debate. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""One of us voted for the Wall Street bailout -- that was Biden, by the way. One of us voted for disastrous trade agreements that were sponsored by corporate America -- that was Biden. One of us voted for a bankruptcy bill that was pushed by the banks -- that was Biden,"" he said. ""So, to suggest that Bernie Sanders is sympathetic to the corporate elite, I think, is rather humorous."" Fox News' Madeleine Rivera, Brooke Singman, Charles Creitz, and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"In Houston on Friday, a day after the  third presidential debate , the Democratic frontrunner was asked by a reporter if he will be disclosing his medical records to address worries about his age. ""Yes,"" Biden said, then with a quip, ""What health concerns man? You want to wrestle?"" Asked about the timing, Biden said he'll release his medical records ""when I get the next physical"" exam and ""before there's the first vote."" A Biden spokesman confirmed to CNN that meant before the Iowa caucuses in February 2020. Biden had previously committed to releasing his medical records before the general election.  ""I mean there's no reason for me not to release my medical records,"" Biden told reporters Friday. Although the statesman would be the oldest US president to be sworn in for his first term,  Biden is not the oldest candidate in the race  for the Democratic ticket -- nor is he the only one in his 70s.  At 78, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is older than Biden. While Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is 70. Together with Biden, the three septuagenarians have been  dominating the field  of their younger Democratic rivals. Warren also plans to release her medical records before the Iowa caucuses, Kristen Orthman, a spokeswoman for the Warren campaign, confirmed to CNN. And a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign confirmed that the Vermont senator will release his medical records before the first votes are cast. NBC  first reported  Sanders' pledge.  Biden's propensity for gaffes and slip-ups, which is consistent with his previous campaigns, have been linked to his age by Democratic challengers and other critics. Biden has said that it's  ""totally appropriate""  for people to consider his age when evaluating him as candidate, though he has repeatedly assured that he's in good health and fine shape for the job.  If he were to win the White House, Biden would be 78 years old when he's sworn into office in 2021 -- which would make him the oldest president at the beginning of his first term in American history. Trump was the oldest president at the beginning of his first term in 2017. During the  third presidential debate  on Thursday, Julián Castro, 44, made what was seen  as an attack  against Biden's age by questioning Biden's memory.  Castro later denied  it was such an attack. After the debate, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said Castro had ""really legitimate concerns about can he be someone in a long grueling campaign"" and said that Castro ""has every right to call it out."" ""There's a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden's ability to carry the ball across the end line without fumbling,"" Booker told CNN's Anderson Cooper late Thursday night. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, another Democrat running for president but who was not on the debate stage Thursday,  recently said  Biden ""is declining"" and thought he didn't have the stamina, Bloomberg reported."
"HBO host Bill Maher tells 'Real Time' audience that he hopes Koch's end was painful; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' ""Real Time"" host  Bill Maher  mocked  MSNBC 's ""Never Trump"" hosts and analysts for going ""very far left"" during the Trump era. During the ""Overtime"" segment of Friday night's show, Maher asked former RNC chairman and MSNBC political analyst Michael Steele about the ""roster"" of former Republican politicians and operatives that appear on the network, invoking former Bush official-turned-MSNBC host  Nicolle Wallace  and former GOP strategist Steve Schmidt. ""We only see Never Trumpers,"" Maher began. ""We see people like you on TV. And Nicolle Wallace. And Steve Schmidt. You're a Never Trumper, right?"" BILL MAHER SAYS FAR-LEFT POLICIES OF 2020 DEMS ARE A 'CANCER ON PROGRESSIVISM' ""No, I don't classify myself,"" Steele responded. ""So you could vote for Trump?"" Maher asked. ""No,"" Steele quickly answered. ""Well, that's a Never Trumper!"" Maher exclaimed, sparking laughter from the rest of the panel and the audience. Steele attempted to explain himself, saying he refuses to play the ""political game"" of labeling himself, which he suggested helps opponents. Maher then pivoted to Never Trumpers and how they would vote in the 2020 election. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""What do the Never Trumpers do? What do they say on MSNBC, who have gone very far left because look who's giving them their paycheck,"" Maher continued. ""What do they say if it's Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren at the top of the ticket? They 'never Trump' but would Nicolle Wallace vote for them?"" ""There are a lot of folks like Nicolle and Joe [Scarborough] and others who have said, 'Look, I'll vote for the dog in the car' if that's who the Democrats nominate,"" Steele said. ""I'm just amused because I see them on MSNBC and I remember how they used to talk when it was Bush and Romney and they didn't even want ObamaCare!"" Maher exclaimed."
"WASHINGTON — He’s in our heads. Even more than we knew. It isn’t just that he hovered over the Democratic debate on Thursday night: Should the candidates attack him or leave him to self-destruct? Were they talking about him too much or not enough? It’s more profound than that. Donald Trump has fundamentally altered the way we experience politics. We’ve been trying to figure out for three years if he is a mad aberration, doomed to fade, or if he is rewiring the game in some permanent way. Watching that depressing debate, one must conclude that the rewiring is well underway. Trump is one of the phoniest people ever to walk the earth. Maybe that’s why he was uniquely suited to tear through the phony conventions and bloated world of consultants that made up politics as usual. There were a lot of good politicians on the debate stage in Houston. But the night rang hollow as they clung to the old conventions — the overcoached performances, the canned lines, the pandering, the well-worn childhood anecdotes meant to project “relatability.” Tactics superseded passion and vision. Everyone seemed one tick off. Unlike with Barack Obama in 2008, none made you feel like you wanted to pump your fist in the air and march into the future behind them. “Being a good politician doesn’t matter anymore,” lamented one freaked-out congressional Democrat afterward. “It’s like being a great used car salesman. We need a Holden Caulfield to call out all the phonies.” It’s a paradox wrapped in an oxymoron about a moron: Trump’s faux-thenticity somehow makes the Democratic candidates seem more packaged, more stuck in politician-speak. In speeches and at rallies, Trump kicks over the traces, saying what’s on his mind, even though it often doesn’t mesh with reality, even though it lacks dignity and can be ugly and hateful. Just consider his  speech at the House Republican retreat  in Baltimore, happening at the same time as the debate. Basking in chants of “Four more years!” Trump unleashed several buzzwords and crowd-pleasers, trashing eco-friendly paper straws and energy-efficient light bulbs. “The bulb that we’re being forced to use — No. 1, to me, most importantly, the light is no good,” he said. “I always look orange. And so do you. The light is the worst. But No. 2, it’s many times more expensive than that old incandescent bulb that worked very well. And very importantly — I don’t know if you know this — they have warnings. If it breaks, it’s considered a hazardous waste site. It’s gases inside.” “And,” the Narcissus president repeated a couple of times for good measure, “the light is not as good. I mean, frankly, the light is not as good.” He offered his usual aria of insults to the assembled shameless Republicans, calling Elizabeth Warren “Pocahontas” and Joe Biden “Sleepy Joe.” “And now it looks like she could beat Sleepy Joe,” Trump said. “He’s fallen asleep. He has no idea what the hell he’s doing or saying.” He made a Pete Buttigieg short joke and referred to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as “Cortez” because her name, he said, is too long. He called the squad “A.O.C. plus three” and warned of the “grim specter of socialism.” He mocked the Green New Deal, saying: “That’s a beauty. No more cows. No more planes. I guess no more people, right?” Then he teased Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader: “Because Kevin is just like a cow. He’s just smaller.” The split screen Thursday night was riveting. You know that the barbarian behind the White House gates will run with all the ammunition the Democrats were supplying him in real time. The president said, “Democrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans,” and Beto O’Rourke said, “Hell, yes, we are going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.” The president said the Democrats would impose “crippling taxes,” and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren proposed all their free stuff that would require tax hikes. This exact display from Trump is just what many Americans find exhausting. It’s draining to live on the edge all the time, to be plunged into the culture wars — and now the straw and light-bulb wars — with the tweets and the tantrums and the put-downs, to feel that we’re being borne back ceaselessly into the past. But how to counter this? “No one made the broadest, most appealing message for change,” David Axelrod said of the debate. “Can we, as a country, function any more if we have another four years of waking up to turmoil?” There were a bunch of high-end, professional pols there and yet no one actually won it. Not a good sign. The candidates struggled to alchemize our exhaustion into excitement. The three hours seemed endless, with two questions hanging over the night: “Can’t anybody here play this game?” and “Will the most beatable candidate in American history win twice?” The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters  to the editor.
