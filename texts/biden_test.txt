Joseph R. Biden Jr.’ s presidential campaign has sharply scaled back his online advertising, cutting spending so severely since August that he is now investing only a fraction of what his top rivals are on Facebook and Google, the two dominant internet platforms. In a race where many voters are following politics on their smartphones, Mr. Biden’s pullback is an unusual and potentially worrisome sign about his appeal among the Democratic activists, young people and  donors  w ho are especially engaged on social media . Candidates rarely withdraw so much money from their online campaigns unless they are seeing weak results in online fund-raising, according to interviews with digital strategists. Mr. Biden and other candidates will start announcing fund-raising results as early as Tuesday morning for the third quarter of 2019; he came in second for the last quarter, behind Pete Buttigieg, pulling in online money early but mostly relying on big donors. More recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other top rivals have outspent Mr. Biden online: He was only the sixth-biggest Democratic spender on Facebook ads in the seven days ending Saturday, even as he began spending more money on digital ads targeting President Trump, Ukraine and impeachment. Instead, he has shifted his spending priorities toward traditional tactics like buying television ads in Iowa. But that strategy has not paid dividends so far: Ms. Warren, a leading rival for the 2020 nomination, recently surpassed him in  a key Iowa poll . Mr. Biden’s campaign strategy has been driven, from the start, by the political  assumption  that the Democratic electorate is more moderate than the progressives who are  often loudest online , and he has built his candidacy around appealing to older and more centrist voters.  But strategists say Mr. Biden’s online pullback is risky if he hopes to engage and build support among a broader cross-section of Democrats that is almost certainly necessary to win the nomination.  “It’s clear that there’s something in the numbers that’s directing them to go in that direction, and the likeliest explanation is that the rate of return just wasn’t there for Facebook and Google,” said Tim Lim, a veteran Democratic digital strategist unaligned in 2020. “Which is very, very unusual.” Zac Moffatt, a Republican strategist who led digital operations for Mitt Romney’s presidential run, said abandoning a medium used heavily by so many “reeks of desperation.” “You are spending at least a third to half your life on your mobile phone, and they’re deciding they don’t need to have a message for you there,” Mr. Moffatt said. Online spending serves two purposes: Promoting the candidates’ messages and raising money. The Biden campaign said it was committed to an ongoing digital plan, with a seven-figure digital ad buy planned in the fourth quarter of 2019.   But if Mr. Biden struggles to collect small donations online, he will have to depend more on traditional donors and bundlers while his two leading rivals, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, emphasize their grass-roots support. The decline of Mr. Biden’s online spending has been precipitous. He entered the race  in April  as one of the contest’s biggest digital advertisers, spending $1.2 million on Facebook and Google in his first two weeks. Now he is toward the back of the pack. During a 30-day stretch leading up to the September debate, Mr. Biden, who has regularly led the field in national polls, ranked 16th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising on Facebook, spending only $32,000 — placing the former vice president behind two candidates who dropped out during that period and five who did not make the debate stage. And on Google, his spending plunged to $300 during one week in August — less than one-thousandth of what he spent in his first week as a candidate, when campaigns often spend the most. Ms. Warren spent $66,000 that same week. The Biden campaign cast its diminishing digital footprint as part of a broader strategy. “Our campaign invested a robust digital spend early on to build out supporter lists, outspending all other campaigns from our launch through most of the summer,” said T.J. Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden. “By strategically front-loading our investment, we were able to rapidly expand our reach early, instead of meting out our spend over a longer period of time.” Mr. Biden’s digital spending has ticked up in recent days, as he bought a slate of Facebook ads related to Mr. Trump’s efforts to have Ukraine investigate the Biden family (“Stand with Joe,” some ads say). The exploding story line about foreign interference and impeachment has been good for Mr. Biden’s bottom line:  A campaign official said the past week was Mr. Biden’s best for fund-raising since the second week of his campaign . While Mr. Biden’s Facebook ads, like his stump speech, have focused heavily on Mr. Trump, records show he has also tested messages on health care, Medicare, the Supreme Court and guns. The Biden campaign noted that it was still investing in other online platforms that make less advertising data available to the public, such as Spotify, Amazon and Hulu.  Mr. Biden began his campaign with a show of strength, raising $6.3 million in the first 24 hours from nearly 100,000  people . He began with a key advantage: Formerly President Barack Obama’s running mate, he had access to the old email list from the Obama campaigns.  Daily fund-raising data  through June shows that Mr. Biden’s first days were his strongest for attracting online donations. But in the last six weeks for which data is available, Mr. Biden spent a meager $20,900 on Google, a platform that includes both the internet’s dominant search engine and YouTube. In that same six-week span, Ms. Warren spent more than 25 times as much: $553,700. “It is not a good sign for his campaign,” said Marne Pike, the chief executive of a Democratic digital strategy firm not affiliated with any 2020 candidate. “I would have a very hard  time imagining no  one was searching for Joe Biden and clicking on the ads.” It was a similar story on Facebook. There, Mr. Buttigieg has been the top spender, outpacing Mr. Biden in the last 30 days by a ratio of about 12 to 1. Mr. Biden is being outspent by candidates who, like him, are household names with big campaign budgets (like Mr. Sanders, by more than 7 to 1 in the last 30 days), and also by lesser-known figures (the former housing secretary Julián Castro, who has struggled to raise money, by more than 2 to 1). As Mr. Biden has withdrawn from Facebook and Google, he has bought up more than $700,000 in television ads in recent weeks in Iowa. Despite those ads, Ms. Warren recently edged ahead of him in the closely monitored  Des Moines Register poll  of likely Iowa caucusgoers. Mr. Ducklo, the Biden spokesman, said small contributions “have been essential to getting our campaign message in front of voters: funding our television ads in Iowa and rapidly expanding the field operations in the early states that is  knocking doors  and making calls.” Andrew Bleeker, president of the Democratic digital firm Bully Pulpit Interactive, said that Mr. Biden’s more moderate position in the Democratic primary could make it harder to raise money online. “From a brand perspective, he can’t be that incendiary and that’s what’s rewarded online,” he said. Keegan Goudiss, who served as Mr. Sanders’s director of digital advertising in 2016 but is unaligned in 2020, agreed: “Joe Biden hasn’t thrown the kind of red meat he needs to throw to do well online.” Mr. Biden has also wrapped his candidacy in an aura of inevitability, which does not allow him to sound the alarm to supporters, a tactic that can juice online giving. (Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, for instance, recently scored his biggest day for online donations when he said he would quit the 2020 race if he failed to raise $1.7 million by the end of this month.) One startling measure of Mr. Biden’s diminished online fund-raising ambition is the goal his campaign announced for the last days of September: raising $500,000. By contrast, M r. Buttigieg set out to raise $1.5 million  online, Senator Kamala Harris of California $1 million, former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas $750,000 and the businessman Andrew Yang $1.5 million. At this juncture in the election cycle — with the first primary votes still more than four months away — most campaigns with spare money are still spending heavily online for what they call “acquisition”: convincing people to give their email addresses through petition drives, online surveys and the like. Those people are then wooed to become donors. But for Mr. Biden, an analysis of both the content and geographic distribution of his ads suggests he had mostly abandoned trying to acquire new online donors in the last month — at least until the recent Ukraine controversy. The Biden campaign said it had put $40,000 into ads  over two days last week , more than it spent on Facebook during that recent 30-day stretch. The ads that Mr. Biden has been running target an older electorate than that of his top rivals, according to demographic data collected by Bully Pulpit. An overwhelming share of his spending on Facebook — 84 percent — has targeted voters who are 45 or older. Compare that to Mr. Sanders, who recently touted that the most common age among his donors is 29. Only one-third of his Facebook ad budget  has targeted  those above 45.
In a tweet on Wednesday, President Trump addressed his social media followers with four words, all caps: “LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH!” Under that was a video showing  Chad Kroeger , the lead singer of the Canadian postgrunge rock band Nickelback, holding a framed picture of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his son Hunter Biden  and  an American businessman. The video, which Twitter had removed by Thursday morning, is from the music video for “Photograph,” a 2005 Nickelback single.  In the song’s original  video , Mr. Kroeger holds up an old picture of himself and a friend as he sings: “Look at this photograph/Every time I do it makes me laugh/How did our eyes get so red?/And what the hell is on Joey’s head?” Image The Nickelback meme shared by President Trump.  Mr. Trump used an altered version of that footage, and he was far from the first to do so.  The Nickelback meme is more than a decade old , and you can find multiple versions online:  video clips  or  still photos  of Mr. Kroeger holding up his photograph, with a funny or absurd picture edited into his frame. (Part of the joke is that a lot of people don’t like Nickelback. The band is known for inspiring some  pretty   vigorous   contempt , in spite of — and also because of — its history of filling stadiums and generating a steady stream of megahit singles that were inescapable on radio stations during the 2000s.) In the video shared by Mr. Trump, the inserted photograph showed Joe Biden and Hunter Biden holding golf clubs. And as Fox News had  reported  on Tuesday, the man at far left was  Devon Archer , who served with Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. In Mr. Trump’s video, that photograph was juxtaposed with a clip of Mr. Biden saying, “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.” But by Thursday morning, the video in  Mr. Trump’s tweet  was not there. In its place was a message saying that the video had been removed in response to a report  from  the copyright owner. The president’s tweet was in line with his recent attempts to deflect attention from the controversies surrounding  revelations  that he pressed Ukraine’s leader to investigate Mr. Biden, a leading candidate in the Democratic presidential primary. Mr. Trump has accused Mr. Biden of trying to help Burisma by pushing for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor. As The New York Times  reported this spring , no evidence has surfaced that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor’s dismissal.  An  impeachment inquiry  against the president was announced on Sept. 24. Since then, Mr. Trump has promoted  conspiratorial messages  that suggest an impeachment would  amount to a coup  or could cause a “ Civil War like fracture .” Some critics of Mr. Trump have  called on Twitter  to take stronger action to rein in language that could be seen as bullying, dog-whistling or inciting violence — even if it comes from a sitting president. But the removal of the president’s “Photograph” clip was about copyrights, not content. It is unclear whether Nickelback members were involved; representatives of the band and of Mr. Kroeger did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday. But  an entry in Lumen , an independent database at the  Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society  at Harvard, shows that the record label company Warner Music Group alerted Twitter to the copyright infringement on Wednesday. As a result of that notice, Twitter confirmed, the video Mr. Trump had shared was taken down. Warner Music Group declined to comment.  This  has happened before. In February, Mr. Trump shared a video on Twitter that included a song by the rock band R.E.M. The group  tweeted  its  disapproval , and the video in Mr. Trump’s tweet  was removed . In April, another tweet from the president featured music from the movie “The Dark Knight Rises”; that, too, was  reportedly  removed because it had been unauthorized. Jennifer Grygiel , a social media expert and assistant professor of communications at Syracuse University, said the president’s use of memes to reach his supporters directly was worthy of examination.  “The president is a pro memer, and the way he uses social media needs to be taken seriously,” they said. “A Nickelback meme is bizarre, to say the least, but it’s effective when it comes to its propaganda properties.” Doyle Canning, a Democratic  congressional  candidate in Oregon who wrote  a book on memes and political movements , said that tweets like these drew attention away from more important issues. “Trump is using Twitter, and then this controversy, to amplify this story rather than the story about his impending impeachment,” she said. “And so the pile-on and the echo effect that you see around Trump’s tweets distract, I think, from a real constitutional crisis in the country.”
On Sept. 24, 2015, Geoffrey Pyatt, then the American ambassador to Ukraine,  spoke in Odessa  about the scourge of corruption. It was about a year and a half after what is sometimes called the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukrainians overthrew the kleptocratic, Russian-aligned regime of Viktor Yanukovych. The country was trying to move in a more liberal, European direction. Corruption, said Pyatt, threatened to hold the new Ukraine back. Pyatt called out the office of Viktor Shokin, then the prosecutor general of Ukraine. “Corrupt actors within the prosecutor general’s office are making things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform,” he said. Pyatt specifically lambasted Shokin’s office for subverting a British case against a man named Mykola Zlochevsky, Yanukovych’s former ecology minister. In 2014, as part of a money-laundering investigation, British authorities froze $23 million Zlochevsky had in London. They requested supporting documentation from Shokin’s office. Instead, it intervened on Zlochevsky’s behalf. “As a result the money was freed by the U.K. court and shortly thereafter the money was moved to Cyprus,” said Pyatt. “Shokin was seen as a single point of failure clogging up the system and blocking corruption cases,” a former official in Barack Obama’s administration told me. Vice President  Joe Biden  eventually took the lead in calling for Shokin’s ouster. As all this was happening,  Biden’s son, Hunter , sat on the board of Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company that Zlochevsky co-founded, at some points earning $50,000 a month. Zlochevsky might have thought he could ingratiate himself with the Obama administration by buying an association with the vice president. All available evidence suggests he was wrong. Turning this history on its head, Trump has accused  Joe Biden  of coercing Ukraine to jettison Shokin in order to protect Hunter. He has pressured Ukraine’s current president to open an investigation into the Bidens, which would make Trump’s charges seem more credible. As the president faces impeachment, his surrogates are parroting his attack on Biden, and his campaign is reportedly spending a staggering  $10 million on an ad  to amplify the smear. Journalists, perhaps seeking to appear balanced, have sometimes described Trump’s claims about Biden as “ unsubstantiated ” or “ unsupported .” That is misleading, because it suggests more muddiness in the factual record than actually exists. Trump isn’t making unproven charges against Biden. He is blatantly lying about him. He and his defenders are spreading a conspiracy theory that is the precise opposite of the truth. [ Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ] Like most effective conspiracy theories, this one is built around a speck of something real. Hunter Biden’s place on Burisma’s board was untoward, even if it’s preposterous for Trump to complain about nepotistic corruption. Biden’s son doesn’t seem to have broken any laws, but the way he  traded on his name was still sleazy . Joe Biden appears to have been uncomfortable with his son’s involvement with Burisma;  in a New Yorker profile , Hunter recalled his father saying, “I hope you know what you are doing.” Hunter said they never spoke further about the issue; Biden has made a point of not talking to his son about his business dealings. It’s not hard to imagine why Biden didn’t press Hunter. The Biden boys and their father had been through hell together. Hunter has said his first memory was waking up in the hospital next to his older brother, Beau, after the car crash that killed their mother and baby sister. He grew up to be a troubled man, his life pockmarked by addiction and failure. Beau died of brain cancer a few months before Biden  traveled to Ukraine  to push the government to crack down on corruption. It’s not shocking that, at a moment when his family was consumed by grief, Biden wasn’t inclined to confront his surviving son. But even if you’re not inclined to empathize with Biden — even if you assume the worst about him — Trump’s conspiracy theory makes no sense. To believe it, you’d have to first believe that the foreign affairs apparatus of the Obama administration was willing to put its credibility on the line in service of the black sheep of the Biden family. After all, Joe Biden wasn’t freelancing in Ukraine; he was carrying out White House policy. Further, if the Trump administration truly believes that Obama’s Ukraine policy was crooked, one might ask why it has Pyatt, who helped accomplish that policy, representing America as ambassador to Greece. Most important, getting rid of Shokin made an investigation of Burisma  more likely, not less . “He didn’t want to investigate Burisma,” the Ukrainian anti-corruption activist Daria Kaleniuk  told The Washington Post . “Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.” However bad the optics around Hunter Biden, Joe Biden was not serving his son’s interests. If anything, they were working at cross-purposes. As I’ve written multiple times, I don’t want Biden to be the Democratic nominee. There’s much in his  legislative record that troubles me , and I don’t think he’s as  electable as his champions claim . In some ways, my preferred political outcome would be advanced if Trump’s Ukraine scandal ends up tarring Biden as well. But Trump’s weaponized disinformation is corrosive to democracy no matter whom it targets. Like many authoritarians, he depends on getting people to accept a big lie or to give up on the idea of truth altogether. If he succeeds in defaming Biden today, he’ll be even more audacious in using the same strategy against anyone else who threatens him. What’s at stake isn’t just Biden’s political future. It’s how much Trump can erode the political salience of reality, and how much the media helps him. The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters  to the editor.

RENO, Nev. — Former Vice President  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  on Wednesday night delivered his most forceful response yet to  President Trump’s  attacks on him and his son, accusing the Trump team of waging a campaign of “lies, smears, distortions and name calling” geared at knocking him out of  the presidential race . Mr. Biden  made his comments during a campaign swing through Nevada after days of internal debate among his advisers over how best to refute  unsubstantiated claims  by the president and his personal lawyer that  Mr. Biden  improperly assisted his son’s business ventures in Ukraine and China. The counterattack, people close to Mr. Biden said, was intended to demonstrate what he had been promising supporters for the past week: that he would not let Mr. Trump “hijack” his campaign by allowing the president’s narrative to take root. It was also intended to prove, in a walk-and-chew-gum kind of way, that he could multitask even when facing withering political fire — unveiling  a serious policy proposal on guns  early Wednesday in Las Vegas, then pivoting to a sharp political attack by nightfall in the north. In the speech, the former vice president said the attacks on his family were intended to divert attention from the  widening impeachment inquiry  into Mr. Trump’s  attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens  — and he cited them as proof that the White House feared him more than any other Democratic presidential contender. “Let me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me: I’m not going anywhere,” Mr. Biden told a crowd of about 500 at the Truckee Meadows Community College here. “You’re not going to destroy me,” he said to cheers from supporters, a handful wearing “Impeach 45” jerseys. “And you’re not going to destroy my family. I don’t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.” The American people, Mr. Biden said, “know me and they know him. The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone’s credibility is a joke.” Earlier in the day, speaking at a gun safety forum in Las Vegas, Mr. Biden blasted the president and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had communicated with Ukrainian officials on Mr. Trump’s behalf. He said there was “zero, zero, zero” evidence that his family had done anything wrong. Mr. Biden’s increasingly bitter fight with Mr. Trump comes at a potential tipping point in the 2020 Democratic presidential race. Until recently, Mr. Biden had been leading in most national polls since he entered the field last spring. But Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, fueled by a highly disciplined campaign, has surged in many early-voting states. A Monmouth University national poll released Wednesday  showed Mr. Biden locked in a statistical dead heat with Ms. Warren, who garnered 28 percent support from Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters to his 25 percent, a difference within the survey’s margin of error. At Wednesday night’s rally, Mr. Biden took a swipe at some of his Democratic opponents who had accused him of focusing too much on Mr. Trump and not enough on issues facing voters.  “A lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump,” he said. “I agree. We have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum.”  Mr. Biden’s team has been alarmed by reports that Mr. Trump’s supporters plan to launch an aggressive advertising campaign to portray the former vice president as the person who had acted improperly — despite the lack of any evidence to support that claim. And Mr. Biden’s top advisers have been equally incensed by what they view as the news media’s willingness to air unsupported allegations by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani. The president and his lawyer have alleged that Mr. Biden, as vice president, pressured the Ukrainians to force out a top prosecutor in order to derail an inquiry into a Ukrainian company that had paid his son, Hunter Biden. But Mr. Biden said Wednesday that he had been enforcing the demands of the Obama administration and other Western nations by seeking to replace the prosecutor with an official more committed to fighting corruption. On Sunday, Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield, two senior Biden strategists, wrote to several major television networks asking them to stop booking Mr. Giuliani on their news programs, accusing him of spreading “debunked conspiracy theories.” Mr. Biden amplified that argument on Wednesday, urging reporters to regard Mr. Trump’s statements, and his tweets, as not simply fodder for controversy but as a dangerous “abuse of power” that included enlisting foreign leaders as allies in his re-election effort. Mr. Trump, he said, is “afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November.” The president, in his own remarks on Wednesday, did not agree. “I’d rather run against Biden than almost any of those candidates,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House.
Former Vice President  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  has raised $15.2 million in the past three months, his campaign said Thursday, a drop-off of $7 million from the previous quarter and a sum that falls short of two leading Democratic rivals.  Mr. Biden, who began the Democratic presidential primary leading in the polls, has seen his advantage slip, falling behind Senator  Elizabeth Warren  of Massachusetts in several recent polls both nationally and in some early-voting primary states, including Iowa and New Hampshire. His total for the third quarter of the year was  another sign of unsteadiness . Several of his opponents released their third-quarter totals earlier this week. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has a strong small-dollar fund-raising base,  pulled in $25.3 million , his campaign said Tuesday, while Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.,  reported $19.1 million  raised during the last three months. Senator Kamala Harris of California raised  $11.6 million .  Ms. Warren has not yet announced her third-quarter total. The deadline for presidential candidates to file their reports is Oct. 15. Last quarter, Mr. Biden  pulled in   $22 million , one of the biggest hauls in the field for that time period, though he still fell behind  Mr. Buttigieg  for that quarter. Mr. Biden announced his total at a fund-raiser Thursday afternoon in Palo Alto, Calif., and the campaign announced it in a news release shortly afterward. His campaign declined to comment when asked about Mr. Biden’s cash on hand. At the fund-raiser, Mr. Biden appeared to take a veiled shot at the views of some of his more liberal opponents as he cautioned against a “socialist” response to President Trump, according to a news media pool report from the event. Mr. Sanders is a democratic socialist. “You’ve got to share in the benefits,” Mr. Biden said at the fund-raiser, where tickets were offered for $1,500 and $2,800. “That’s been broken. You don’t need some radical, radical socialist kind of answer to any of this — you’ve just got to make capitalism work like it’s supposed to work. We’ve got to save capitalism from this guy.” Ms. Warren identifies as a capitalist, though she has called for more far-reaching progressive policies — Medicare for all, for example — than Mr. Biden supports. Even before the $15 million figure was released, the Biden campaign and allies were playing down the significance of the quarterly total. One close Biden supporter pointed out the lack of traction that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have had among the broader electorate, as reflected in polling, and said that if money were all that mattered then Democrats would be nominating the billionaire financier Tom Steyer. Also Thursday, Mr. Biden was asked for his thoughts on selecting a running mate. “Look, if I could just manufacture someone out of the blue, I would very much think it’s important to have a woman, and even a woman of color, or someone of color as vice president,” he said. “But I’ve learned something different. Not different. Something else. The single most important thing you have to have as a president is someone you know is ideologically compatible with you, that you in fact share the same fundamental concerns and values.” The Thursday fund-raiser, and the end of the fund-raising quarter, arrived at an uncertain time for Mr. Biden: The House of Representatives is  pursuing an impeachment inquiry  against Mr. Trump amid revelations that he asked the president of Ukraine to “look into” Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden. There is no evidence that as vice president, Mr. Biden intentionally acted to aid his son’s business dealings there, and the news of Mr. Trump’s actions has outraged Democrats and signaled, to some, that the president is concerned about Mr. Biden’s candidacy. While Mr. Biden is fiercely protective of his family, the moment has thrust the delicate subject into the national spotlight — even as the question of how voters will respond remains fluid, and some of Mr. Biden’s advisers and allies privately acknowledge the risks associated with Mr. Trump’s focus on the Bidens. That dynamic did not stop his team from  fund-raising off the developments  involving Mr. Trump. The day after  details of  the president’s conversation came to light, the campaign tripled its daily online fund-raising average, Mr. Biden’s team said, though an adviser did not respond when asked last week whether that pace had continued. During the final days of the fund-raising quarter, Mr. Biden spent much of his time at high-dollar fund-raisers, often attending two or even three in one day as he visited wealthy enclaves like Bel Air, Calif., and Park City, Utah. Mr. Biden has been more reliant on high-dollar donors than some of his rivals in the Democratic primary:  Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders  have sworn off  big-money fund-raisers. At a fund-raiser in Los Angeles last Thursday, Mr. Biden told attendees that his campaign was close to landing nearly 670,000 donations from about 350,000 people, with an average donation of $46, according to a media pool report of the event. At the time, it wasn’t clear if those remarks were referring to the third-quarter haul or to a cumulative total. The campaign said Thursday that 98 percent of all donations came from grass-roots donors of $200 or less, and said that 56 percent of donors this quarter were new to the campaign.

IVANO-FRANKIVSK, Ukraine — His voice crackling over what he complained was a “terrible” sound system, Donald J. Trump in September 2015 heaped praise on the oligarch who had invited him to speak by video link from New York to a conference in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine. The Ukrainian oligarch, Victor Pinchuk, had secured 20 minutes of Mr. Trump’s time — and  a heap of flattery from the future president , who described him as “a very, very special man” — with  a donation of $150,000 to Mr. Trump’s now defunct foundation . Mr. Pinchuk, a steel magnate long enmeshed with Ukraine’s business and political elite, had earlier donated more than $10 million to the Clinton Foundation and been invited to dine at the Washington home of Hillary and Bill Clinton. The equal opportunity largess of powerful Ukrainians like Mr. Pinchuk helps explain why so many of the most dimly lit and hazardous roads of American politics keep leading back to Ukraine, a poor, dysfunctional country on Europe’s eastern fringe. [Read more about how  Ukraine landed in the middle of an American political drama .] Caught between the clashing geopolitical ambitions of Russia and the West, Ukraine has for years had to balance competing outside interests and worked hard to cultivate all sides, and also rival groups on the same side — no matter how incompatible their agendas — with offers of money, favors and prospects for career advancement. Paul Manafort, Rudolph Giuliani, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son Hunter and Hillary Clinton have all, at one time or another, found their way there, escorted by Ukrainian guides with deep pockets and a keen sense of how to appeal to their vanities, ambitions and greed. “The fact is Ukraine is an amazing place,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Pinchuk’s conference in 2015. “I’ve known so many people over so many years in the Ukraine.” He told Ukraine’s new president, Volodomyr Zelensky, much the same thing this week  when they met in New York , though the only specific person from Ukraine he wanted to tell Mr. Zelensky about was a former Miss Universe contestant. Ukraine, said Serhii Plokhy, a Harvard historian whose books include “ The Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine ,” has for centuries been tugged in different directions by rival suitors, and became a “battlefield” between Russia and the West when it declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. “The front lines are always places that attract both heroes and villains who go there from world capitals to make a name, advance a career, make a fortune, etc. — and then carry back home legacies, memories and skeletons for their closets,” Mr. Plokhy said. Ukraine’s allure for American carpetbaggers, political consultants and adventurers has put it at the center of not just one but now two presidential elections in the United States and a host of second-tier scandals. Before becoming Mr. Trump’s campaign manager before the 2016 election, Mr. Manafort made millions of dollars in Ukraine, working as an adviser to the country’s leadership out of an office in Kiev. Mr. Giuliani — who has also wound up working with opposing sides in internal Ukrainian battles — has repeatedly looked to the same city and a new set of Ukrainian leaders for dirt on Mr. Trump’s political foes ahead of the 2020 election. Yevhen Hlibovytskyi, a lecturer in philosophy at the Ukrainian Catholic University, said Ukraine’s pivotal position in geopolitical struggles had made Kiev, a picturesque capital of cobblestoned streets on the Dnepr River, into the 21st century’s equivalent of Cold War dens of intrigue like Vienna and Berlin, or Casablanca during World War II. “Ukraine is the country that hosts the Berlin Wall at the moment,” he said. “Ukraine is the country where the clash between the free and unfree world takes place. It’s only natural that some players will be seeking protection in the West,” sometimes by crossing palms with silver. Put upon over the centuries by more powerful neighbors claiming their land, notably Russia, Poland and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Ukrainians have rarely had firm allies or even their own functioning state, a situation that has encouraged a highly transactional approach to foreign and also domestic affairs. Unlike Russia, ruled since the time of Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century by a single, strong leader, usually a tyrant, Ukraine has always been a land of competing power centers. This has made it a fertile ground for democracy but also left it a highly fractured nation with an ever shifting constellation of feuding power-brokers who often look to foreigners for help in their internal struggles. The  whistle-blower’s complaint released on Thursday  revealed how Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, played into this dynamic, focusing his efforts to get Mr. Biden and his son investigated on a group of senior law-enforcement officials in Ukraine who had been locked for months in a bitter turf war with rival factions within the same state structure. The officials Mr. Giuliani sought out in the name of fighting corruption were engaged in a long feud with Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau. The bureau, which has worked closely with the F.B.I. and was set up in 2014 with strong support from the Obama administration, is one of the few government agencies in Ukraine that Western diplomats in Kiev view as reasonably honest and competent. Mr. Giuliani has his own business history in the country as well. More than two years ago, his company, Giuliani Security and Safety, signed a contract with a wealthy Ukrainian, Pavel Fuks, to consult on emergency planning in Mr. Fuks’s hometown, Kharkiv. At the time, Mr. Fuks and others had become entangled in a complicated $1.5 billion deal to buy Ukrainian government bonds. In an investigation, Al Jazeera  reported  that the real sellers were sanctioned former insiders in the government of the disgraced former president of Ukraine, Viktor F. Yanukovych. Political survival in Ukraine has for centuries often hinged on finding a strong patron abroad. This sometimes led to disaster, most famously in the case of Ivan Mazepa, the Cossack leader of an embryonic state in eastern Ukraine in the 17th century. Initially an ally of Peter the Great of Russia, Mazepa, worried by the rise of powerful Cossack rivals, switched sides to ally with Russia’s great enemy at the time, Sweden, which he thought would offer protection. Instead, it led him to crushing defeat by Russia at the Battle of Poltava in 1709. “Ukrainians all the time tried to form an alliance with the stronger side,” said Volodymyr Yermolenko, editor in chief at Ukraine World, an online magazine. Mazepa, despite his defeat, is revered as a national hero in Ukraine for trying, albeit with catastrophic consequences, to hold Russia at bay by finding a powerful patron in the West. Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager and now a convicted fraudster,  made a fortune in Ukraine  by convincing its since toppled pro-Russian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, that he could, for a hefty fee, help woo Europe and blacken the reputation of his main political rival, Yulia Timochenko, who had been thrown in jail. Mr. Biden’s son Hunter earned at least $850,000 for serving on the board of a Cyprus-registered Ukrainian gas company that needed help in cleaning up its image after falling foul of anticorruption investigators in Ukraine. The company insisted it was the victim of internal score-settling. Yevhen Mahda, director of the Institute of World Policy, a research group, compared Ukraine’s recruitment of people like Mr. Manafort to the medieval practice of paying the Catholic Church for “indulgences,” which were supposed to reduce God’s punishment for sinful behavior. “A lot of Ukrainian politicians have this stereotype that you pay an influential figure in the West, from Europe or America, and they will cleanse you of your sins,” he said. The pursuit of foreign protectors and patrons has been a common feature of Ukraine’s political and business elite, no matter what their own political leanings. Ukraine’s former president Petro O. Poroshenko, elected after street protests toppled his pro-Russian predecessor in February 2014, made good relations with the Obama administration his top foreign relations priority and then invested heavily in wooing the Trump administration, despite having favored Mrs. Clinton in the 2016 election. Mr. Poroshenko’s eagerness to win over Mr. Trump and his growing fears that political rivals would thwart his re-election opened the way for Mr. Giuliani to press Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko, who has since been fired, to help Mr. Trump’s own re-election by investigating Mr. Biden and his son. How Mr. Poroshenko expected the Trump administration to help lift his sagging fortunes ahead of Ukraine’s presidential election, held in two rounds in March and April this year, is unclear. He got trounced anyway, losing emphatically to Mr. Zelensky, whose own officials quickly became the Trump team’s new targets in its drive to damage Mr. Biden. While Democrats want Mr. Trump impeached over his dealings with Ukraine, the president and his allies have counterattacked with their own Ukraine-focused scandals. They have revived a debunked theory that the country colluded with the Clinton campaign to hurt Mr. Trump’s chances in 2016 and asserted, with little evidence, that Mr. Biden used his position as vice president to prevent Ukraine from investigating his son. Ukrainians, jaded after years of watching their own leaders trade the power and privileges of office for personal financial or political gain, have mostly shrugged off what, for Mr. Trump, is possibly the most serious scandal to buffet the White House since Watergate toppled President Richard Nixon in 1974. That a country few Americans paid much attention to in the past now commands center stage in Washington has stirred mostly bemusement in Ukraine. Those feelings are also tinged with a touch of pride that, after centuries in the shadow of Russia, its giant neighbor to the east, the nation is no longer seen as a backwater but a pivot around which the fate of the world’s most powerful country implausibly turns. Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine’s foreign minister under Mr. Poroshenko, said in  a wry Twitter message this week  that going down in history “as the country that led to the impeachment of the U.S. president” was “not a very fun prospect.” But, he added, “Now everyone understands what we are capable of.”
The 2020 campaign ad wars have begun. CNN rejected a pair of provocative ads from President Trump’s re-election campaign on Thursday, saying the 30-second spots deriding the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry — one deeming the effort “nothing short of a coup” — contained inaccuracies and unfairly attacked the network’s journalists. It is unusual but not unprecedented for television networks to reject a political advertisement from a presidential candidate. On the eve of last year’s midterm elections, major channels, including Fox News,  removed a commercial  from Mr. Trump’s political team that portrayed immigrants as a violent threat. But political ads tend to be contentious in the latter stages of a campaign — not 13 months before Election Day. And CNN’s decision could foreshadow a longer conflict between Mr. Trump’s political aides and network executives who are tasked with reviewing the accuracy of the information that reaches viewers. The Trump ads were recently posted online as part of what the campaign said was a multimillion-dollar advertising buy on national cable stations and digital platforms. One, “Biden Corruption,” repeats unsubstantiated allegations about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s activities in Ukraine. “Joe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son’s company,” a narrator intones over grainy footage of Mr. Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate. After referring to Democrats in general, the narrator adds, “And their media lap dogs fall in line,” as clips are shown of the CNN anchors Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo and the network’s chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta. The MSNBC host Rachel Maddow appears as well. No evidence  has surfaced that Mr. Biden intentionally tried to help his son Hunter Biden by pushing for the dismissal of the Ukrainian prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin. Members of the Obama administration, as well as other international leaders, had sought Mr. Shokin’s removal amid accusations that he ignored corruption claims. Mr. Shokin was  voted out  by the Ukrainian Parliament in 2016. [Read about the issues behind the impeachment inquiry  here .] CNN said in a statement on Thursday that the commercial failed to meet its advertising standards. “In addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN,” a network spokesman said. Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for Mr. Trump’s campaign, responded that the ad was “entirely accurate and was reviewed by counsel.” “CNN spends all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming,” Mr. Murtaugh wrote in a statement. “So it’s not surprising that they’re shielding him from truthful advertising, too.” Later, CNN said it had also rejected another Trump ad, “ Coup ,” which presents the impeachment inquiry as an effort “to undo the election, regardless of facts,” and accuses House Democrats of “fabricating evidence.” “The ad contains assertions of fact about the whistle-blower complaint that have been refuted by the Intelligence inspector general,” CNN said. “In addition, it is inaccurate to use the word ‘coup’ to describe a constitutionally prescribed legal process.” [Read more about  “coup” claims  used by Mr. Trump’s supporters.] The moves by CNN are likely to inflame longstanding tensions between the news channel and the president, who denounced the network at multiple public appearances this week. At a White House news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Trump called CNN staff members “corrupt people.” CNN said it had agreed to carry a third commercial submitted by the Trump campaign, which focuses on the president’s accomplishments in office. Mr. Trump has said his request for help digging into the Bidens was legitimate and part of a “perfect” phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. On Thursday, Mr. Trump  publicly asked China  to investigate the former vice president. The impeachment inquiry has spurred a surge in campaign spending since it was announced on Sept. 24. Need to Impeach, a group founded and funded mainly by the billionaire Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer,  said this week  that it planned to spend $3.1 million on television and digital ads urging Republican senators to remove Mr. Trump. The Trump campaign has spent more than $1.6 million to advertise on Mr. Trump’s Facebook page in the past seven days, including as much as $21,000 on the “Biden Corruption” ad, according to the platform’s ad library. Facebook does not fact-check speech from politicians, generally allowing it on the platform “even when it would otherwise break our normal content rules,” Nick Clegg, a Facebook executive and former British deputy prime minister, said in Washington  last week . But Daniel Wessel, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said on Thursday that Facebook should monitor and remove all false ads, including “Biden Corruption.” “Facebook owes that to its readers,” Mr. Wessel said. “We all have a role to play in combating these lies, and that includes Facebook.” Mr. Biden’s team  weighed in , as well. In a formal letter on Thursday, his campaign manager, Greg Schultz, urged Fox News to reject the Trump campaign’s ad, saying it contained “false, definitively debunked conspiracy theories.” “We are putting you on notice about the absolute falsity of the advertisement’s claims,” Mr. Schultz wrote. Fox News responded in a statement: “We are not in the business of censoring ads from candidates on either side of the aisle. Vice President Joe Biden has a standing invitation to appear on any of our platforms.”
Fox News personalities are facing heckles, insults and criticism for their coverage this week of President Trump and the impeachment inquiry. And that’s just from their own colleagues. In an unusual airing of intramural grievances, Fox News anchors and pundits have let loose at one another in full public view — lobbing attacks across time slots and offering a rare glimpse into tensions behind the scenes at the top-rated cable news network. [Related:  Anchor Shepard Smith abruptly leaves Fox News .] In one striking exchange, a guest on Tucker Carlson’s prime-time show on Tuesday dismissed Andrew Napolitano, the veteran Fox News legal analyst, as a “fool” for saying Mr. Trump’s urging of a favor from the Ukrainian prime minister constituted a crime. Shepard Smith, the network’s chief news anchor, fired back the next afternoon, declaring it “repugnant” that a guest would insult a Fox News colleague — and adding, pointedly, that the remark had gone “unchallenged” by Mr. Carlson. Back on the air Wednesday night, Mr. Carlson gleefully extended the feud, mocking Mr. Smith’s comments and noting, “Unlike maybe some dayside hosts, I’m not very partisan.” (Mr. Smith, a nonpartisan news anchor, is often accused by Mr. Trump of a liberal bias.) The on-air bickering came as Fox News journalists embarked on a sensitive task: covering the details of Mr. Trump’s interactions with Ukraine even as their network’s star commentators have striven to dismiss the matter as a “witch hunt” led by Democrats. On Friday, Chris Wallace, the “Fox News Sunday” anchor, observed that the spin from Mr. Trump’s defenders “is not surprising, but it is astonishing, and I think deeply misleading.” Mr. Wallace did not specify which defenders he was referring to. But liberals were quick to point out that Fox News’s prime-time hosts have been among Mr. Trump’s most vocal allies in the past few days. On Thursday, Sean Hannity opened his Fox program by addressing, in his words, “the radical, destructive, delusional Democratic Party and the media mob, their allies in crime, which has now descended into complete and utter madness.” (Fox News said that Mr. Wallace was not referring to his prime-time colleagues.) Friction between Fox News’s news reporting staff and its pro-Trump lineup of prime time commentators is not new. Journalists in the network’s Washington bureau have grumbled about the president granting interviews to pundits like Mr. Hannity rather than the White House team. What was unusual was the spectacle of network personalities clashing on-air. Under the iron rule of its former chairman, Roger Ailes, overt conflict between hosts was quickly snuffed out. That Mr. Carlson and Mr. Smith traded jabs over 36 hours suggested that the Ailes style of harsh discipline had eroded at the network. Earlier in the week, an episode of the talk show “The Five” deteriorated after the liberal pundit Juan Williams suggested that his conservative co-hosts were echoing talking points from the White House. “Asking a foreign government to investigate a political rival is illegal,” Mr. Williams said, before his colleagues angrily shouted him down. “You get that from Media Matters, Juan?” one co-host, Greg Gutfeld, said in an angered tone, referring to an advocacy group that regularly denigrates Fox News. Even by the standards of “The Five,” it was a stinging exchange. Mr. Wallace, in his appearances Friday on Fox News, offered a grim analysis of Mr. Trump’s political standing, even as he made clear he did not view impeachment as inevitable. But he swatted down some of his colleagues’ suggestions that the  whistle-blower’s complaint  contained little of note. “To dismiss this as a political hack seems to be an effort by the president’s defenders to make nothing out of something, and there is something here,” Mr. Wallace said. At one point, the news anchor Sandra Smith challenged Mr. Wallace, saying that she did not see a clear offer of quid pro quo — “the exchange of something for value” — in the rough transcript of Mr. Trump’s call. Mr. Wallace arched a brow. “You don’t think that dirt on Joe Biden and Joe Biden’s son would be of value?” he asked. For all the trouble faced by Mr. Trump this week, Fox News’s viewership has remained high — in fact, higher than usual. On Thursday evening, “Hannity” was seen by more than four million live viewers, a milestone mark by prime time news standards and a rating that Mr. Hannity has achieved only a few times this quarter.
Good Friday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you?  Sign up here .) The start-up I.P.O. market has gone ice-cold It isn’t just Uber and WeWork that have struggled to get into the public markets. Wall Street has become  much more skeptical  of I.P.O.s by loss-making companies, the NYT reports, and the consequences could ripple through Silicon Valley and beyond. Consider the  most recent spate of bad news : • Peloton, the maker of home fitness bikes, saw its shares tumble 11 percent below their I.P.O. yesterday, one of the worst debuts of the year. • Endeavor, the entertainment conglomerate run by Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell, pulled its I.P.O. yesterday, after previously cutting the price range. “The rejection threatens Silicon Valley’s favored approach  to building companies,” the NYT writes. Buzzy businesses had relied on huge sums from venture capitalists to grow quickly. But if public market investors are increasingly disdainful of such companies, start-ups may find it harder to get funding in the first place. One big problem that public-market investors have is price.  Companies like Uber, WeWork and Peloton simply asked to be valued at too high a level. “Things have gone a bit nutty,” the venture capitalist Fred Wilson told the NYT. Possible solutions include  companies being more conservative in pricing their I.P.O.s and showing investors that they have a pathway to making money. Even Masa Son of SoftBank, one of the biggest start-up backers around, has started advocating for more sustainable business models. (More on that below.) The pushback isn’t necessarily a bad thing , if it helps cool an overheated venture-capital environment. “I think that’s very important for private markets,” Mr. Wilson added. ____________________________ Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin, Michael J. de la Merced, Lindsey Underwood and Stephen Grocer. ____________________________ Masa Son faces questions after WeWork’s meltdown For much of the past three years, Mr. Son, the founder of SoftBank, commanded fear and awe in the tech world because of his willingness to invest billions in start-ups. But WeWork’s troubles have  put that strategy into question , Peter Eavis and Michael write in the NYT. Mr. Son’s M.O. has been to plow huge sums  into start-ups, letting them grow even if they rack up big losses. It’s an approach shaped by an early $20 million bet on Alibaba, which earned a return of more than $100 billion. The humbling of Uber and WeWork has shown the strategy’s limits.  If those companies can’t go public at the lofty valuations SoftBank accepted, it could face punishing write-downs. SoftBank faces other challenges.  It paid $21.6 billion for Sprint in 2013, promising that it could become America’s biggest carrier. Instead Sprint has fallen behind, and SoftBank is counting on merging the company with T-Mobile. If that deal fails, the research analyst Craig Moffett warned, “there’s a very solid argument that Sprint’s equity is worthless.” Mr. Son appears to recognize the new reality.  At a retreat for companies backed by SoftBank last week, he said those businesses needed to be able to bring in enough revenue to more than cover expenses within a few years of going public. Wall Street Democrats fear Warren more than Trump As Senator Elizabeth Warren gains in the polls in the Democratic primary race, Democratic donors in the business world are wondering  whether they should sit out the 2020 elections  — or even back President Trump, Brian Schwartz of CNBC reports. Ms. Warren has proposed a wealth tax , and a new rule that would make private equity firms responsible for the debts and pension obligations of companies they acquire. One regional bank C.E.O.  is worried  that Ms. Warren would appoint a head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who “sides only with consumers,” would force banks to hold more capital and restrict lending, according to Emily Flitter of the NYT. And she’s gaining on Joe Biden , the current front-runner and a candidate who is courting the financial elite. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has continued to woo business moguls with policies like a huge corporate tax cut and a push to eliminate regulations. Democratic donors feel conflicted.  “You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’ ” one told Mr. Schwartz. Boeing asked too much of pilots The National Transportation Safety Board faulted Boeing and the F.A.A. for  many erroneous assumptions  they had made during the development of the 737 Max, Natalie Kitroeff of the NYT reports. After a monthslong investigation, the safety board concluded  that the company “underestimated the effect that a malfunction of new automated software in the aircraft could have on the environment in the cockpit,” Ms. Kitroeff writes. The system, known as MCAS, contributed to two crashes that killed 346 people. Pilots were not fully informed about how the software functioned until after the first crash. Boeing has said the accidents could have been avoided  if pilots had performed a standard emergency procedure. But the N.T.S.B. concluded that Boeing placed too much confidence in average pilots’ ability to recover, because it hadn’t considered the chaos that situation would introduce. “The safety board recommended  that the F.A.A. require Boeing and other manufacturers to consider the effect of multiple cockpit warnings when assessing how quickly pilots will respond to a malfunction,” Ms. Kitroeff adds. “It also suggested that the agency direct plane makers to develop technology that could diagnose a problem during flight and tell pilots what procedure to follow.” The N.T.S.B.’s recommendations are not binding , but the F.A.A. typically accepts them. Credit Suisse is investigating a big spying scandal The fate of executives at the Swiss bank who were “responsible for the bank’s most embarrassing scandal in recent years” will likely  be decided early next week , Jan-Henrik Foerster and Patrick Winters of Bloomberg write, citing unnamed sources. The bank hired private investigators to follow a former star banker , Iqbal Khan, after he decamped for UBS, out of fear that he might poach former colleagues. Mr. Khan noticed that his car was being followed  last week, and took pictures of his pursuers, according to Bloomberg. That led to a fight in which the men tried to take away his phone. Lawyers at the Swiss law firm Homburger have been “interviewing bank officials  and reviewing whether the surveillance was justified, legal and ethical,” Bloomberg adds. Meet the Murdoch fighting climate change Kathryn Murdoch, the wife of James Murdoch, is stepping into the spotlight to talk about  her environmental activism . It’s a rare moment, John Schwartz of the NYT writes: a member of the billionaire media clan claiming independence from “the more conservative arm of the family.” Her work involves “countering the efforts of those who block progress  by stoking partisan rancor or by attempting to muddy the scientific consensus” on climate change, Mr. Schwartz writes. That pits her against the Murdoch empire  and its crown jewel, Fox News. As Mr. Schwartz notes, “This could be awkward.” But Ms. Murdoch and her husband, the younger son of Rupert Murdoch, have given millions  to environmental causes over the years, and they’ve alluded to their differences in opinion with other relatives. James Murdoch  recently told The New Yorker:  “There are views I really disagree with on Fox.” Revolving door The Senate confirmed  Eugene Scalia , the son of the late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, as   Labor secretary .

Federal law  expressly states that it is illegal for “a person to solicit, accept, or receive” anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a United States election. Yet there stood President Trump outside the White House on Thursday, openly soliciting help from a foreign government for his re-election prospects by declaring  to the assembled press  that “China should start an investigation into the Bidens.” This, of course, after Mr. Trump has already become subject to an  impeachment inquiry  after implicating himself in a scheme to seek foreign help for his campaign in a conversation with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. This might seem self-defeating — “ self-impeaching ,” even. A United States president urging a foreign government to investigate his political rival would seem to be flagrantly violating the law, along with American notions of fair play and decency.  But this president is a master at what Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan called  defining deviancy down . One baldfaced presidential lie, once exposed, is an outrage; a thousand such lies is a statistic.  Mr. Trump and his defenders are  increasingly  taking the position  that what he did in pressuring the Ukrainian president was no big deal — the responsible course of action, even. Ergo, the  more governments  that Mr. Trump urges to do the same thing, the more normal, if not public-spirited, such aberrant presidential behavior will seem. The cynical marketing calculation — Mr. Trump’s favorite form of math — would seem to be that, as with previous administration outrages, the news media will grow weary, the public will grow numb, the Democratic inquisitors will appear ineffectual. Mr. Trump is also, of course, seeking to drag former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, down to his level and implicate them in the same kind of self-dealing that he and his own family stand accused of. This might work. But it also might not. There is no historical precedent for a president demanding that a foreign government investigate another American politician. If  Mr. Trump  has evidence of possible corruption overseas, his counsel should relay it to the Department of Justice and let the F.B.I. do its job, in coordination with its foreign counterparts. Instead, Mr. Trump used his telephone conversation with Mr. Zelensky to pressure him to do Mr. Trump a “favor” and consult with Rudy Giuliani, serving as Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer and unofficial envoy, and the attorney general, William Barr, about digging up dirt on the Bidens. At that time, the United States, under direct orders from the president, was withholding nearly $400 million in military aid appropriated by Congress to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian encroachment on its eastern border. Much remains unknown about how the various dots do or do not connect. But basic facts of the Ukraine approach are not in dispute. Nor can there be much question about what Mr. Trump so publicly asked China to do.  There is a certain twisted logic to the president’s approach.   M ultiple Republican lawmakers have stepped forward to declare the July 25 phone call, as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina put it,  “ a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger .” “I have zero problems with this phone call,” Mr. Graham said in a Sunday appearance on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” Among those hitting the same talking point have been Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin: “ We all kind of looked at it and said, ‘There’s nothing here.’ ” And Senator James Risch of Idaho: “ I saw nothing in the conversation that was inappropriate. We’re done here .”  This represents a stark reversal of Republicans’ position during the special counsel’s investigation of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. In that case, Republican lawmakers said that it would be troubling if there was clear evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Now, their new position seems to be: There can’t be anything untoward going on here because the president is being so blatant about soliciting foreign help. Indeed , Mr. Trump seems to be operating on the assumption that the more shameless his assault on democratic norms and laws, the more he can get away with. This is not how the system works, no matter how fervently Mr. Trump’s Republican defenders may wish it so. The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters  to the editor.

Senator Bernie Sanders has produced the biggest fund-raising quarter of the Democratic primary, as his campaign announced on Tuesday that  he had taken in $25.3 million over the last three months.  Now the big questions looming over the donor race are whether Senator Elizabeth Warren will surpass him, and whether former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will trail far behind.  Mr. Sanders’s  third quarter haul  is the latest demonstration of the rising power of small donors to reshape presidential politics. His campaign moved swiftly on Tuesday to assert his financial might, reserving his first television ads of the campaign — a two-week, $1.3 million buy in Iowa. Yet  President Trump displayed fund-raising might that far surpassed any of the Democrats . Republican Party officials said that his re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee had raised $125 million  over the last three months , a presidential fund-raising record. Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren have yet to share their much-anticipated totals. But Ms. Warren’s figure is prompting much speculation; she is widely expected to improve upon the $19 million that she raised last quarter as she has surged in the polls to become Mr. Biden’s leading rival. The expectations game is perhaps most fraught for Mr. Biden, whose efforts to fashion himself as the clear front-runner mean that any slippage from the top of the ranks represents a risk.  Which 2020 Democrats Raised the Most Money This Summer? We’re keeping track as the candidates file their third quarter fund-raising totals. Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have boycotted the big-money circuit, raising the possibility of a watershed moment: The two top fund-raisers in the Democratic Party might end up being candidates who have turned their backs on the established class of political bundlers and financiers who have held sway for decades. The third quarter is known as perhaps the toughest to raise money in, as big donors are often out of town vacationing in July and August while small contributors spend less time online in the summer. But the money totals are critical not only to set budgets, hire staff and run ads but also because they mark the last time in 2019 that campaigns must open their books, hardening public perception of viability — or lack of it — during a crucial three-month period. The quarter ended on Monday and campaigns have until Oct. 15 to share their financial figures. Those without enough money can be winnowed quickly from the field;  a half-dozen  Democratic candidates have already called it quits this year. “It dictates the narrative in the lead-up to the elections,” said Rufus Gifford, who served as finance director for President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign and has donated to multiple 2020 candidates. “The big game that’s going on inside the campaigns is how to manage expectations.” The string of fund-raising announcements began early Tuesday morning with Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who  announced that he had raised $19.1 million in the third quarter . It was a dip from the field-leading $24.9 million he posted in the previous quarter, but more than enough to fully fund his once-upstart campaign into this fall and winter. Mr. Buttigieg has developed a grass-roots following, pairing his 580,000 donors with an aggressive calendar of dozens of traditional fund-raising events. Senator Kamala Harris  announced an $11.6 million haul  — nearly matching her totals in the first two quarters. She was the only campaign to announce her cash on hand: nearly $10 million, down from $13.3 million at the end of June, meaning she spent more than she raised in the last three months. Mr. Biden raised $22 million in the last quarter, second to Mr. Buttigieg. But there are signs his fund-raising operation has slowed, particularly online, where Mr. Biden has  slashed his advertising budget . While Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders did not have to fill their calendars with fund-raisers, Mr. Biden raced across the country in the last three months, from Florida to California, Aspen to the Hamptons, holding more than 40 donor events. His wife, Dr. Jill Biden, headlined another dozen. This weekend, top Biden donors and bundlers have been invited to a retreat in Philadelphia to discuss the campaign’s next phase. Mr. Biden’s campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden. Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s business affairs, will play out. Some have  even discussed creating a super PAC , which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren’s rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured. Mr. Biden’s ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data. Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the “full picture” but declined to elaborate. A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had “unequivocally’’ raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon. [ Sign up for our politics newsletter  and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Steve Westly, a bundler for Mr. Biden in California, said that skeptics and critics place too much importance on any one measurement of Mr. Biden’s candidacy. “Every time someone is a front-runner, they say, ‘Oh my gosh, they’re not ahead in every straw poll, ahead in every state and every fund-raising report,’” Mr. Westly said. “The reality is you want to be in first place, which is where Joe Biden is.” Harold Schaitberger, a close Biden ally and president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which has endorsed Mr. Biden, compared the race to a schoolyard game of “king of the hill.” “If you’re the king and you’re on the hill, everybody else — in this case certainly within the Democratic candidates and the Republican Party — are doing everything they can to take you off the hill,’’ he said. “That’s the point of it.” He said he had “seen no indication of any concern” about resources. For Mr. Sanders, his $25.3 million quarter — which included his second biggest day for fund-raising of the campaign, on Monday — was a welcome reprieve from weeks of questions about his pathway as he has stagnated in the polls and has been passed on the left by Ms. Warren. (In one Iowa poll,  more of those who caucused with Mr. Sanders in 2016 said they planned to support Ms. Warren in 2020 than him .) “Media elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign,” said Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, “and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.” For Mr. Buttigieg, the third quarter was a period of rapid expansion: He went from zero field offices in the early states to 42, and his staff jumped to 400 people. Mr. Buttigieg, who began the year as a little-known mayor, has raised more than $51 million for the year, a remarkable sum for a newcomer to the national scene. But he has struggled to translate that cash into support beyond single digits in the polls. While Ms. Harris’s haul was similar to her previous quarters, she entered October on a far different trajectory. She began the quarter riding high from her June debate performance — raising $4 million in the last four days of that month — but had faded by late September,  promising to refocus on Iowa  amid  a staff shake-up . One other campaign announced its numbers Tuesday:  Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey raised more than $6 million , his best quarter yet. Ten days ago, in a gambit to draw attention and donations, Mr. Booker’s campaign said he would quit the race if he did not collect at least $1.7 million; he raised more than $2.1 million. The quarterly fund-raising report will be the first for Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas representative, since the shooting in his hometown of El Paso that appeared to give his candidacy fresh purpose. Andrew Yang, the New York executive running a web-savvy campaign centered on the idea of giving away $1,000 to every American every month, is expected to post by far his best haul of the campaign.
What a difference Ukraine makes. For months, Republicans gloated as Democrats  agonized and squabbled  over the question of impeaching President Trump. Should they? Dare they? Did the congressional investigations already taking place qualify as an impeachment inquiry? Grappling with a decision so monumental, and politically risky, the Democratic Party threatened to tear itself apart. Then came last week’s announcement by Speaker Nancy Pelosi that a  formal impeachment investigation  was moving forward in the House. Faster than you can say “whistle-blower,” the dynamic flipped. Democrats united behind the message that Mr. Trump, in soliciting a foreign government’s help to undermine one of his domestic political rivals, had left them no choice but to pursue such an inquiry. Republicans struggled to respond, with some of their arguments more creative — and coherent — than others. Among their efforts: Senator Lindsey Graham opted for a hard brushback: “To impeach any president over a phone call like this would be insane,” he  told CNN  last Wednesday, referring to the  July 25 conversation  between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. “There is no there there,” he  insisted on Fox News  hours later, warning that “if this is an impeachable offense — this phone call — God help the next person to be president of the United States.” The House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, tried a gentler version of this on CBS’s “60 Minutes,” saying he  interpreted  the call as “two leaders having admiration, not intimidation.” Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, turned the tables,  accusing  House Democrats of trying to “intimidate, bully and treat improperly” five State Department officials called to give depositions starting this week on the Ukraine affair. In a Sunday  appearance on CNN , Representative Jim Jordan dismissed the scandal as a plot by Democrats to bring down the president, before unleashing the unsubstantiated allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden that Mr. Trump has been pushing. It was a perfect execution of the popular “What about Biden!” dodge, in which defenders dismiss questions about Mr. Trump’s behavior while pivoting to insist that the  real  scandal is what Vice President Biden did. Fact check: No, it’s not. On Sunday , the presidential adviser Stephen Miller insisted that it is Mr. Trump who is the real “whistle-blower,” exposing the corruption of Democrats, while the whistle-blower who reported the Ukraine phone call was “a deep-state operative, pure and simple.” On Monday, Peter Navarro, the president’s trade adviser, denounced the impeachment inquiry as  “an attempted coup d’état,”  comparing House Democrats to Lavrentiy Beria, the head of the Soviet secret police under Joseph Stalin. Multiple Republicans pushed the idea that the whistle-blower wasn’t credible because much of the information in his report was secondhand and so should be dismissed as “ hearsay .” This message fails to address the fact that the official White House  summary  of the July 25 call supports the whistle-blower’s stated concerns (“I would like you to do us a favor though.…”).  For a couple of days, some apologists —  including Mr. Trump  — peddled a conspiracy theory, first floated by a conservative website, that the form the whistle-blower used to make his complaint had secretly been changed just days earlier to allow, for the first time, reporting based on secondhand information.  Not true.  The office of the  inspector general of the intelligence community  promptly  smacked it down . Mr. Trump has tried a bit of everything. He has attacked the whistle-blower’s account as a “political hack job”; he has likened the whistle-blower’s sources to spies and implied they should be executed for treason; he has accused Representative Adam Schiff, the Democrat in charge of the House Intelligence Committee’s Ukraine investigation, of  treason  and suggested he should be arrested; and he has circulated a quote from one of his evangelical surrogates saying that, if he is removed from office, “it  will cause  a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.” But such presidential rantings only further muddy the messaging waters. On Tuesday, Charles Grassley, the Republican who leads the Senate Finance Committee, issued a statement  in support of  the whistle-blower. “This person appears to have followed the whistle-blower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected,” Senator Grassley said. Worse still, a smattering of Republicans have declined to accept Mr. Trump’s contention that this is  “The Greatest Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!” Senator  Mitt Romney  pronounced the phone call “ deeply troubling ,” while Senator Ben Sasse called the whistle-blower complaint “ very troubling .” Representative Mike Turner  said  of the call, “That conversation is not O.K.” Representative Will Hurd  found  the whistle-blower’s complaint “concerning” and said lawmakers “need to fully investigate all of the allegations.” Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and Gov.  Phil Scott  of Vermont  expressed support  for the impeachment inquiry. If Republicans hope to defend the president’s actions — not an easy job, given the facts — they need to find a better message and a better strategy for delivering it. Or leave the job to Mr. Trump.

For months, Senator Bernie Sanders brushed off questions about his age, offering a simple, six-word mantra to those who doubt he’s energetic enough to run for president: “Follow me around the campaign trail.” But in the hours before the chest pains that led to an emergency procedure in a Las Vegas hospital, Mr. Sanders, 78, uttered a different, perhaps more telling, series of six words. “Get me a chair up here,” he said, turning to his deputy campaign manager on Tuesday, before sitting down in front of the crowd of 250 gathered for a fund-raiser in a Persian restaurant. “It’s been a long day here.” For months, Democrats have watched as a trio of septuagenarians commanded a majority of support in their crowded primary field: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., 76, Senator Elizabeth Warren, 70, and Mr. Sanders, have consistently led in the contest to face President Trump, 73, next year. Presidential campaigns always reflect the hopes and fears — or, as political strategists call them, the “kitchen table conversations” — of the voters who cast the ballots. And this year, along with health care costs and college affordability, stagnant wages and immigration, the contest also reflects another issue, one that strikes at the heart of a country where the highest share of the electorate will be older than 65 since at least 1970: How old is too old? Voters, who have watched candidates through debate stages and state party dinners, on sweaty stages and speed-walking across the state fair, corn dog in hand, do not generally want to say there is a ceiling. No one is too old to be doing this. They just are not sure they would want to be keeping up such a rigorous schedule in their 70s. Would you? Gerontologists and other experts in aging say there is simply no way to definitively address the question of an upper age limit on the rigors of the presidency. “There’s no answer. It’s unknowable,” said  Dr. Mark Lachs, co-chief of Geriatric and Palliative Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian . “It’s true that rates of physical and cognitive impairment are age dependent but there’s all kind of variability.” The averages paint a sobering picture: The average life expectancy in the United States is just under 79, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even as Americans live longer than ever before, about 85 percent of older adults have at least one chronic disease, and more than three-quarters have at least two. But despite the statistics, one person’s 70 can be another’s 60, Dr. Lachs said. And being 70 years old, he added, is not at all what it used to be.  “The yardstick gets moved every decade because the country is aging and medical care becomes better,” he said. “Age should not be a disqualification for the presidency.” That’s a message some voters happily believe, as they confront the realities of aging in their own lives. The number of Americans who plan to retire after age 66 has  steadily ticked up over  the past quarter century, with  a quarter saying they do not plan  to retire at all. “Seventy is the new fifty,” said Halliestine Zimmerman, a retired accountant from Greenville, S.C., who celebrated her 70th birthday in June, a week before Ms. Warren did. “You don’t really think I am at the end of my life span, you think more you are in the middle. I know what it is I want out of my life, and you know how to get it.” Ms. Zimmerman’s husband, whose age she would only give as “70 plus,” had a triple bypass several years ago and today he regularly plays tennis. “He’s doing fantastic, so a stent doesn’t bother me at all,” she said, of Mr. Sanders. “I don’t think he will stop campaigning, I don’t think he should — remember a lot of people don’t make it to his age.” But others worry that an older commander-in-chief would share the declines they have experienced in their own physical and mental abilities over the years. Discussions of aging have been all-but-inescapable on the campaign trail. Since he entered the race, Mr. Biden has been dogged by questions about his physical fitness and condition — concerns he has tried to alleviate by bounding through parade routes and shaking dozens of hands in steamy summer weather. Mr. Sanders keeps a blistering campaign schedule that often includes multiple events in multiple cities each day. And supporters of Ms. Warren gush about her vitality, bragging about the hundreds of selfies she takes with supporters after each appearance.  “I was just amazed that when you first came out here, Senator Warren, that you ran up those steps the way that you did, and all this energy and stamina that you have,”  Nikita L. Jackson, a Rock Hill, S.C., city councilwoman , said as she praised Ms. Warren to a crowd at a town hall event on Saturday.  None of the Democratic candidates have been particularly eager to delve into the details of their health. Aides to Mr. Sanders released a brief statement noting that he “was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted,” a fairly common procedure in the United States. Like his rivals, Mr. Sanders has not yet released his medical records, though all three have vowed to do so before the Iowa caucuses in February. With little actual medical information, even minor irregularities in how candidates appear have prompted a flurry of age-related speculation. When Mr. Sanders hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, his campaign explained that he had received a cut requiring stitches but stressed that he did not fall. Mr. Biden appeared to be moving his mouth in a strange fashion during the last debate, which led to questions about whether  he wore dentures . At Mr. Biden’s campaign events, voters question whether his verbal missteps can be attributed to his age. “He’s not as sharp as he might be,” said Carol Sobelson, 63, at a campaign event in Concord, N.H. “He’s done a lot for our country, he was a great vice president. He’s probably not my first choice.” Health, or the perception of a candidate’s health, is unlikely to be off the table in a campaign against Mr. Trump. In 2016, his supporters spliced together video footage of Hillary Clinton coughing and Mr. Trump often questioned her stamina, particularly after she abruptly left a ceremony in New York honoring the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. Already, Mr. Trump has started questioning Mr. Biden’s energy levels, nicknaming him “Sleepy Joe.” Nearly all Democrats prefer candidates in their 40s through 60s, according to surveys. When asked about the ideal age for a president, just 3 percent said the 70s, according to polling  released by Pew Research Center in May . Other  polls have shown  that Americans express more discomfort with a candidate in their 70s than one who is gay, Muslim or an independent. The two Democratic nominees who have won the White House since 1992 — Bill Clinton and Barack Obama — made generational change a key part of their winning campaign message. Both were the youngest in their primary fields. Katie Glueck and Sydney Ember contributed reporting from New York.

Good Monday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you?  Sign up here .) How private investors spoiled Uber and WeWork This year has seen a number of high-profile I.P.O. flameouts, with Uber, Lyft and the home-exercise bike maker Peloton dropping below their debut prices and WeWork pulling its offering. The venture capitalist Fred Wilson argues that the reason is simple:  Reality is setting in . Mr. Wilson argues that these companies were spoiled by the private markets: • Investors have been too eager to value many companies as software businesses, at 10 times revenues or more. “Now that narrative is falling apart,” Mr. Wilson writes. • Uber’s gross margins were 46 percent, while WeWork’s were 20 percent. By comparison, Zoom, which makes videoconferencing software, has 81 percent gross margins. • That disparity explains why Uber’s stock is down 33 percent from its I.P.O. price and WeWork’s stock sale fizzled — and Zoom’s stock has more than doubled since its debut. Many think the I.P.O. market has returned to normal , and that it’s not such a bad thing if Wall Street is more skeptical of these companies. “There’s a reset going on right now,” the finance professor Jay Ritter  told the FT . “Sanity has returned.” That means many businesses will stay private a bit longer.  Alan Felder, the head of private capital markets for Americas at UBS,  told Bloomberg  that they’ll most likely continue to raise money in the private markets. Our take: That may be true — for now.  There’s plenty of money available in late-stage venture capital funds like SoftBank’s Vision Funds. But these investors are increasingly demanding that companies show a path to making money, and it’s not clear how long their patience will last. ____________________________ Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin, Michael J. de la Merced, Lindsey Underwood and Stephen Grocer. ____________________________ Forever 21 goes bankrupt The retailer, which helped popularize fast fashion in the U.S.,  has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , Sapna Maheshwari of the NYT reports. It’s “a sign   of the eroding power of shopping malls  and the shifting tastes of young consumers,” Ms. Maheshwari writes. The retailer “experienced big success in the early 2000s  with its troves of merchandise that imitated of-the-moment designer styles at rock-bottom prices,” she adds. “But the company expanded too aggressively just as technology was beginning to upend its business.” Forever 21 will cease operations in 40 counties , including Canada and Japan, and will close up to 350 stores, including 178 in the U.S. Forever 21 plans to continue to operate its website  and hundreds of stores in the U.S., where it is a major tenant for mall owners, as well as stores in Mexico and Latin America. How Trump dragged Blackstone’s chief into a mess in Washington Steve Schwarzman, Blackstone’s co-founder and C.E.O., is known for being President Trump’s unofficial business emissary to Beijing. But the billionaire found himself  unwillingly pulled into the latest drama in the capital  — by the president himself. Mr. Trump said last week that he had discussed allegations  of Hunter Biden’s work in China with Mr. Schwarzman. The president, who accused Hunter Biden of securing $1.5 billion in investments from the Chinese, said he asked the Blackstone chief about the matter, but Mr. Schwarzman demurred from talking about it. A spokeswoman for Mr. Schwarzman told the WaPo:  “Steve never spoke to the president about Joe Biden or his family, nor has he had any conversations with the Chinese about Biden or his family.” (A spokesman for Joe Biden’s presidential campaign accused Mr. Trump of spreading mistruths about Hunter Biden.) It was an unusual position for Mr. Schwarzman , who has served as a prominent bridge between Washington and Beijing in their continuing trade discussions. And it’s a sign that not even the business world may escape the widening scandal over Mr. Trump’s focus on the Bidens — and the impeachment proceedings that have now arisen over it. More:  Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that the Ukraine whistle-blower is  expected to testify soon . Mr. Trump has demanded to  meet the whistle-blower . And how a  shadow foreign policy  effort led by Rudy Giuliani led to the impeachment showdown. There’s an online child sex abuse crisis Tech companies have disclosed a boom in online photos and videos of children being sexually abused,  an NYT investigation finds , “exposing a system at a breaking point and unable to keep up with the perpetrators.” Smartphone cameras, social media and cloud storage have made it easier  to create and share images and videos of abuse. A record 45 million illegal images were flagged last year alone. “Major tech companies  have stepped up surveillance  of their platforms and have found them to be riddled with the content,” Michael Keller and Gabriel Dance of the NYT report. But criminals are increasingly “going dark” to hide their tracks , the NYT adds. Among their tools: virtual private networks that hide their locations; encryption for their messages and hard drives; and posting on the so-called dark web, which is inaccessible to conventional browsers. “Some tech companies can take weeks or months to respond  to questions from the authorities, if they respond at all,” the NYT adds. “Law enforcement records shared with The Times show that Tumblr was one of the least cooperative companies.” “Facebook Messenger was responsible for nearly two-thirds of reports  in 2018. And earlier this year, the company announced that it planned to begin encrypting messages, which would make them even  harder to police .” U.S. is weighing a crackdown on Chinese listings The White House is considering  whether to block  Chinese companies from listing their shares on American stock exchanges, Alan Rappeport and Ana Swanson of the NYT report. That would be another escalation in President Trump’s trade war with Beijing. • “Details of how the United States would restrict Chinese companies from American stock markets were still being worked out and the idea remained in its early stages,” Mr. Rappeport and Ms. Swanson write, citing unnamed sources. • “As of the beginning of this year, 156 Chinese companies were listed on American exchanges and had a total market capitalization of $1.2 trillion, according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.” • “Supporters say the efforts would close longstanding loopholes that have allowed Chinese companies with links to its government to take advantage of America’s financial rules and solicit funds from American investors without proper disclosure.” • “Skeptics caution that the move could be deeply disruptive to markets and the economy and risk turning American investors and pension funds into another casualty of the trade war.” The head of the New York Fed is in the hot seat John Williams, who leads the Federal Reserve’s biggest regional bank, has drawn criticism for his handling of an obscure but important part of the lending market. Those critiques are mistaken,  he tells Jeanna Smialek of the NYT . • Some investors have criticized the New York Fed as moving too slowly when troubles first emerged in the so-called repo market, an important source of short-term funding for corporate America. Turmoil there pushed the Fed’s benchmark rate above its intended range. • In an interview, Mr. Williams defended the New York Fed’s actions. He told Ms. Smialek that data that is needed to decide a response to trouble in the repo market comes in slowly, delaying any move. • “It was all hands on deck. Everyone was working tirelessly to understand what was happening.” • To prevent further tumult in repos, Mr. Williams said, the New York Fed will consider raising the amount of capital it keeps in reserve to help stabilize markets, as well as more direct action to calm any turmoil there. SpaceX’s Starship rocket is (almost) ready for liftoff Elon Musk said  the prototype of the spacecraft  that SpaceX hopes will take the first humans to Mars will go for a crewless test run in the next month or two, Kenneth Chang of the NYT reports. The 164-foot-tall, stainless steel Starship rocket  can take off, reach an altitude of 12 miles and then return to land in one piece. “By making rockets more like other forms of transportation where the vehicle is not thrown away after one trip, the cost of going to space could plummet,” Mr. Chang writes. “It’s going to be pretty epic  to see that thing take off and come back,” Mr. Musk said at a SpaceX facility outside Brownsville, Tex., where the rocket is being built. “SpaceX has a steady business  putting satellites in orbit and carrying cargo to the International Space Station,” Mr. Chang reports. But it’s unclear how the company can make money from the Starship business. Mr. Musk says that the company could still meet the deadlines  it has set to land on the moon and Mars within the next few years. But Mr. Chang notes that the entrepreneur “has a history of setting aspirational schedules that turn out to be too optimistic.” Revolving door Wells Fargo named  Charlie Scharf , the C.E.O. of Bank of New York Mellon, as its  new chief executive .
