But we will WIN!\" With that, President Donald Trump compared the impeachment inquiry -- a process laid out in the US Constitution -- to the violent, hate-driven murders of black people that stain America's history books. The comparison quickly evoked a bipartisan backlash. Among those slamming Trump's word choice were Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who last month tweeted an apology for invoking the same term in 1998 while discussing then-President Bill Clinton's impeachment. Step outside the politics for a moment.  The act of lynching was, and remains, a horrific reality.  Thousands, most of them black, were lynched The violence and horror of lynchings in the United States cannot be overstated. In our country's not-so-distant history, thousands of Americans -- most of them black -- were hanged, shot or dragged to death behind a vehicle.  Some were burned alive. Even as research varies on the time frame and location of recorded lynchings, it's widely accepted that lynchings were not random crimes but almost always involved a hateful, violent mob acting outside the law against a single person.  While lynchings began in the American frontier as a method of vigilante justice for legitimate crimes, the \"institution was turned into a weapon of white supremacy by the 1880s,\" said RJ Ramey, the main researcher and creator of Monroe Work Today. It's a project that maps historical lynchings and is named after Monroe Work, the son of former slaves who researched discrimination at Tuskegee Institute. Attackers' reasons tended to be contrived -- deeming perfectly legal actions by a black person to be out-of-line, according to Monroe Work Today.  Examples include a black person refusing to call a white man \"sir,\" suing a white man in court or being seen in a white woman's bedroom, Ramey told CNN. The last scenario was considered rape, though it was more likely evidence of a consensual, interracial relationship, he said. \"They were transgressing the idea that black people should always be deferential to white men,\" Ramey said.  Killings often were based on false evidence Accusations made against black people were often based on false evidence, though. Fourteen-year-old Emmett Till, as one vivid example, was lynched in Mississippi after a white woman claimed he made a pass at her. The woman's claims were later revealed to mostly be a lie.  Stunningly, the violence against Till's memory continues. A memorial sign in Mississippi marking his death has been repeatedly riddled with bullet holes and is now covered with bulletproof glass. Of black lynching victims between 1880 and 1930, almost 25% were accused of sexual assault and nearly 30% were accused of murder, according to research cited by the Equal Justice Initiative, or EJI, which in 2018 opened the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, a monument to lynching victims in Montgomery, Alabama.  Hundreds more were lynched based on accusations of robbery, arson, simple assault and vagrancy, the report states; the crimes would not typically have resulted in a death sentence. The claims were often fueled by racist stereotypes of black men as \"dangerous, violent and uncontrollable sexual aggressors.\"  \"It's very obvious that these (cases) were cover stories for ulterior motives,\" Ramey said, adding that jealousy or vengeance often fueled lynch mobs' motives. The first well-publicized lynching, for example, followed a false story about a planned slave uprising. It resulted in the hangings in 1835 of several enslaved black people and two white men, according to the EJI's report. That event served as a milestone to mark the start of a spike in lynchings, particularly in the South. They became a public spectacle Between 1830 and 1860, at least 400 enslaved black people and 130 white people died at the hands of Southern mobs, and the number grew along with suspicions of slave uprisings, the EJI reported. Public spectacle lynchings also grew more frequent. Large crowds of white people would watch as black victims were tortured, mutilated or burned at the stake, according to the EJI. Through the 1920s, public lynchings were \"literally part of society,\" Ramey told CNN.  \"These were events that would often be delayed for a few hours so people could come and watch,\" he said. Train companies were known to run more trains on days of lynchings to ferry in residents of outlying communities, Ramey continued. Between 1877 and 1950, more than 4,000 black people were lynched in the United States, the EJI found.  By another measure, black people accounted for about 73% of those lynched between 1882 and 1968, according to the NAACP.  \"Through lynching, Southern white communities asserted their racial dominance over the region's political and economic resources -- a dominance first achieved through slavery would now be restored through blood and terror,\" the EJI report states. Co-opting the term is frowned upon While some argue that modern lethal violence motivated by racism can be described as lynching, the term sometimes gets co-opted to describe a rhetorical attack.  Opponents of the nation's first anti-lynching laws accused civil rights advocates of \"lynching the Constitution.\" Justice Clarence Thomas famously decried his Supreme Court confirmation process as a \"high-tech lynching.\" And of course, Trump used the term to slam the impeachment process.  Sen. Lindsey Graham defended the President's word choice, saying it doesn't imply racist intent.  \"African Americans have (been) lynched, other people have been lynched throughout history,\" he said Tuesday. \"What does lynching mean? That a mob grabs you, they don't give you a chance to defend yourself, they don't tell you what happened to you, they just destroy you. That's exactly what's going on in the United States House of Representatives right now.\" But other Republicans wouldn't stand for it.  \"I don't agree with that language. It's pretty simple,\" House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy said.  \"Given the history in our country, I would not compare this to a lynching,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. \"That was an unfortunate choice of words.\" Casting oneself as a lynching victim when the literal definition doesn't fit also \"undercuts an honest reckoning with America's past,\" writes Emory University history professor Jason Morgan Ward for CNN. \"Claiming the identity of a lynching victim is an outrageous distraction from and diminishment of the suffering of the many thousands who died at the hands of bloodthirsty mobs -- spurred, in many cases, by the racial demagogues of that day,\" he states. \"We honor their memory by saying their names; we debase their brutal, shameful treatment by claiming to be them to glibly score rhetorical points.\"", "sourceId": "article_B49569BD-0238-08BE-7130-F5B55C030FF4", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/us/lynchings-history-trnd/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-10-23T20:18:03Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-10-23T20:18:03Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-10-23T20:18:03Z", "path": "/2019/10/23/us/lynchings-history-trnd", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Leah Asmelash, CNN", "contributors": [], "headline": "'Lynching' isn't a euphemism for unwanted criticism.

The American Jewish Committee (AJC), a Jewish advocacy organization, released the results of its survey Wednesday. It was  conducted with 1,283 respondents over almost a month. It found that nearly a third of those polled have \"avoided publicly wearing, carrying or displaying things that might help people identify them as Jews.\" And a quarter of respondents said they avoid places, events or situations out of concern for their safety or comfort. The statistics come nearly a year after a man opened fire in a synagogue in the historic Jewish neighborhood of Squirrel Hill during Saturday morning worship. The suspect is facing federal hate-crime charges. And in April of this year -- on the last day of Passover -- a gunman killed one woman and wounded three others at Congregation Chabad in Poway, California. The injured included an 8-year-old girl and her uncle, who was visiting from Israel. Those horrific incidents were among many other recent instances of anti-Semitism. Last year had the third-highest totals for assault, harassment and vandalism against Jews since the Anti-Defamation League started tracking such incidents in 1979, according to the organization. There were a total of 1,879 attacks against Jews and Jewish institutions across the country, according to a report from the ADL. The AJC survey suggests Jewish Americans are feeling the impact of these attacks. Nearly nine out of 10 say anti-Semitism is a current problem in the US, and 72% say they do not approve of the Trump administration's handling of the threat, according to the survey. \"American Jews could not be clearer about the reality of anti-Semitism in the U.S.,\" said AJC CEO David Harris. \"This hatred is real, comes from multiple sources, and is growing. It needs to be taken seriously and dealt with in a sustained, multi-pronged response.\" The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.

Impeachment inquiry\u00a0 Was there a quid pro quo or wasn't there a quid pro quo? That's one of the biggest questions in this impeachment inquiry, and testimony from Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, seems to point toward \"yes.\" Taylor informed House Democrats yesterday that\u00a0he was told\u00a0the release of military aid to Ukraine would depend on a pledge to probe the 2016 election and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Dems are calling the admission a smoking gun and a \"sea change\" that may alter the course of the impeachment process and make it even more complicated. For instance, Taylor's testimony contradicts the claims of\u00a0Gordon Sondland, the\u00a0US ambassador to the European Union. Sondland said the President\u00a0had told him there was no quid pro quo, whereas all Taylor's testimony was missing was, well, the Latin itself. Some Democrats wondered aloud whether Sondland should return to Capitol Hill for another round of questions. Meantime, Trump referred to the impeachment process to a \"lynching,\" drawing criticism from both parties.  2. Chicago teachers strike\u00a0 Today will be the fifth day of a massive teachers strike in Chicago that's affecting about 300,000 students. The Chicago Teachers Union and city officials are deadlocked and blaming each other for the strike. On one side, the union\u00a0has asked for\u00a0smaller class sizes, more support staff and higher raises for all educators. In response, the\u00a0city has offered some concessions\u00a0but said it can't afford to fulfill all the union's demands. The stalemate is leaving students and their parents searching for alternative ways to spend the school day. Though 25,000 educators are involved in the strike, public school buildings remain opened and staffed by non-union workers. The\u00a0Chicago Transit Authority is giving free rides to students during the day, and community centers, museums and cultural centers are offering educational programs as a school-day substitute. 3. Hong Kong  A murder suspect whose criminal case sparked the massive protests in Hong Kong is free on minor charges. Authorities say Chan Tong-kai, now 20, admitted to killing his girlfriend in 2018 in Taiwan and was later arrested in Hong Kong. But Taiwan and Hong Kong have no extradition agreement, and prosecutors in Hong Kong couldn't charge Chan with murder, so they charged him with money laundering for alleged thefts linked to the killing. Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, wanted to plug the extradition \"loophole\" with Taiwan, but her attempts sparked fear that such a law could be used to drag critics of Beijing across the border to face trial. The protests since have ballooned to include other political grievances and affected everything from NBA teams to the US-China trade war. As for Chan, he's offered to turn himself in to Taiwanese authorities. Trying to facilitate that exchange would be another political test. 4. Russia and Turkey\u00a0 Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met yesterday to broker a deal regarding Syria's civil war. The main focus of the discussion was the border between Turkey and Northern Syria. Under the agreement,\u00a0there will be a roughly 18-mile\u00a0\"safe zone\" on the border, and Kurdish forces will stay south of it, with the\u00a0Russian military police and Turkish military patrolling the line. Not included in this negotiation? The US. The whole affair made it clear that Turkey and Russia are not interested in including the US in plans regarding Syria's future. Furthermore, after the recent withdrawal of US troops from the area signaled what many called a betrayal\u00a0of their Kurdish allies, it appears Russia will be the Kurds' new powerful protector in the area. 5. ExxonMobil trial Energy giant ExxonMobil is on trial this week for allegedly\u00a0misleading investors about the potential impact of climate change regulations on its operations. The New York attorney general brought the suit against the company\u00a0and claims the alleged fraud may have cost investors $1.6 billion. The suit alleges ExxonMobil calculated the cost of regulations that would impact demand for oil and gas, like fuel economy rules and\u00a0alternative energy subsidies. It then allegedly fudged\u00a0the figures\u00a0to misrepresent how carbon regulation would affect investors.\u00a0Ex-US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was the CEO of ExxonMobil during the years in question\u00a0and is expected to testify in the trial.

prolonging the teachers' strike. As the stalemate continues, some students are playing board games or making origami instead of learning in class -- and some parents are torn about which side to support. \"I support both sides, but I think they need to come to a mutual agreement and give a little on both sides because they're only hurting the kids,\" said Dominique Williams, the mother of two teens on the city's tough west side.  The union wants smaller class sizes, more support staff and higher raises for all educators. The city has offered some concessions, but said it can't afford to meet all their demands.  See what the teachers' union wants Former teacher Elizabeth Warren joins the picket lines Teachers got a boost of support Tuesday from Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"Everyone in America should support you in this strike,\" said Warren, herself a former teacher.  \"The reason is because when you go out and fight, you don't just fight for yourselves. You fight for their children of this city, and the children of this country. I believe in public education. I believe it is time in America to make a new investment in public education.\" One of the greatest needs is for more social workers in schools. That's especially true in Chicago, where many students struggle with poverty, violence and grief at a very young age. \"Everything is so different from the way it used to be. It seems like things are just getting more and more chaotic as the years go by,\" Williams said.  \"A lot of these kids do need help. ... Some of these kids do need that social worker because they can't talk to their parent.  Or they can't talk to their friend. So they'll talk to that social worker because it's a separate entity away from what they got going on.\" One school social worker said she has to split her time between four buildings and 1,039 students.  \"I'm tired of telling kids that I can only be there 1 1/2 days of the entire week,\" she said. \"We can't plan our crises according to when I'm there.\"  Darian Martyniuk, the father of two elementary school students, said he appreciates what the teachers are fighting for. But they may be asking too much from Chicago Public Schools.   \"While I think the teachers have some noble and worthy demands that need to be addressed, I think the union leadership is at best behaving cynically, at worst using whatever leverage they think they have to squeeze the most out of a system that doesn't have anything left to give,\" Martuniuk said.   \"Additional staffing like librarians, nurses, counselors ... there are legitimate teacher needs for more. But the union leadership doesn't seem to understand the finance structure of CPS and how it is a limited pool of money. You can't just keep raising taxes year after year because legally they can't do that.\" 'I'm pissed,' one mother says Mayor Lori Lightfoot said even though she and the union want some of the same things, it's time for the union to stop striking.  \"There is a finite pot of money. We don't have unlimited cash to keep funding the things that are aspirational and maybe things that, on values that we share,\" Lightfoot said.  \"We have to live within our means. That's what the taxpayers expect of us, and that's what we're going to do.\" See what Chicago Public Schools has offered the teachers Williams, the mother who has two teens on the city's west side, said the dueling sides need to stop bickering.   \"I'm pissed at the fact that the kids have been out for so long,\" she said. \"They need their class time.\" During Tuesday's bargaining, CTU Chief of Staff Jennifer Johnson said 25 coaches took part in a \"powerful meeting,\" during which they called for more investment in equipment, uniforms and transportation and more pay for coaches. Union officials and schools officials also discussed class sizes and staffing, she said. \"There was progress but we're still clear that we have not landed on just terms yet,\" Johnson said. \"We are clear that we're looking for a substantial investment that addresses our members and students' concerns.\"  Johnson said picket lines will be suspended Wednesday as parents, teachers, students and allies plan to converge on downtown Chicago for a rally.

The 1-5 scale estimates potential property damage.  A Category 3 or higher is considered a major hurricane.  The National Hurricane Center advises preparedness: A hurricane watch indicates the possibility that a region could experience hurricane conditions within 48 hours.\nA hurricane warning indicates that sustained winds of at least 74 mph are expected within 36 hours. Hurricane names are pulled from six rotating lists maintained and updated by the World Meteorological Organization. Storm names are retired only when those storms are particularly deadly or costly.

The Chicago Teachers Union and city officials negotiated through the weekend but couldn't reach a deal. On Monday, about 10 different proposals on various issues went back and forth, a senior city official told CNN. The Chicago Teachers Union enlisted the help of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who attended a bargaining session, to mediate. A Democratic presidential candidate will add her voice in support of the teachers. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is set to join Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union, and educators on the picket lines on Tuesday, the union said. Bargaining resumes Tuesday, the Chicago Teachers Union said.  Chicago Teachers Union members gave Mayor Lori Lightfoot a grade of 'F' for the latest round of negotiations, union president Jesse Sharkey told reporters Monday night. \"The mayor has dashed our hopes for a quick settlement,\" Sharkey, said citing a letter Lightfoot sent to the union urging them to end the strike as negotiations continue.  \"We are not going back to work without a legally binding agreement,\" Sharkey said. Lightfoot's letter, which was shared on the union's Twitter account, said in part: \"The students and families of Chicago cannot afford to be out of school for any longer, which is why we are asking you to end the strike and encourage your members to return to work while bargaining continues.\"  \"Our team has been turning around thoughtful counteroffers at a rapid pace. We are hopeful that CTU will meet that pace ... so we can bring this process to a fair and responsible end.\" The union's demands echo what teachers across the country are fighting for: smaller class sizes, more support staff, higher raises and more school funding.  But the mayor and Chicago Public Schools say it's just not realistic to fund everything the union wants.   \"CPS is not flush with cash,\" the mayor said. \"The fact is there is no more money. Period.\"  'Tragedies waiting to happen'  Chicago teachers say they're fighting for students who often face dire challenges.  About 75% of their students qualify for free or reduced lunch. In some neighborhoods, gangs and violence permeate the streets, forcing children to grapple with grief at a very young age. Nine of 10 majority-black schools have no librarians, and there aren't enough bilingual teachers in a district that's \"nearly half Latinx,\" the union said.  And many schools don't have a full-time nurse.  \"There (are) just tragedies waiting to happen because we don't have enough staff in our schools,\" nurse Dennis Kosuth told CNN affiliate WLS.  Last year, Kosuth had to split his time among six schools. \"It was impossible for me to give the kind of care that I wanted to give to my students,\" he said.  This year, he's working at three different schools. \"But I'm still just as busy.\" Hiring more social workers, counselors, nurses, bilingual teachers and librarians is just part of of the union's demands.  Teachers also want smaller class sizes, higher pay for all school employees and more teacher prep time during the school day.  More than 41,000 Chicago elementary school students are trying to learn in classes with 30 students or more, the union said. Of those, 5,290 are in classes with at least 35 students.  And from the elementary to high school levels, CTU said, some classes have more than 40 students.  A bit of progress Chicago Public Schools has offered to steadily raise teachers' salaries to an average of $97,757 by fiscal year 2024.    \"We will also ensure every school has a full-time nurse by 2024,\" CPS said.  It said it would also commit another 200 social workers and special education case managers for the highest-need schools over the next three years.  A veteran teacher's aide makes less than $30,000 a year and must work other jobs CPS' latest offer would also raise the salaries of teachers' assistants, nurses and clerks every year for the next five years.  But the challenge isn't just funding those new positions -- it's finding enough quality applicants.   \"Social workers, nurses, counselors, and other similar positions are hard to hire,\" the school district said. \"The candidate pool is limited, and hiring is competitive.\"  Last month, the union asked for \"CPS to hire more than 1,000 new employees by October 1, 2019, across several hard-to-find specialties,\" the school district said.  \"The (union's) proposal also calls for hiring approximately 3,000 more employees over the next two years at a cost of more than $800 million. Even if CPS could realistically afford such a commitment, it would be nearly impossible to meet those hiring goals.\"  After lengthy negotiations Saturday, the teachers' union said both sides are getting closer to an agreement -- but sticking points remain.  \"We have tentative agreements on eight different items -- two in particular, I think, are huge,\" CTU Vice President Stacy Davis Gates said.  \"One goes with the pipeline for teachers of color,\" which could help reverse \"the precipitous decline of black teachers,\" she said.   \"The other one that's huge is that over the life of the contract, we effectively have a charter (school) moratorium.\" While many parents have joined teachers on the picket lines, some oppose the strike.  \"To me, it's a whole distraction and interruption to the school year,\" said Liam Boyd, the father of a fourth grader at Blaine Elementary School.  \"I don't support the union. I think the school district and the city has been more fair this time and (are) trying to be more fair.\" The union's president, Jesse Sharkey, said he has two children in the school district.  \"We understand that a strike is a disruption to the parents of the city,\" Sharkey said. \"It's worth a short-term disruption if that puts in place over the long-term the conditions that make education better in this city.\" ", "sourceId": "article_34B0619A-02EA-B269-9A74-E901BACCEDF3", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/21/us/chicago-teachers-strike-monday/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-10-21T10:29:15Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-10-22T04:11:35Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-10-22T17:52:40Z", "path": "/2019/10/21/us/chicago-teachers-strike-monday", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Holly Yan, CNN", "contributors": ["Holly Yan"], "headline": "Chicago's teacher strike heads into another week, with no end in sight.

The 2-year-old girl was killed Sunday afternoon when somebody fired a rifle into a home in Kensington, in northern Philadelphia. She was hit in the back of the head and pronounced dead at the scene, police said. The girl's mother was holding her at the time and sustained a gunshot wound to her arm and a grazing wound to her head, police said. A man in the home, who police said was there to clean carpets, was shot in the abdomen and is in critical condition. Also inside the house were the slain girl's grandmother and three other small children. Philadelphia Police Captain Jason Smith told reporters Monday the 7.62 mm rifle rounds found at the house appeared to match rounds fired minutes earlier at a black SUV several blocks away, and were likely fired by the same weapon. \"You should always feel that you are OK in your home, and you should feel that when you're with your parents you're safe.\" said Acting Philadelphia Police Commissioner Christine Coulter at a Monday press conference. \"These scenes should not continue to happen in our city. We're a great city, and we need to do better. We have to do better.\" The 11-month-old was shot four times while sitting inside a vehicle around 8 p.m. Saturday in Philadelphia's Hunting Park area, police said. That child was hit once in the head, once in the neck and twice in the buttocks with 9 mm rounds, Philadelphia Police Captain Nicholas Brown told reporters Monday. \"As it stands right now, the child's in very, very, very critical condition,\" Brown said. \"The prognosis is that there will be no chance for full recovery for that child, and if the child survives, it will most likely be a quadriplegic.\" A preliminary investigation indicated the bullets hit the rear of the car and traveled through the trunk before striking the baby. Besides the driver, there may have been another person in the car who might have been the intended target, Brown said. The motive was unclear in both shootings. \"We need people to give us information on who these folks are,\" Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said to reporters. \"I know people are concerned and afraid-- but when it comes to children I think we need to have this information so we can lock these people up and get them off the street.\" Kenney also called for legislation at the state and federal levels to limit the flow of firearms. \"Philadelphians should not live in fear of violence that could take away a child's life,\" Kenney said in a tweet Sunday evening. \"But for too many, this is a sad reality. With the unabated flow of illegal guns and drugs, we must do whatever we can locally to address violence and help residents.\" 'We can't protect our children' There have been more than 270 homicide victims in the city of Philadelphia this year, according to statistics by Philadelphia police.  \"I'm physically sick because just as a nation we can't protect our children,\" Pennsylvania state Rep. Movita Johnson-Harrell told CNN.  \"It's not drug wars, it's not gang wars, it's petty thieves, it's people with no common sense and easy accessibility to guns. They don't know how to resolve their problems so they use guns... what they're doing is catching a whole lot of innocent people in the cross fire.\" The representative said she is hopeful legislators will \"be doing something very shortly\" in terms of gun violence in Philadelphia. \"The people that make the decisions and hold the purse strings need to put themselves in the position of these families who now have to bury their loved ones,' she said. \"This can't continue to be business as usual or politics as usual.\" Another state representative weighed in on Twitter.  \"Two babies were shot this weekend in Philadelphia,\" Rep. Jordan A. Harris said in a Sunday night tweet.

But teams still have a long road ahead, and it's not getting any easier with tight playoff races across both conferences. Here are three things to watch for this NFL Sunday: 1. Eagles and Cowboys clash for NFC East lead  The rivalry between the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys runs deep. The games of the 1980s got so violent that then-Eagles coach Buddy Ryan was accused of placing a bounty on the heads of Cowboy players. There's nothing that intense this year, but Sporting News ranked the clash between the NFC East rivals as the best in the game, even ahead of the combative Bears-Packers. One might not think the contest between two 3-3 squads would be that exciting, but the division lead is on the line. The Eagles have suffered an inconsistent season, while the Cowboys are reeling after three straight losses that followed three opening wins. With key players missing on offense, it's been a tough few games for Cowboys QB Dak Prescott, who has thrown four interceptions compared to two touchdowns during the losing streak. \"With injuries or without injuries, you can't get in your own way, and that's what we've continuously done. Great teams don't do that,\" Prescott recently told reporters.  Prescott will go against fellow 2016 draftee, Carson Wentz, under center for the Eagles. The QB for Philadelphia has had a better statistical season then Prescott. That might be why Philadelphia head coach Doug Pederson all but guaranteed a win for his team, despite two losses to Dallas last year.  Watch: Philadelphia Eagles vs. Dallas Cowboys at 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC 2. Detroit seeks redemption as Lions and Vikings battle After Detroit's recent loss against the Green Bay Packers, former Lions great Barry Sanders tweeted that the \"Lions played too well to have the game end this way.\" He was referring to calls by the referees, that even the NFL agreed were bad. But the referees aren't entirely to blame for Detroit's struggles. The team has a knack for blowing leads, giving up an 18-point advantage in the first game of the season before allowing the Packers to come back from 13 down last week. They've been unlucky as well, from a first-week tie to last Sunday's last-second defeat. The Lions are hoping to catch a break against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, a team that hasn't won outside of their home stadium. But it won't be easy, as the Vikings are confident after winning two straight games.  Watch: Detroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings at 1:00 p.m. ET on Fox 3. Battle of the Birds: Seahawks vs Ravens  Despite playing in different conferences, the Seattle Seahawks and Baltimore Ravens have a lot in common. The teams represent coastal cities, features birds as their mascots and have top five offenses. The Ravens lead the league in yards per game, and the Seahawks aren't far behind in fifth place. But the real story is their quarterbacks. The Seahawks have the steady Russell Wilson under center, one of the strongest quarterbacks in the league. The 5-foot-11, 215-pound signal caller is known for his strong passing, but also being able to tuck the ball and run. Wilson has emerged as an MVP candidate this season, having thrown 14 touchdowns and no interceptions, not to mention running in three more scores.   Meanwhile, the Raven's Lamar Jackson is a 6-foot-2 string-bean known for his feet, as the second-year man from Louisville ran for over 1,500 yards during his final two years in college. \"I take advantage...I'm trying to win at the end of the day. If I gotta run, I gotta do it,\" Jackson recently told reporters. That's not to say Jackson can't throw, in fact, he prefers it. His arm has been instrumental in leading the team to a 4-2 record.  The QBs will go head-to-head this Sunday in what promises to be a showdown of a current great against an up-and-comer. It's anyone's guess who'll come out on top.

PERIOD.\" It's a sentiment some African Americans are expressing on social media and elsewhere since Atatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old black woman, was shot and killed last weekend by a Fort Worth, Texas, police officer who was conducting a wellness check at her home.  DJ Cunningham, a clinical psychology doctoral student in New Jersey, called Jefferson's fatal shooting an \"eye-opener.\" In an interview with CNN, he said the incident -- and the 2018 accidental killing of a black man in his home by a Dallas police officer -- have made him more cautious at home.  \"This could easily be me. Someone could stumble into the wrong apartment after a long shift and 'bam' -- I'm not able to talk to my mom again,\" said Cunningham, who urged his followers on Twitter to never call the cops if they wanted to check on him.  \"It makes you recognize your blackness,\" he added. \"You're almost instantly seen as a threat as opposed to a kid or another member of society.\" For many black Americans, Jefferson's fatal shooting has revealed yet another sobering facet of modern life. Blacks have long feared interactions with police while driving. And recent years have seen a litany of incidents in which African Americans have been questioned or detained by police while going about their daily business. But now some blacks say they are increasingly worried about the dangers of confronting police in their own homes.  Achmat Akkad, a mental health first aid teacher in New York, told CNN he's experienced wellness checks himself. Often officers respond as if the people they are checking on have done something wrong, he said. \"Just their presence when you open your door, especially as a black male, that can be very frightening,\" he said.  For these Americans and others, it creates yet another layer of mistrust between law enforcement and the black community. It's not the first time this type of thing has happened In recent years there have been other incidents, similar to Jefferson's, in which black people were killed during a wellness check. One of them was the 2011 shooting death of Kenneth Chamberlain Sr., a 68-year-old former Marine with a severe heart condition who accidentally set off a medical-alert pendant. When police showed up at his White Plains, New York, apartment, they say he refused to open the door. A police report states Chamberlain stuck an 8-inch butcher knife through a crack in the door and jammed it shut with a chair when officers tried to enter. Police then forced open the door and used a Taser, bean-bag bullets and finally live bullets after Chamberlain approached an officer with the knife raised. In 2015 James Allen, a 74-year-old Army vet from Gastonia, North Carolina, was killed by a police officer after firefighters forced his door open during a wellness check, CNN affiliate WSOC reported. An officer shot Allen after the vet pointed a gun at him. \"I think that he probably thought somebody was breaking in his house or robbing him,\" Allen's sister, Mary Battle, told the TV station. Douglas Harris, a 77-year-old Birmingham, Alabama, man, was shot by police in February 2015 after officers went to his apartment for a wellness check. Harris' son had asked for the safety check, the Birmingham News reported, but Harris answered the door holding a gun aimed at an officer. Harris died a month after he was shot.\nAnd last year 36-year-old Travis Jordan was killed by two Minneapolis police officers at his home after his girlfriend called 911, fearful he was going to kill himself, CNN affiliate WCCO reported. Jordan refused to come to the door when officers arrived, then stepped onto his porch holding a knife. After he stepped toward the officers, they opened fire.  It's not clear if race is the reason Are black people really more in danger of being killed during a wellness check?  There hasn't been enough research on the subject to prove that, says Johnny Nhan, a criminal justice professor at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. He says it's complicated because there are lots of factors that can turn a wellness check into a police shooting, such as if the person is armed, if they attack an officer or if they have a mental illness. \"In general, however, if you're talking about police bias against blacks and other minorities, that has been an ongoing issue that we're still trying to understand,\" Nhan told CNN. \"There has been research in the past few years on implicit bias and the idea that black people are perceived of as more dangerous than whites.\" Jefferson was playing video games with her nephew in the back bedroom of her home late at night when they heard noises coming from outside, according to court documents. She then pulled her handgun from her purse, her nephew told police, and was pointing it toward a window when she was shot by an officer who was outside the house. Nhan says the officers seemed to approach the situation at Jefferson's house as being more dangerous than just a run-of-the-mill wellness. \"The officer(s) I'm guessing is thinking this is 2:30 at night, the door is open, etc. This may be something they have seen before with something related to crime and danger, so their approach would be to assume it's a dangerous situation, such as a burglary,\" Nhan said. \"So in other words, it's difficult to say if and how much race has to do with these.\" Authorities are looking into what Aaron Dean, the Fort Worth police officer who killed Jefferson, and his partner were told before arriving at her home. \"The information came from the neighbor to the call-takers and while it was relayed to the dispatch, it was determined to be an 'open structure' call,\" Fort Worth interim Police Chief Ed Kraus told reporters earlier this week. Experts say the classification of an \"open structure\" call -- about a home or building with a door left open -- escalated things beyond a wellness check and meant the officers would respond differently. Dean resigned from the department on Monday, just hours before he was arrested and charged with murder. If Dean had not resigned, he would have been fired for several policy violations, including the department's use of force and de-escalation policies, and unprofessional conduct, Kraus said. It's in law enforcement's best interest to fix this It's important to law enforcement's legitimacy to get a handle on these types of incidents, Cedric L. Alexander, a past president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, wrote in an op-ed for CNN Digital. \"Every police executive and every police officer knows, or should know, that while the law gives them their official authority, it is the public who gives them their legitimacy, which is their more immediate authority -- their street authority,\" Alexander writes.  \"Legitimacy is granted when people are confident that the police are competent, just, reasonable, fair and courageous. Most of all, people want to be safe in their homes. When people feel they can count on the police to enhance their safety at home, they grant them legitimacy. When the police themselves threaten their safety, they withdraw that legitimacy.\" A 2016 study from the Pew Research Center seems to back up Alexander's message. It found that black people were half as likely as white people to think that their local police were doing a good job when it comes to using force, treating different racial and ethnic groups equally and holding officers accountable for misconduct. And overall blacks were less likely than whites to have confidence in their local police. Alexander argues that law enforcement agencies need to do three things to stop regular wellness checks from turning into deadly situations. He says police departments must re-evaluate the kind of people they hire, take a hard look at how officers are trained and reassess the kind of leaders picked to supervise the police force. Akkad, the New York mental health teacher, says tragedies like Jefferson's death can compound problems because they further erode the trust that communities have with the police, he said. \"It leaves communities in limbo of letting people die, because they don't know how to reach out to someone for help,\" he said.  It all comes down to training Police departments across the nation have made attempts over the years to improve their training, diversify their ranks and educate law enforcement officers about minorities and their histories.  Police in Washington, DC, last year added a nearly 10-hour training program that includes a trip to the National Museum of African American History and Culture so that officers can learn about the historical interactions between law enforcement and minority communities. Similar training programs have been established in Chicago, Philadelphia and by policing agencies and academies in California.  But the best training isn't good enough when law enforcement agencies hire the wrong kind of people, said Maria Haberfeld, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \"It has to start with proper recruitment and selection, and for this departments need to make transformational changes,\" Haberfeld told CNN. \"Assess the potential candidates based on their emotional maturity rather than how many push-ups they can do in a minute.\" Agencies need to start recruitment at an older and more mature age, said Haberfeld, who added that training for recruits should include components of emotional intelligence and more realistic scenarios. \"It's there but just not enough,\" she said. \"It's like teaching algebra with offering the students just the most basic equation.  \"Police training is a complex and complicated subject that needs to be delivered by academic experts together with practitioners -- at the same time,\" she added. \"Only this will generate the desired results.\"", "sourceId": "article_D40457BB-5BFF-2BC1-BA4B-CF94CF7FF270", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/19/us/wellness-check-police-shootings-trnd/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-10-19T11:33:06Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-10-19T11:33:06Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-10-19T12:03:55Z", "path": "/2019/10/19/us/wellness-check-police-shootings-trnd", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Doug Criss and Leah Asmelash, CNN", "contributors": ["Doug Criss"], "headline": "When a police wellness check becomes a death sentence", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191016122131-20191016-police-welfare-check-gfx-story-body.jpg", "tickers": []}, {"_id": "h_bc6f23d6deca80c095cd81e2ee9ffcb0", "type": "article", "body": "Some 300,000 Chicago schoolchildren are out of class for the second day in a row Friday, as negotiations continue between the city and thousands of striking educators. A senior city official told CNN on Thursday the two sides are \"still pretty far apart\" and the strike probably will go through the weekend.  \"We understand that's hard for parents,\" Jesse Sharkey, president of the Chicago Teachers Union, told reporters Friday morning. \"But it's a short-term disruption for what we hope is a long-term commitment to educational justice in this city.\" Bargaining team members spent at least 10 hours at the table on Thursday, according to union Chief of Staff Jennifer Johnson.  \"It was moving, but not nearly enough,\" she said in a news conference Thursday night. About 25,000 educators went on strike with many of the same demands that teachers across the country have clamored for: smaller class sizes, higher raises and more money for schools.   Among the educators is Willie Cousins, who has worked as a teacher's assistant for five years for less than $30,000 a year, he said.  \"And to make ends meet, I've had to pick up an extra job at Walmart, Food 4 Less \u2014 it all depends \u2014 because of my salary,\" he said. \"But I have a family of four that I have to provide for.\"  The union has emphasized its demand for more support staff. They want a librarian and a nurse in every school.  Dennis Kosuth, a CPS nurse, told CNN affiliate WLS that last year, he had to split his time between six schools.  \"It was impossible for me to give the kind of care that I wanted to give to my students,\" he said, adding that this year he only has three. \"But I'm still just as busy.\" \"To me, there just tragedies waiting to happen because we don't have enough staff in our schools,\" Kosuth said. City's offer is the 'best deal,' mayor says \"The ball is very much in their court,\" said Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Friday, after spending part of the morning serving breakfast to students out of class.  \"We need to be at the table every single day, seven days a week, at least 10 hours a day, until we get a deal done,\" she said. Chicago's Board of Education previously released a 71-page counteroffer to the union's demands. It would provide employees with a 16% raise over five years, and $400,000 would be earmarked \"toward a pipeline for nurses, counselors and case managers,\" Lightfoot has said.  The offer includes an additional $1 million to reduce class sizes from grades 4 through 12, and having a \"school community rep\" at every school with a significant homeless population.  Lightfoot previously called the deal \"the best in the Chicago Teachers Union's history.\"  Sharkey had criticized the mayor Friday morning for saying that there was no more money in the budget, saying she was \"stonewalling.\"  \"The fact is there is no more money,\" Lightfoot said in response to Sharkey's comment. \"Period.\"  'It's time for CPS to care, too'   Teachers and their supporters gathered outside City Hall Friday afternoon for a rally to express solidarity with each other and discuss their hopes and demands.  \"Every single one of us is out here because we love our students. We are invested in our community. We have kids in these schools. We care what is going on in these schools,\" said Karen Soto, an elementary school teacher and member of CTU's executive board. \"It's time for CPS to care, too.\"  Linda Perales, a bilingual special education teacher at an elementary school, said she was striking because she and others are \"mourning the loss of bilingual education services in our schools.\" The CPS students who are English language learners \u2014 nearly 20% of the student population \u2014 are not getting the support and services they need, she said.  Bilingual teachers who could work with those students are sometimes pulled for another duty, and their students are left with teachers who don't speak their language and with material they don't understand, Perales said. \"How would you feel if that was happening to you?\" she asked the crowd outside City Hall. \"How would you feel if you were in a space where you had no idea what was being said, what was being read, and what was being written? That is devastating and that should not be happening to our students.\" The teachers have garnered national support, picking up endorsements from Democratic presidential candidates, including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.  Schools and community centers are open to students Lightfoot said her primary concern was ensuring that students had a place to go during the strike and that those who relied on school for breakfast and lunch were still getting fed.  School buildings will remain open throughout the strike to give students a place to go and access to meals, Superintendent Janice Jackson said. The schools are staffed by administrators and employees who aren't part of the union.  School buses won't be running, and students aren't required to go to school. Dozens of community centers are open to students, including YMCAs and Boys & Girls Clubs of Chicago.   Some parents, like Liam Boyd, do not support the strike. The father of a fourth-grader at Blaine Elementary called the strike \"a whole distraction and interruption to the school year.\"  \"I don't support the union,\" he said. \"The school district and the city has been more fair this time and (are) trying to be more fair.\"", "sourceId": "article_0F0F9D19-987F-2C2B-63D5-DEC41A4A7A65", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/18/us/chicago-teacher-strike-friday/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-10-18T13:37:32Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-10-18T22:41:26Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-10-20T12:00:18Z", "path": "/2019/10/18/us/chicago-teacher-strike-friday", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Dakin Andone and Holly Yan, CNN", "contributors": ["Dakin Andone"], "headline": "Chicago teachers' strike stretches into second day as negotiations continue", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191017094528-chicago-teachers-strike-dle-story-body.jpg", "tags": [{"id": "6be79b84-15a1-481e-ad71-0ba4095d4098"}, {"id": "0156f51c-0c01-5ad6-935b-852c861d6c2a"}, {"id": "e4fcd038-b942-42d8-83ca-196f124ca67e"}, {"id": "79c31015-bca0-413f-8b75-783b39c01385"}, {"id": "2d5f25ff-9355-42a5-be9e-7960f6e4f0a3"}, {"id": "bbeba556-f98f-4db4-bbee-d73b417eb1c3"}, {"id": "d9b43c6f-10a3-5a77-a838-dee965420266"}, {"id": "c2112b82-f72d-4669-a596-28400c3baf70"}, {"id": "d5ff3ee3-e522-44c4-b4d4-cd14a7dbd9c3"}, {"id": "9422d6d3-cc0a-546c-89c2-70956c63a005"}, {"id": "bdabe93f-fa19-41bc-aeb5-626f9d872771"}, {"id": "29c0fd4d-43e9-4974-98cd-d6055d9c00a3"}, {"id": "115951ba-4aeb-5d06-915e-56455e691dc3"}, {"id": "115951ba-4aeb-5d06-915e-56455e691dc3"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "2a1fbdb6-333a-4b46-9ec8-29ca034d21ad"}, {"id": "28d880a2-7751-4914-8fc2-ea71eb30debc"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "5aa9e10b-1672-47d0-b9ad-68fb99bf3608"}, {"id": "3c4b8156-ac6f-48c2-90c8-bc18e0e184b9"}, {"id": "85186acd-6f35-432b-9fd7-5586c122151d"}, {"id": "ba65a338-c7ea-48df-a75f-f66b59576260"}, {"id": "15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158"}, {"id": "7bacc4f5-0758-4abd-a57e-c3633bd0f1aa"}, {"id": "62c4ff95-90a9-4189-a4fa-22b6163fe996"}, {"id": "8082a23f-9318-4c6e-b3c7-5f11aa967d87"}, {"id": "b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c"}, {"id": "ba149945-03c8-4584-83c3-13dd4e4b89cd"}, {"id": "c8456516-b9be-42bc-ac2f-c96364001bee"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "d8b0ad8e-a3f0-4e4e-90ab-9fa21e0144ce"}, {"id": "5a28e968-c756-5767-9284-e39252a0517d"}, {"id": "a9ab55ba-2f08-44bc-a81a-6e7f0f11e036"}, {"id": "0a43ce3b-5bb4-4de4-b58e-f924fe64b3a1"}, {"id": "9b9aed9f-e3a5-479a-81e5-600f0b0cb607"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "tickers": []}, {"_id": "h_c4b49047ab15495db10c13cda21b6f8a", "type": "article", "sourceId": "article_30E3D258-6FF7-873B-919B-F49644D7CFD5", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/26/us/2016-presidential-campaign-hacking-fast-facts/index.html", "path": "/2016/12/26/us/2016-presidential-campaign-hacking-fast-facts", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "CNN Library", "contributors": [], "firstPublishDate": "2016-12-27T00:50:55Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-10-18T21:16:25Z", "headline": "2016 Presidential Campaign Hacking Fast Facts", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "body": "Here's a look at hacking incidents during the 2016 presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. For details about investigations into hacking and efforts to interfere with the election, see 2016 Presidential Election Investigation Fast Facts.   Timeline:\nSeptember 2015 - The FBI contacts the Democratic National Committee's help desk, cautioning the IT department that at least one computer has been compromised by Russian hackers. A technician scans the system and does not find anything suspicious.  November 2015 - The FBI reaches out to the DNC again, warning them that one of their computers is transmitting information back to Russia. DNC management later says that IT technicians failed to pass along the message that the system had been breached.   March 19, 2016 - Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta receives a phishing email masked as an alert from Google that another user had tried to access his account. It contains a link to a page where Podesta can change his password. He shares the email with a staffer from the campaign's help desk. The staffer replies with a typo - instead of typing \"This is an illegitimate email,\" the staffer types \"This is a legitimate email.\" Podesta follows the instructions and types a new password, allowing hackers to access his emails.  April 2016 - Hackers create a fake email account and use it to send spear-phishing emails to more than thirty Clinton staffers, according to investigators. In the emails, the hackers embed a link purporting to direct the recipient to a document titled \"hillaryclinton-favorable-rating.xlsx.\" The link directs the recipients' computers to a website operated by the hackers. That same month, hackers use stolen credentials to access the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee computer network, stealing data with malware. They ultimately access 33 DNC computers and anonymously register a website called DC Leaks to publicize the release of documents.  May-June 2016 - The hackers steal thousands of emails from the DNC server and begin to conceal their efforts.  June 12, 2016 - During an interview on British television, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange says that the website has obtained and will publish a batch of campaign emails. June 14, 2016 - The Washington Post reports hackers working for the Russian government accessed the DNC's computer system, stealing oppositional research on Trump and viewing staffers' emails and chat exchanges. The Kremlin, however, denies that the government was linked to the hack and a US official tells CNN that investigators have not yet concluded that the cyberattack was directed by the Russian government.  June 15, 2016 -  Crowdstrike, a cybersecurity firm hired by the DNC, posts a public notice on its website describing an attack on the political committee's computer network by two groups associated with Russian intelligence. According to the post, two groups called \"Cozy Bear\" and \"Fancy Bear\" tunneled into the committee's computer system. In response, the hackers create a persona called Guccifer 2.0, a self-described Romanian blogger who claims that he alone conducted the theft. July 22, 2016 - Days before the Democratic National Convention, WikiLeaks publishes nearly 20,000 emails hacked from the DNC server. The documents include notes in which DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz insults staffers from the Bernie Sanders campaign as well as messages that suggest the organization was favoring Clinton rather than remaining neutral. Wasserman Schultz resigns as DNC chair in the aftermath of the leak.    July 25, 2016 - The FBI announces it has launched an investigation into the hack. Officials tell CNN they think the cyberattack is linked to Russia.  July 27, 2016 - During a press conference, Trump talks about Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and calls on hackers to find deleted emails. \"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\" says Trump. Newt Gingrich, a Trump surrogate, defends Trump in a Tweet, dismissing the comment as a \"joke.\"   August 12, 2016 - Hackers publish cell phone numbers and personal email addresses for Nancy Pelosi and members of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. September 1, 2016 - During an interview with Bloomberg News, Russian President Vladimir Putin says that he and the Russian government have no ties to the hackers. He says that the identity of the culprit or culprits is not as important as the content of the leaks and ultimately the hackers have revealed important information for voters.   September 22, 2016 - Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Adam Schiff, ranking members of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, issue a joint statement declaring that based on information they received during congressional briefings, they believe Russian intelligence agencies are carrying out a plan to interfere with the election. They call on Putin to order a halt to the activities. September 26, 2016 - During a presidential debate, Trump questions whether the DNC cyberattack was carried out by a state-sponsored group or a lone hacker. \"It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\"  October-November 2016 - Over the course of a month, WikiLeaks publishes more than 58,000 messages hacked from Podesta's account.  October 6, 2016 - DC Leaks publishes a batch of documents stolen from Clinton ally Capricia Marshall.  October 7, 2016 - The Department of Homeland Security and the Office of National Intelligence on Election Security issue a statement declaring that the intelligence community is \"confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from US persons and institutions.\" According to the statement, document releases on websites WikiLeaks and DCLeaks mirror the methods and motivations of past Russian-directed cyberattacks.  November 29, 2016 - Democratic senators send a letter to President Barack Obama calling on intelligence agencies to declassify information about \"the Russian Government and the US election.\" Sources later tell CNN that new intelligence has been shared with lawmakers suggesting that Russia's purpose for meddling in the election was to sway voters towards Trump, rather than broadly undermining confidence in the system.    December 9, 2016 - The Washington Post reports the CIA has determined that Russian hacking was conducted to boost Trump and hurt Clinton. The Trump transition team dismisses the report and criticizes the CIA. Obama asks intelligence agencies to review the hacking incidents and other cyberattacks on political campaigns dating back to 2008. The agencies are asked to deliver their findings before Obama leaves office on January 20. A Russian foreign ministry spokesman expresses skepticism about the review and asks US investigators to share their evidence of government-sponsored cyber espionage.  December 10, 2016 - John McCain, Chuck Schumer, Lindsey Graham and Jack Reed issue a joint statement calling on Congress to work on securing future elections and stopping cyberattacks.  December 11, 2016 - Sources tell CNN that although US intelligence agencies share the belief that Russia played a role in the computer hacks, there is disagreement between the CIA and the FBI about the intent of the meddling. While the CIA assessment shows that the Russians may have sought to damage Clinton and help Trump, the FBI has yet to find proof that the attacks were orchestrated to elect the Republican candidate, according to unnamed officials. Furthermore, some sources say the hackers also infiltrated the Republican National Committee's computers.   December 12, 2016 - CNN reports that Russian hackers accessed computer accounts of Republican lawmakers and GOP organizations. A source with knowledge of the investigation says that even though hackers breached the GOP computers, they opted not to release documents. December 13, 2016 - The New York Times publishes a detailed account of the DNC's delayed response to initial warnings in September of 2015 that its network had been infiltrated by hackers. The report outlines how phishing emails and communication failures led to a sweeping cyberattack. The story also lays out evidence that Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks were linked to Russia. A second article in the Times chronicles the hacking of the DCCC. According to the report, Guccifer 2.0 stole tens of thousands of documents and offered them to reporters in districts where Democratic candidates were engaged in competitive races for House seats.   December 29, 2016 - Obama issues an executive order with sanctions against Russia. The order names six Russian individuals who allegedly took part in the hacking. Additionally, 35 Russian diplomats are ordered to leave the US within 72 hours.  January 3, 2017 - Assange says that the Russian government did not provide him with the hacked DNC emails during an interview with Sean Hannity on the Fox News Channel.    January 3-4, 2017 - In a series of tweets, Trump questions the US intelligence community's claims that the Russian government interfered with the election. He alleges that intelligence officials have delayed a scheduled meeting with him but sources tell CNN that there has been no change to the schedule. Trump also cites Assange's interview to back his assertion that a rogue hacker, not the Russian government, may have meddled in the election.   January 5-6, 2017 - Intelligence officials meet separately with Obama and Trump to present the results of their probe into cyber espionage during the presidential campaign. After the president and the president-elect are briefed, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence releases a declassified version of its classified report on Russian meddling. According to the report, hackers did not breach voting machines or computers that tallied election results but Russians meddled in other ways. Putin ordered a multifaceted influence campaign that included spreading pro-Trump propaganda online and hacking the DNC and Podesta, according to the report. Bracing for a possible Clinton win, Russian bloggers were prepared to promote a hashtag #DemocracyRIP on election night. Paid social media users shared stories about Clinton controversies to create a cloud of scandal around her campaign. January 6-7, 2017 - Trump issues a statement after his meeting with intelligence officials. In the statement, he acknowledges that the Russian government may have been linked to the DNC hacking but declares that cyberattacks did not impact the outcome of the election because voting machines were not breached. In a series of tweets, he repeats that hacking did not affect election results and says that he wants to improve relations with Russia.

Sam Smith took to Instagram in September to announce that their pronouns are they/them. Merriam-Webster announced a few days later that \"they\" can also be used to refer to a single person whose gender identity is non-binary, meaning neither male or female. And recently, Sen. Kamala Harris introduced herself at a CNN LGBTQ Town Hall by stating that her pronouns are \"she, her and hers.\" Maybe all this is new to you. Maybe you're a little confused. Maybe you've been doing this for a while, but you know a friend, coworker or family member who could use some help. Whatever the case, we've got you covered. CNN talked to Shige Sakurai, the founder of International Pronouns Day and the associate director of the LGBT Equity Center at the University of Maryland, College Park, about why it matters what pronouns you use to refer to people and what to do if you slip up. What do we mean by pronouns exactly? Time for a quick grammar refresher. Personal pronouns are the words used in place of specific people, places or things. Pronouns like \"me, myself and I\" are how people talk about themselves, and pronouns like \"you, she, he and they\" are some pronouns that people use to talk about others. A person's pronouns are the third-person singular pronouns that they would like others to use for them. Personal pronouns are used to convey a person's gender identity and don't necessarily align with the sex a person was assigned at birth. The most common third-person singular pronouns are \"she/her/hers\" and \"he/him/his.\" \"They/them\" can also be used to refer to a single person, while some people use gender-neutral or gender-inclusive pronouns like \"ze/hir\" (pronounced zee/here) instead. Some people might not use pronouns at all and go only by a name. Why does it matter what pronouns you use to refer to someone? Using the pronouns that a person goes by is a way of respecting that person's gender identity -- or a person's emotional and psychological sense of their own gender.  If someone tells you that they go by the pronouns \"they/them,\" for example, and you continue to refer to them using \"he/him/his\" pronouns, it can imply that you believe that transgender, non-binary or intersex people are unimportant, or shouldn't exist. Intentionally calling someone by the wrong pronoun can make them feel disrespected or alienated, and can take a toll on their mental health. It is also offensive and can be considered harassment.  Sometimes people can use the wrong pronoun for others without realizing it or meaning any harm. People who aren't used to thinking about what pronouns others use to refer to themselves might make assumptions about someone else's pronouns based on their name or appearance. But those assumptions can be incorrect and similarly hurtful because they imply a person has to look a certain way to demonstrate their gender identity. Isn't using 'they/them' to refer to one person grammatically incorrect? You might have learned in English class that \"they\" and \"them\" describe a group of people, while \"he\" and \"she\" describe a single person. But language is constantly evolving, and you need look no further than the foremost authorities on language: dictionaries. Merriam-Webster recently added a new definition in its entry for \"they,\" noting that the pronoun is also used to refer to an individual whose gender identity is non-binary.  Using \"they\" to refer to one person isn't just a new thing or a case of political correctness. Sakurai, who uses \"they/them\" pronouns, says they have been in spaces where this has been a practice for decades. \"It might be something that people are now becoming more aware of in more mainstream, broader spaces, but it's not something that's a new conversation for trans people or even for some people in the LGBT community sometimes,\" Sakurai said. In fact, people have been using \"they\" as a singular pronoun as far back as the 14th century. The Oxford English Dictionary traces singular \"they\" all the way back to 1375 where it appeared in a medieval romance, writes Dennis Baron, a professor of English and linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It's likely that singular \"they\" was used even earlier, given that words often exist in speech before they are written down. Baron also notes that \"you\" was originally a plural pronoun, with its singular being \"thou, thee and thy.\" Now we've happily accepted \"you\" as a pronoun to refer to a single person. I want to be respectful, but I'm not sure where to start Often, someone will outright tell you what pronouns they'd like for you to call them. If so, respect that. If a person hasn't shared their pronouns and there's any doubt as to what they are, don't just guess. Instead, Sakurai suggests continuing to refer to that person by their name until you get more clarity.  Sakurai also recommends sharing your own pronouns first, which creates an invitation for others to do the same. Asking a person directly about their pronouns is also an option, but be mindful of the context and environment that you're in. Is it in front of a large group of people where that person could feel singled out? Is the setting friendly to transgender and non-binary people? If you think the question could make someone feel singled out, it might be worth having a more private conversation. Some people might not be \"out\" as transgender or non-binary in certain settings and might therefore be reluctant to share. Others might be transitioning or coming to terms with their gender identity and the question could bring up painful feelings for them. Use your best judgment. Talking about pronouns feels awkward Sure, it might feel a little uncomfortable at first, especially if you're not used to thinking about gender identity as distinct from a person's biological sex. Ultimately though, normalizing the practice of sharing or asking about pronouns helps build a more supportive and inclusive environment for intersex, transgender and non-binary people. It lets those folks know that you see them and respect who they are. Some easy ways to start doing this include incorporating your pronouns in your email signature or adding them to your bio on social media profiles.  And at the end of the day, sharing your own pronouns or asking for someone else's is not nearly as awkward as making an incorrect assumption.  What should I do if I slip up? If you realize in the moment that you've mistakenly referred to someone using the wrong pronoun, the best thing to do is quickly correct yourself and move on. You can say something like, \"Sorry, I meant they.\" If you realize that you've made a mistake after a conversation has ended, apologize privately and move on. Don't apologize over and over again or keep telling that person how badly you feel about your mistake, Sakurai says. Doing so can make the person who was misgendered feel uncomfortable or responsible for comforting you, which isn't their job. If the person who you misgendered gets upset, try to put yourself in their shoes. Aside from feeling like their identity has been denied, it's possible that this person has experienced many similar instances and this one mistake finally pushed them to a breaking point, Sakurai says.  Keep in mind that their reaction might not necessarily be about you, but about the harm they've experienced by repeatedly being referred to incorrectly.

It's not a word you can say on an airplane (cue Ben Stiller). You also have to be careful when using it to describe a storm system. You hear the phrase \"bomb cyclone\" popping up off and on in weather stories. Here's what it means:  What makes a storm a bomb cyclone?  \u2022 Bomb cyclone is a term given to a rapidly strengthening storm that fulfills one important criterion.  \u2022 Generally, pressure must drop 24 millibars (a unit of pressure) within 24 hours. \u2022 However, that benchmark is also based on the latitude of the storm. So, the millibar requirement can change depending on where the storm forms.   But why's it called that? The term bomb cyclone can be traced back to a meteorological research paper published in a 1980 edition of Monthly Weather Review. Its authors, MIT meteorologists Fred Sanders and John Gyakum, built upon work by Swedish meteorology researcher Tor Bergeron, who had initially defined \"rapidly deepening\" storms as those that met the 24 millibars-in-24 hours criterion.  But Bergeron was way up in Scandinavia, where storms strengthen much quicker because of the latitude (remember the Coriolis effect?). Sanders and Gyakum adjusted the ground rules to vary based on latitude. And they added the term \"bomb\" because of the explosive power that these storms derive from rapid pressure drops (though Gyakum reportedly doesn't use that word anymore because of its reference to weaponry). How do you adjust the rules? Since you read down this far, I feel obligated to give you the actual equation (and if you love it, perhaps you should consider pursuing a career in meteorology!). To calculate the pressure drop needed for a bomb cyclone, you take the sine of the latitude where the low pressure is located and divide it by the sine of 60 degrees (and you thought you would never use trigonometry).  Why 60 degrees? That's the latitude where Bergeron was when he developed the initial scale.

Democratic debate Elizabeth Warren is the new front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, so she took on all of the attacks from her rivals during last's night debate. The moderates on stage really got after her, especially Pete Buttigieg, who pressed her on how she would pay for her\u00a0Medicare for All plans and what it would mean for private insurance. He also ripped her for not answering a yes-or-no question on raising taxes on the middle class. Warren pushed back on all of them, saying Democrats can only win next year if they \"dream big and fight hard,\" and not \"quit before we get started.\" Joe Biden largely stayed out of the fray for most of the debate, though he and Bernie Sanders did get into a progressive vs. moderate tussle near the end that's pretty typical of this election cycle. Speaking of Sanders, he made the biggest news of the night, not for what happened on stage but for the endorsement he's going to pick up from\u00a0New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other members of \"The Squad.\" Here is\u00a0CNN's Chris Cillizza's take on who won and who lost last night in Ohio. Here are seven takeaways from the night and an all-important fact check. Click here to see the best pics from the debate and to find out who talked the most. And if you missed last night's action, watch the full Democratic debate here. 2. Syria Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he's not worried about US sanctions and won't heed US demands for a ceasefire as Turkey's military offensive into northern Syria continues. Erdogan's comments come as Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo led a delegation to Turkey to try to negotiate a deal to end the miliary operation. Meanwhile, Russian military police units are on patrol in northern Syria, keeping Turkish troops away from Syrian forces and their new Kurdish allies. As Russia flexes its muscle in the Middle East, Russian President Vladimir Putin is on something of a victory lap in the region, CNN's Matthew Chance writes. What doesn't need to be lost in all of this is the severe toll all this chaos is taking on civilians in northern Syria. Dozens of people have already been killed in the fighting, and hundreds of thousands are trying to escape the violence as colder weather sets in. Here's how you can help refugees in Syria. 3. Impeachment inquiry There won't be a vote on the\u00a0impeachment inquiry, at least for now. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced her decision after meeting with Democratic lawmakers yesterday. President Trump and his allies have said that without a formal vote the entire impeachment inquiry is illegitimate, but Pelosi and the Dems say there's nothing in the Constitution that requires that. Meanwhile, Rudy Giuliani said he won't comply with a subpoena issued to him for documents related to Ukraine. Click here to read the latest on the impeachment inquiry. 4. Fort Worth shooting Aaron Dean --\u00a0the former Forth Worth, Texas, police officer who shot and killed Atatiana Jefferson during a welfare check -- isn't cooperating in the investigation. Dean has refused to be interviewed by detectives and declined to provide a written statement. New details about the shooting were revealed yesterday as Dean's arrest warrant was released. Jefferson's nephew, with whom she was playing video games\u00a0when she was shot, told investigators his aunt pulled out her handgun from her purse when she heard noises outside. She was pointing the gun at the window when she was shot by Dean, who was in Jefferson's backyard and had not announced that he was a police officer.\u00a0Interim Police Chief Ed Kraus, who apologized for the shooting, said it made sense that she would have a gun if she felt threatened. 5. Weather Last week, a nor'easter ripped up New England beaches. Another storm is forming this week, and it could be a lot worse. Forecasters think this latest nor'easter could strengthen so rapidly it could turn into a \"bomb cyclone,\"\u00a0which generally is marked by a pressure drop of 24 millibars (a unit of pressure) within 24 hours. This storm is also expected to stay onshore more than last week's storm. So folks from New York City up to Portland, Maine, can expect\u00a0tropical storm-force winds and up to 3 inches of rain from now through the end of the week. Meanwhile, in Japan,\u00a0the death toll from Typhoon Hagibis climbed to 74. BREAKFAST BROWSE People are talking about these. Read up. Join in. A whole new world Or at least a whole new island.

The comments from Cherokee and Creek chiefs come after the Atlanta Braves said the team would hold a \"continued dialogue\" with Native Americans during the Major League Baseball offseason about whether to keep the decades-old tradition.  The Braves did not specify which tribal nations it planned to talk to. \"Although the Tomahawk Chop may be a game day tradition, it is not an appropriate acknowledgment of tribal tradition or culture,\" Muscogee (Creek) Nation Principal Chief James R. Floyd said in a statement to CNN. \"It reduces Native Americans to a caricature and minimizes the contributions of Native peoples as equal citizens and human beings.\" The tomahawk chop involves fans moving their forearms forward and backward with an open palm in a chopping motion and is usually accompanied by chants. The motion started at Florida State University but was adopted by the Braves in 1991 following the signing of former FSU three-sport star Deion Sanders. It's now widely associated with the Braves, who often leave foam tomahawks for fans on seats during home games. The tomahawk chop has long raised objections about the way it depicts Native Americans. Earlier this month, that debate was reignited when St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley criticized the tomahawk after Game 2 of the National League Division Series. \"I think it's a misrepresentation of the Cherokee people or Native Americans in general,\" Helsley, who is a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"It's not me being offended by the whole mascot thing. It's not. It's about the misconception of us, the Native Americans, and it devalues us and how we're perceived in that way, or used as mascots.\" \"That's the disappointing part. That stuff like this still goes on. It's just disrespectful, I think,\" he added. Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. praised Helsley. \"The Cherokee Nation is proud of tribal citizen and Cardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley for speaking out against stereotypes and standing up for the dignity of Native Americans in this country,\" he said in a statement to CNN. \"Hopefully Ryan's actions will better inform the national conversation about inappropriate depictions of Native Americans.\" The Braves announced before Game 5 of the NLDS that it would \"reduce\" the use of the tomahawk chop by not distributing the foam souvenirs on seats and not playing the accompanying music or using chop-related graphics when Helsley was in the game. But those changes were only for Game 5, which marked the end of the postseason for the Braves after a 13-1 loss to the Cardinals. It remains to be seen whether the team will eliminate the controversial tradition.  Beth Marshall, a representative for the Braves, referred CNN to an earlier statement, and said that she would provide an update when there is more information available. \"We appreciate and take seriously the concerns of Mr. Helsley and have worked to honor and respect the Native American community through the years. Our organization has sought to embrace all people and highlight the many cultures in Braves Country,\" the Braves statement said. \"We will continue to evaluate how we activate elements of our brand, as well as the in-game experience, and look forward to a continued dialogue with those in the Native American community once the season comes to an end.\"", "sourceId": "article_D62AF9BA-057D-049A-39A6-CACE55E09565", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/15/us/atlanta-braves-tomahawk-tribes-inappropriate-trnd/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-10-15T22:33:26Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-10-15T22:45:11Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-10-15T22:45:11Z", "path": "/2019/10/15/us/atlanta-braves-tomahawk-tribes-inappropriate-trnd", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Harmeet Kaur, CNN", "contributors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "headline": "Once again, chiefs of tribal nations say the Atlanta Braves' tomahawk chop is inappropriate", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191009181645-01-braves-tomahawk-story-body.jpg", "tags": [{"id": "51a3aa56-5272-5316-8668-deccb4001f39"}, {"id": "04756aaf-afb7-543e-a8a7-d6f96f780174"}, {"id": "37a5568e-2a8b-4c4c-b646-b778b49df6c0"}, {"id": "c921b291-efc3-4a7f-9346-44e06fdf8d58"}, {"id": "90afd1f1-5892-5576-a480-a05927a83301"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "49b3767f-e5b3-40be-aee2-f6c1d7c9fe7c"}, {"id": "de9f126b-0ff6-4737-b26c-b9f3f0a62a9b"}, {"id": "9626774b-4aba-5f47-9902-762f595939cc"}, {"id": "54df48e1-7659-57bd-b6e4-dcbf5498acfd"}, {"id": "3001960f-c393-56aa-bb07-ca23e0facb1d"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "9458a483-8643-4b0a-abcf-aebd1c51cf12"}, {"id": "2e564859-3208-572a-b619-f46393ea0891"}, {"id": "9c5826c0-329c-54ce-b065-3826ae02b3ab"}, {"id": "2db6356f-830e-5f8e-9eb4-7694e3faf9e9"}, {"id": "9b9aed9f-e3a5-479a-81e5-600f0b0cb607"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "tickers": []}, {"_id": "h_d1d23db875b3e3d2c0b190443f34c76a", "type": "article", "body": "The University of Nevada, Las Vegas is investigating a threatening note targeting the community, African Americans and local supporters of Bernie Sanders, officials said.

Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Syria  The ongoing attacks by Turkish forces on the Syrian border are causing some serious global fears to be realized, including a possible resurgence of ISIS. Yesterday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said President Trump is ordering the remaining US forces out of northern Syria, a move that many fear will paralyze counter-terrorism efforts in the area. Kurdish forces have been instrumental in quelling the regional rise of ISIS, but because of the ongoing conflict, that line of defense is diminishing. This weekend, Kurdish authorities reported the escape of hundreds of people with links to ISIS from a detention camp in the area. The attacks are affecting Syrian Kurds, an ethnic minority group with a history of assisting the US in regional conflicts. Several leaders within the US have voiced their outrage and concern that the US' apparent disregard for these established allies could diminish the US' international reputation.    2. Trump video A disturbing video of a fake President Donald Trump shooting, assaulting and stabbing his critics and the media was played at a conference held by a pro-Trump group at his Miami resort last week, according to footage obtained by The New York Times. The video was played at Trump's National Doral Miami during an American Priority conference, and contained several internet memes including an image of Donald Trump's head superimposed on the body of someone shooting up the \"Church of Fake News. The \"church\" was depicted as a series of Trump critics and news organizations. The video also featured a Trump 2020 reelected logo. A spokesman for Trump's campaign claims he didn't see the video, but said the campaign does not condone violence. The event's organizer says the matter is under review. Several media organizations, including CNN and The White House Correspondents' Association, have called on the President to personally denounce the video.    3. Fort Worth shooting  A black woman was shot and killed in her own home by a police officer this weekend, and the community wants answers. Atatiana Koquice Jefferson, 28, was killed Saturday morning after a neighbor called a non-emergency number to report the woman's front door was open. The officers were searching near the perimeter of Jefferson's home when they saw a person standing inside near a window and one of them opened fire, killing her. The incident has ignited a new flare of pain and outrage regarding the ongoing problem of police killings of black individuals. The Fort Worth Police Department released heavily-edited body cam footage a few hours after the incident, and the officer who shot Jefferson will be interviewed by the FWPD's Major Case Unit today. However, neighbors and activists have called for an independent investigation, saying the unit shouldn't be investigating the actions of their own officers.    4. Typhoon Hagibis Typhoon Hagibis swept over central Japan this weekend, leaving at least 31 people dead and 186 others injured in its wake. The typhoon became the longest-lived super typhoon of 2019 last week before it made landfall, but weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday. Evacuation advisories affected tens of million of people and hundreds of thousands are still without power following its impact. To make matters more complicated, the country is hosting the World Rugby Championships. Several matches had to be preemptively canceled because of the storm. However, a pivotal match between Japan and Scotland did go ahead, with the host nation prevailing to claim a quarterfinal spot. It was a much-needed bright moment before the long, grim period of recovery sets in.    5. Impeachment  Strap in for another roller coaster ride of impeachment proceedings as lawmakers return to Capitol Hill this week. Today, the President's former top Russia adviser Fiona Hill is expected to be interviewed by three House panels as part of the Democrats' impeachment probe. Top Trump administration officials, including the vice president and Energy Department secretary, also face deadlines this week to turn over documents related to the Ukraine investigation. Meanwhile, President Trump threatened this weekend to sue Rep. Adam Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over his impeachment predicament. He also suggested offhand that he might impeach them. (Constitutionally speaking, members of Congress cannot be impeached.) THIS JUST IN... Nobel Prize winner The Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer for their work in finding ways to alleviate global poverty. BREAKFAST BROWSE People are talking about these. Read up. Join in. It was an amazing weekend for women in sports  Simone Biles, Coco Gauff and Brigid Kosgei smashed records in gymnastics, tennis and marathon running, respectively. What did YOU do this weekend?  'Saturday Night Live' slays with 'Joker' parody featuring gritty 'Sesame Street' parody  It's disturbing how easily that theme song can sound like a horror soundtrack.  Fortnite has been down for hours and people are wondering if it's a stunt, a planned outage or something more  So if your nephews and nieces have been grumpy for some reason, this is why. Inside the world of ARMY, the rabid fan base of Korean pop group BTS  They make Beatlemania look like a Tuesday night town council meeting.   HAPPENING LATER A fancy government affair  Today, the UK will observe the ceremonial State Opening of Parliament, which is an event that brings together all of the branches of government as well as the monarchy. There will be pomp, circumstance, carriages, frippery and most importantly, a speech by Queen Elizabeth II herself.    NUMBER OF THE DAY $40 billion Iran says it has discovered a new natural gas reserve with the capacity to produce nearly 400 million barrels of gas condensate. How much money could that vast amount of gas generate? That big, red number right up there.  TODAY'S WEATHER   QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I'm the reason there is impeachment going on.\" Joe Biden, sounding off on the impeachment process during a forum in Iowa on Sunday. In related news, Hunter Biden announced he will be stepping down from his board role in the management company of a private equity fund backed by Chinese state-owned entities and will not work for foreign-owned firms if his father is elected.

The judge made the announcement Friday concerning the fate of Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, who was convicted in the 2014 killings of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.  Haskell was found guilty of capital murder last month. Authorities said he entered the Stays' home on July 9, 2014, demanding to know the whereabouts of his estranged wife, Melannie Haskell. She was not there, but her sister, Katie Stay, and her family were. Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys, ages 13 and 4, and two girls, ages 9 and 7, were killed when Haskell opened fire, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said. Only one member of the family, then 15-year-old Cassidy Stay, survived.  Authorities at the time indicated she was critically wounded, though she later made a full recovery. Haskell was led out of court Friday by a court deputy after a brief witness impact statement was read by Cassidy Stay. She said in part, \"For the past five years I always wanted to know how you felt about me and what kind of remorse you felt?\" When she learned that Haskell apparently didn't express remorse, Cassidy Stay said, \"Only God can help me now.\"", "sourceId": "article_EEA975D6-FDA5-3052-C1AD-BD0F88C7BD06", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/11/us/texas-stay-family-murder-sentence-lethal-injection/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-10-12T00:11:19Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-10-12T00:22:29Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-10-12T00:22:29Z", "path": "/2019/10/11/us/texas-stay-family-murder-sentence-lethal-injection", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Sheena Jones and Leah Asmelash, CNN", "contributors": ["Nicole Chavez", "Sheena Jones"], "headline": "A man found guilty of killing his ex-wife's family in Texas will die by lethal injection", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140714210908-ac-pkg-kaye-texas-massacre-sole-survivor-speaks-00022406-story-body.jpg", "tags": [{"id": "fd529c2d-a4f7-4f7e-b39a-850e8a28c03f"}, {"id": "b21c6c7c-6fe4-4f10-85da-b81821c55578"}, {"id": "3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734"}, {"id": "79e68efe-c60a-4a30-a061-75907457608a"}, {"id": "8b9fea0c-3a01-4650-be27-babb027ee16f"}, {"id": "7f9e3331-436d-4b95-8a53-05c644fe2597"}, {"id": "8d7177ef-0a7e-44b5-9a58-6c98c0968023"}, {"id": "86f1d6f8-6a48-4e2c-8c1c-d3a9cbc794c2"}, {"id": "bbeba556-f98f-4db4-bbee-d73b417eb1c3"}, {"id": "5650d962-d7f0-5810-89b5-67dd679215a0"}, {"id": "3f9c3ae3-f072-4733-ad97-4748ce5e9bba"}, {"id": "7868d30d-351e-49d6-b43c-cada30480487"}, {"id": "7868d30d-351e-49d6-b43c-cada30480487"}, {"id": "5b36ef16-3401-45d7-b9a3-3366fcd2831d"}, {"id": "b9803964-3ca6-5e9a-82c7-b4a707f99893"}, {"id": "b9803964-3ca6-5e9a-82c7-b4a707f99893"}, {"id": "b9803964-3ca6-5e9a-82c7-b4a707f99893"}, {"id": "9e860613-11b3-4c8c-97d2-441550b4b7f6"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "2a1fbdb6-333a-4b46-9ec8-29ca034d21ad"}, {"id": "28d880a2-7751-4914-8fc2-ea71eb30debc"}, {"id": "c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "b852b5d8-31c6-49e9-8ff1-986a55356fa1"}, {"id": "85186acd-6f35-432b-9fd7-5586c122151d"}, {"id": "5513f688-c810-4746-9612-5d9aa4fab994"}, {"id": "15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158"}, {"id": "7bacc4f5-0758-4abd-a57e-c3633bd0f1aa"}, {"id": "b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c"}, {"id": "ba149945-03c8-4584-83c3-13dd4e4b89cd"}, {"id": "c8456516-b9be-42bc-ac2f-c96364001bee"}, {"id": "aa67276b-8530-439b-914f-1be2979f9bc7"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "5da77f4f-b1c0-4f34-85db-e9e8ec049abe"}, {"id": "58da1feb-6773-40a4-bb2c-2267f06c5689"}, {"id": "9c5826c0-329c-54ce-b065-3826ae02b3ab"}, {"id": "a86a1280-b4cf-444a-a9dd-4722889c8cab"}, {"id": "f0a0d4d0-7cb3-5328-89b8-73721db659bf"}, {"id": "371d0edb-606f-5060-9394-aa93235b9684"}, {"id": "9e77e33a-ec67-5055-bb7a-f945a97882b6"}, {"id": "abe56a8a-e19e-450c-bc9a-1ae16383edb9"}, {"id": "12967d01-3194-4c24-b4a8-91f471860718"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "tickers": []}, {"_id": "h_59abac0002d4227f6bb2c9f344db3268", "type": "article", "body": "National Coming Out Day is here. Friday marks the 31st anniversary of National Coming Out Day, celebrated every year on October 11, the anniversary of the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights. The day is meant to celebrate the act of \"coming out\" -- when an LGBT person decides to publicly share their gender identities or sexual orientation. Though not everyone can safely come out, many people use the day to share their own personal coming out stories, support those who choose to keep their identities a secret or come out themselves. This particular National Coming Out Day comes amidst a troubling time for LGBT folks in the United States. On October 8, the Supreme Court began considering whether the federal employment law -- which prevents discrimination based on sex -- also encompasses discrimination claims based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The Trump administration has said Title VII of the Civil Rights Act does not provide such protections, and the lower courts have split on the issue. But at stake lies the ability of the government to protect the LGBT community -- as the cases could have broader implications for housing and education, not just employment.  Politicians, writers, celebrities and even national governments took to Twitter to express their support Friday. Here are some highlights.  What people said Pete Buttigieg, Democratic presidential nominee hopeful, reflected on how far the US has come on LGBT rights, while also expressing concern for where the country is now. He wrote that teens today \"see a president banning trans service members from the military and attacking gay rights. They see queer-friendly businesses opening but can't forget Pulse. They see hate crimes rising. They see a country where they are still not fully free or safe\u2014unsure if they belong.\" He went on to encourage those who still haven't come out. Writer Saeed Jones, whose new memoir \"How We Fight for Our Lives\" partly deals with his own coming out process, offered encouragement. America's favorite ice skater, Adam Rippon,  told a part of his own story -- making a slight joke in the process. Sara Ramirez, artist and activist, shared resources for those grappling with their identity.

Investigation Fast Facts", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "body": "Here's a look at investigations into Russian meddling during the 2016 presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.  For details about computer hacking during the campaign, visit 2016 Presidential Campaign Hacking Fast Facts.   Special counsel Robert Mueller and multiple congressional committees launched Russia-related investigations in 2017.  Select congressional and federal investigations:\nFBI - In July of 2016, the FBI launched a counterintelligence investigation into possible links between the Russian government and Trump campaign officials.  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence - On January 13, 2017, the committee announced that it was conducting a probe of Russian meddling.  This investigation and others were sparked by a declassified report from the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) that described a multifaceted effort led by Russian President Vladimir Putin to interfere with the election by releasing damaging information about Clinton to help Trump.  The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence - On January 25, 2017, the committee announced that it is investigating Russia's active measures during the presidential campaign as well as the underlying intelligence that led to the DNI's conclusions about Russia's intentions. The committee was led by Devin Nunes (R-CA) and Adam Schiff (D-CA) prior to 2019. (Nunes stepped away from the probe temporarily after the Ethics Committee announced it was looking into allegations he made unauthorized disclosures of classified information. When Nunes stepped away, Mike Conaway (R-TX) took his place. Even though Nunes said that he was formally stepping away from his role leading the investigation, he continued to review classified intelligence on Russia matters and he still had sway issuing subpoenas.)  The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform - On March 22, 2017, the committee requested information about former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn's paid speaking engagements overseas. After Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the committee began looking into the circumstances surrounding the dismissal.  The Senate Judiciary Committee - On May 17, 2017, the committee called on the White House and the FBI to turn over all memos related the president's interactions with Comey. In addition to conducting an oversight investigation of Comey's dismissal, the committee has held hearings on the Foreign Agents Registration Act and attempts to influence the election. The committee also interviewed Donald Trump Jr. and other witnesses behind closed doors. Special Counsel - On May 17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead an investigation into Russian interference and related matters that could result in criminal prosecutions. On March 22, 2019, the Justice Department announced the special counsel's office completed its probe, after 22 months, charges against 37 defendants, seven guilty pleas and one conviction at trial. A redacted version of Mueller's report was released on April 18, 2019.  READ: Tracking the Russia investigations Timeline:\nApril 12, 2015 - Clinton officially launches her presidential campaign. June 16, 2015 - Trump launches his campaign. February 2016 - Flynn, a retired general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), begins advising Trump on foreign policy matters, according to Reuters. Flynn became a prominent critic of the Obama administration after he was ousted from the DIA in 2014.  March 29, 2016 - Paul Manafort, a veteran GOP consultant, joins the Trump campaign as a strategist to help prepare for the Republican National Convention.  April 27, 2016 - Trump delivers his first major foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak is one of the diplomats in the audience. Trump's son-in-law and campaign adviser Jared Kushner later says he shook hands with Kislyak at the event.  May 19, 2016 - Manafort is promoted to chief strategist and campaign chairman.  June 3, 2016 - Trump Jr. receives an email from Rob Goldstone, a music publicist whose clients include Azerbaijani-Russian singer Emin Agalarov. Goldstone tells Trump Jr. that a Russian lawyer, working on behalf of the Kremlin, wants to pass along incriminating information about Clinton. He explains that Russia and its government want to support Trump by providing opposition research on Clinton. Trump Jr. indicates he is interested in seeing the information and suggests arranging a call.  June 7-8, 2016 - Goldstone sends Trump Jr. another email about setting up an in-person meeting with a \"Russian government attorney\" who will be flying from Moscow to New York on June 9, to talk to representatives from the Trump campaign at Trump Tower in New York. Trump loops in Manafort and Kushner.  June 9, 2016 - Manafort, Kushner and Trump Jr. meet with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya. It is unclear what is discussed during the meeting, which was set up as a discussion of Russian-sourced opposition research on Clinton. Trump Jr. later says that Veselnitskaya did not present any valuable information during the meeting. The elder Trump did not participate, according to his legal team.  June 12, 2016 - During an interview on British television, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange says that the website has obtained and will publish a batch of Clinton emails. June 14, 2016 - The Washington Post reports hackers working for the Russian government accessed the DNC's computer system, stealing oppositional research on Trump and viewing staffers' emails and chat exchanges. The Kremlin, however, denies that the government was linked to the hack, and a US official tells CNN that investigators have not yet concluded that the cyberattack was directed by the Russian government. June 15, 2016 - A cybersecurity firm hired by the DNC posts a public notice on its website describing an attack on the political committee's computer network by two groups associated with Russian intelligence. According to the post, two Russian-backed groups called \"Cozy Bear\" and \"Fancy Bear\" tunneled into the committee's computer system. In response, a blogger called Guccifer 2.0 claims that he alone conducted the hack, not the Russians. Furthermore, Guccifer 2.0 claims to have passed along thousands of files to WikiLeaks. Trump offers his own theory on the origins of the attack: suggesting in a statement that the DNC hacked itself to distract from Clinton's email scandal. June 20, 2016 - Trump fires campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who had worked with the team for more than a year. As campaign chairman, Manafort is now the top official overseeing Trump's White House run.  July 22, 2016 - Days before the Democratic National Convention, WikiLeaks publishes nearly 20,000 emails hacked from the DNC server. The documents include notes in which DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz insults staffers from the Bernie Sanders campaign and messages that suggest the organization was favoring Clinton rather than remaining neutral. Wasserman Schultz resigns in the aftermath of the leak. July 25, 2016 - The FBI announces it has launched an investigation into the DNC hack. Although the statement doesn't indicate that the agency has a particular suspect or suspects in mind, US officials tell CNN they think the cyberattack is linked to Russia. July 27, 2016 - During a press conference, Trump talks about Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and calls on hackers to find deleted emails. \"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\" says Trump. On or about that same day, hackers target email accounts used by individuals in Clinton's personal office for the first time, according to an indictment filed in 2018 by the special counsel's office.  August 14, 2016 - The New York Times publishes a report that $12.7 million in illegal cash payments to Manafort were listed in a secret ledger linked to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who resigned amid street protests. Manafort had worked as an adviser to Yanukovych and his associates dating back at least a decade.  August 19, 2016 - Manafort resigns as Trump's campaign chairman.  October-November 2016 - Over the course of a month, WikiLeaks publishes more than 58,000 messages hacked from the account of John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman. October 6, 2016 - DCLeaks, a self-described collective of \"hacktivists\" seeking to expose the influence of special interests on elected officials, publishes a batch of documents stolen from Clinton ally Capricia Marshall. DCLeaks is later identified as a front for Russian military intelligence. October 7, 2016 - The Department of Homeland Security and the Office of National Intelligence on Election Security issue a statement declaring that the intelligence community is \"confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from US persons and institutions.\" According to the statement, document releases on websites WikiLeaks and DC Leaks mirror the methods and motivations of past Russian-directed cyberattacks. December 1, 2016 - Kushner and Flynn meet with Kislyak at Trump Tower. Kushner later describes the encounter as a quick introduction, pushing back on a Washington Post report that the three talked about establishing backchannel communication with the Russians.  December 13, 2016 - Kushner meets Russian banker Sergey Gorkov at Trump Tower. Gorkov is the chairman of Vnesheconombank (VEB), a bank that was sanctioned by the United States after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.   January 6, 2017 - The Office of the Director of National Intelligence releases a declassified version of its classified report on Russian meddling. According to the report, hackers did not breach voting machines or computers that tallied election results but Russians meddled in other ways. Putin ordered a multifaceted influence campaign that included spreading pro-Trump propaganda online and hacking the DNC and Podesta. Bracing for a possible Clinton win, Russian bloggers were prepared to promote a hashtag #DemocracyRIP on election night. Paid social media users, aka \"trolls,\" shared stories about Clinton controversies to create a cloud of scandal around her campaign. January 10, 2017 - CNN reports that intelligence officials briefed Trump on a dossier that contains allegations about his campaign's ties to Russia as well as salacious rumors about him. The author of the dossier is a former British spy who was hired by a research firm that had been funded by both political parties to conduct opposition research on Trump. February 9, 2017 - The Washington Post reports that Flynn discussed sanctions with Kislyak during the presidential transition.

"NYT"}, {"id": "FB"}]}, {"_id": "h_ce83cc7a1111a7941c66182ee6d2c85a", "type": "article", "body": "Passengers on a Norwegian Cruise\u00a0ship were\u00a0hopping mad after severe weather forced the ship to cancel several ports of call and float around the Atlantic for days.\u00a0Oh -- and apparently the ship's bathrooms had serious issues, too. Yeesh.  Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Impeachment inquiry There was a maelstrom of impeachment news\u00a0yesterday, and most of it centered around Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal attorney.\u00a0Two of\u00a0Giuliani's Ukraine contacts were arrested on charges of violating campaign finance laws, and now the feds are looking at Giuliani's financial dealings with the men.\u00a0Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who are powerful Republican donors, allegedly introduced Giuliani to Ukrainian officials who pushed unfounded theories about corruption involving former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. How much of this did Giuliani know or participate in? It's unclear, but if the men are offered a chance to exchange information for leniency in sentencing, they may dish on the attorney's involvement.\u00a0When asked about the revelations yesterday, Trump said he doesn't know\u00a0the men.\u00a0House Democrats also\u00a0issued a subpoena to Energy Secretary Rick Perry for\u00a0documents related to the Trump administration's contacts with Ukraine.\u00a0 Adding to the mess, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's senior adviser resigned yesterday. Pompeo has been under pressure from House Democrats over his\u00a0involvement in the Ukraine controversy.\u00a0 2. Brexit After weeks of Brexit deadlock,\u00a0British and Irish leaders Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar raised hope of a breakthrough when they announced yesterday that they saw a \"pathway\" to a Brexit deal.\u00a0After a face-to-face meeting that was billed as a last chance to map out a deal, the pair issued an unexpectedly upbeat statement that indicated progress could be made. How quickly could all of this get wrapped up? Varadkar says they think it's possible to strike a new deal by the end of the month -- that is, as the ball finally drops on Brexit. The effects of Brexit on the Irish border have been a big sticking point for negotiations. In Varadkar's current plan,\u00a0Northern Ireland would leave the EU customs union on the current Brexit deadline of October 31 along with the rest of the UK. But the region would remain aligned with EU regulations on goods and agriculture. 3. Iranian oil tanker An Iranian oil tanker was hit and damaged by two missiles today, and the tanker company says the missiles were \"possibly\" fired from Saudi soil. (Iranian government officials haven't pinned the attack on anyone at this point.) All of the tanker's crew members are safe. A volley of attacks on Iranian and Saudi oil tankers and production facilities in the region has increased tensions in recent months, with the US standing by to see if and when it should get more involved. This latest attack also caused crude oil prices to jump on Friday morning. \u00a0 4. NBA controversy What's going on between the NBA and China? Earlier this week, all of the NBA's official Chinese partners\u00a0suspended ties with the league after\u00a0Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for\u00a0pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The\u00a0NBA apologized to China and distanced itself from Morey's words, but that caused its own backlash: Fans and\u00a0US politicians have been criticizing the league for seemingly prioritizing profits over free speech and human rights. This has led to some small-scale protests at NBA games, and now, Nike and other big apparel companies could get roped in because of their lucrative ties to both the league and Chinese consumers. In case you didn't know, basketball\u00a0is big business in China. The NBA lists\u00a011 wholly-owned Chinese companies as its official partners in the country, and one analyst estimates the league's presence in China\u00a0contributes 10% of its revenue.\u00a0\u00a0 5. Laquan McDonald A new report regarding\u00a0the\u00a0death\u00a0of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, who was fatally shot by a police officer in Chicago in 2014, reveals what investigators described as an elaborate cover-up by\u00a016 officers and supervisors following McDonald's death.\u00a0The hundreds of investigative documents released with the report accuse\u00a011 officers -- including the one who\u00a0fired the fatal shots -- of making false statements to exaggerate the threat posed by the teen, who was black. According to the documents, four others allegedly failed to ensure their video or audio recording systems were working, and a former lieutenant who led the shooting investigation allegedly destroyed handwritten notes from witness interviews. Jason Van Dyke, the former police officer who killed McDonald, was convicted of second-degree murder in January.\u00a0 THIS JUST IN... This year's Nobel Peace Prize winner is... Ethiopia's peacemaking Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.

The Confederacy had three capital cities at varying points: Montgomery, Alabama; Richmond, Virginia; and Danville, Virginia.  But thanks to the election of Steven Reed on Tuesday in Montgomery, all three cities now have black mayors.  Here's what you need to know about the cities and their mayors. Montgomery, Alabama Also known as the first capital of the Confederacy in the early Civil War period, Montgomery has a complicated history. The city is the birthplace of the civil rights movement, but many of its streets and schools still bear Confederate names. And despite its population being 60% black or African-American, the city -- founded in 1819 -- has never had a black mayor. That changed Tuesday with the election of Steven Reed, a Montgomery County probate judge.  \"Let the record show tonight, above all ... what we can do when we come together in this city and we build around positivity, around opportunity, and all the things that tie us together versus those things that keep us apart,\" Reed told supporters at a rally turned victory party. Richmond, Virginia Richmond was the second capital of the Confederacy, and for the longest period -- from 1861 to 1865.  Unlike Montgomery, Richmond, the capital of Virginia, has had a few black mayors throughout its history.  The city elected its first black mayor, Henry Marsh, in 1977 and has had seven more since then, including current Mayor Levar Stoney. He was sworn in on the last day of 2016, the youngest mayor ever elected in the city. Stoney was named by LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Virginia as one of its \"Outstanding Virginians\" in 2019. Danville, Virginia Danville was the capital for only eight days, after Richmond fell, but it still counts.  Just three years after Richmond elected its first black mayor, Danville followed suit -- electing Charles Harris in 1980. The current mayor is also black: Alonzo Jones, who was elected last year.", "sourceId": "article_AB468098-025E-442C-A4E2-B6E58356ED61", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/10/us/capitals-of-the-confederacy-black-mayors-trnd/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-10-11T00:15:50Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-10-11T00:15:50Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-10-11T00:15:50Z", "path": "/2019/10/10/us/capitals-of-the-confederacy-black-mayors-trnd", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Leah Asmelash, CNN", "contributors": [], "headline": "There were once 3 capitals of the Confederacy.

In Tuesday's mayoral runoff, he defeated TV station owner David Woods, who is white.  Montgomery, where 60% of residents are black, has a complicated racial history. It is the birthplace of the civil rights movement but also was the first capital of the Confederacy. It later became the site of Rosa Parks' bus boycott and the destination of the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery protest marches. The nation's first memorial for more than 4,000 victims of lynchings opened last year there. While the mayor-elect told CNN that it might have been a number of factors that delayed the state capital city's election of a black mayor, it's now time to move forward.  \"We've been unified on the message of opportunity and creating an environment where people can live, learn and earn,\" Reed said.  \"We're a city that's facing some challenges regarding our public schools, facing challenges about what is our economic future and how do we recruit and retain talent and resources here? How do we grow the economy? And certainly, we're trying to deal with issues around criminal justice,\" he said.  Top Democrats congratulate Reed Reed's historic election drew national praise, with several Democratic presidential candidates congratulating him. \"The birthplace of the civil rights movement has a new era of leadership for the first time in its 200-year history,\" Sen. Kamala Harris tweeted. Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted: \"Congratulations to @StevenLouisReed on his historic election as Montgomery, Alabama's first African American mayor! I can't wait to see the big, structural change you make.\" Reed tweeted that he spoke with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who congratulated him on his victory. Reed will be sworn into office in November, replacing Mayor Todd Strange, who has held office since 2009. Strange did not run for reelection. In Reed's first 100 days in office, he wants to focus on public education and restoring trust between the police and the community, two issues he ran on, he told CNN. \"We want to let everyone know that this is a new Montgomery,\" Reed said. \"This is a new day, and we're going to be a great part and a great asset to this country.\"", "sourceId": "article_9E222762-5360-3422-F1C0-B622E6AAEBE0", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/10/us/montgomery-alabama-mayor-new-day-cnntv/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-10-10T15:52:31Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-10-10T19:47:18Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-10-10T19:47:18Z", "path": "/2019/10/10/us/montgomery-alabama-mayor-new-day-cnntv", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Aditi Sangal, CNN", "contributors": ["Aditi Sangal"], "headline": "Montgomery, Alabama's first black mayor-elect says he wants his city seen as a part of the New South", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191008112741-02-steven-reed-alabama-montgomery-story-body.jpg", "tickers": [], "tags": [{"id": "837f61e8-e5be-41b4-b368-c410461238e1"}, {"id": "bd0bf3d7-f33b-4c20-812f-f9ad2b527846"}, {"id": "18f3e242-2811-4e08-9424-145261521f2c"}, {"id": "7691bc4e-7b66-4400-9ce9-789f697ada59"}, {"id": "bbeba556-f98f-4db4-bbee-d73b417eb1c3"}, {"id": "14ceb160-f89f-442e-9185-c6eaa7b9081d"}, {"id": "45ad4383-fca7-4ae3-9c9d-14c190c3118a"}, {"id": "29e2ee2a-6115-4a69-ae08-7518c546b70c"}, {"id": "02a3d568-e861-466e-84a7-982054212603"}, {"id": "02a3d568-e861-466e-84a7-982054212603"}, {"id": "7337f62f-6d14-4d00-b7b0-b21b438ec7ff"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "2a1fbdb6-333a-4b46-9ec8-29ca034d21ad"}, {"id": "28d880a2-7751-4914-8fc2-ea71eb30debc"}, {"id": "be6998eb-1fb8-4c65-aac9-5fc54bac30a5"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "b852b5d8-31c6-49e9-8ff1-986a55356fa1"}, {"id": "15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158"}, {"id": "7bacc4f5-0758-4abd-a57e-c3633bd0f1aa"}, {"id": "fff9d467-32d7-4e5c-b07d-fbea99b5b2c3"}, {"id": "b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c"}, {"id": "ba149945-03c8-4584-83c3-13dd4e4b89cd"}, {"id": "c8456516-b9be-42bc-ac2f-c96364001bee"}, {"id": "9261d1e3-22b8-4595-b007-98f15d561ba0"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "9458a483-8643-4b0a-abcf-aebd1c51cf12"}, {"id": "95e6524c-9692-4f20-99de-7e4a401a69e6"}, {"id": "c753c773-f66f-52cb-ba12-1bdf4573b592"}, {"id": "80f3b9c3-a02e-5894-9465-e9338d4d0532"}, {"id": "9c5826c0-329c-54ce-b065-3826ae02b3ab"}, {"id": "8c227858-cddf-41b4-9eee-7acdde84ad8c"}, {"id": "d73e719e-040c-4840-a2a6-c04b8310dfcb"}, {"id": "9b9aed9f-e3a5-479a-81e5-600f0b0cb607"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}]}, {"_id": "h_9346f05f184c77818e7b7bd9db036825", "type": "article", "body": "Check out the ski slope in Copenhagen that's built atop a power plant.

Turkey Turkey launched its military offensive into northeastern Syria, hammering Kurdish forces with airstrikes and artillery fire. Reports on the ground paint a chaotic scene, with roads gridlocked\u00a0with people trying to flee to safety. There are also reports of civilian causalities, as some worry that this could be the start of a \"humanitarian catastrophe.\"  The Kurdish forces have dropped their counter-ISIS operations to focus on the Turkish offensive, raising fears that all this could lead to a resurgence of ISIS. US officials have also expressed concern that thousands of ISIS fighters may escape from prisons in Syria. Asked about that, President Trump essentially shrugged it off, saying it's not America's problem, since the fighters would be \"escaping\u00a0to Europe.\"\u00a0Click here to keep up with the latest on the offensive. 2. Impeachment inquiry House Democrats are prepping a wave of subpoenas\u00a0after the Trump administration said it would ignore them. Democrats are now threatening to subpoena associates of Rudy Giuliani and State Department officials. That would include\u00a0former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. She's set for an interview Friday, but she may not appear because she's still a State Department employee. Democrats are also debating whether to hold a vote to formally authorize the impeachment inquiry. The White House and Trump's GOP defenders say until that happens, the entire effort is invalid; the Dems say it's not required under the Constitution. A new poll shows more than half of US voters want the President impeached and removed from office. Meantime, former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0for the first time\u00a0called for Trump's impeachment. 3. German synagogue attack A gunman's attack in the eastern German town of Halle was horrifying. But it could have been a lot worse if he'd been able to break down a synagogue's doors. The gunman, who was arrested, killed two people: one right outside the synagogue and one at a nearby shop. But he couldn't get through the doors of the synagogue, and that likely spared the lives of the 70 to 80 people\u00a0inside for Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar.\u00a0The attack was apparently livestreamed on Twitch, a platform owned by Amazon, and bore a striking similarity to the live video of the Christchurch attack in March in New Zealand. 4. California power outages Long days of darkness continue\u00a0for almost 800,000 PG&E customers in Northern California, after the utility giant cut off power in several counties to reduce the risk of setting off wildfires with\u00a0electrical lines. The outages could last as long as a week for some.\u00a0A forecast of strong winds is posing a major fire danger, but the winds are expected to subside tomorrow. Then\u00a0PG&E crews will examine their system for damage and start turning the power back on.\u00a0 5. Weather It's going to be a wet and windy end of the workweek and weekend on the East Coast, as a fall nor'easter --\u00a0with wind gusts approaching tropical-storm-force --\u00a0slams an area stretching from Delaware to Massachusetts. Meanwhile in the north-central US, temperatures\u00a0are expected to plummet as much as 50 degrees in 24 hours ahead of an intense and potentially historic fall snowstorm. Temps in Denver were in the 80s yesterday, but they'll be below freezing today.\u00a0Snow is expected in Colorado, the Dakotas, Wyoming, Montana and parts of Idaho, and it could shatter records for this time of the year.

Gerstein was the master behind such books like \"The Night World,\" \"The Sleeping Gypsy,\" and \"The Man Who Walked Between the Towers,\" which won him the Caldecott Award for distinguished American children's picture books in 2004. He died on September 24 at his home in Westhampton, Massachusetts, the New York Times reported. His wife, artist Susan Yard Harris, told the Times that he died of metastatic esophageal cancer.  Gerstein had always been an artist, attending art school in his native Los Angeles and moving to New York shortly after. He made a living painting and designing animated TV commercials and kid's shows but all that changed in 1970, when he met author Elizabeth Levy. Levy, a young author at the time, had written a mystery book for children and asked Gerstein to illustrate it. He did, launching a long career that spanned decades. \"From the first, I loved the picture book medium. It was film and drawing and theater all in one,\" he wrote on his website.  With Levy's encouragement, he began writing his own books. His first, \"Arnold of the Ducks,\" was published in 1983. Gerstein wrote and illustrated more than 40 books during his career, receiving over a dozen awards. The book that won the Caldecott Award, \"The Man Who Walked Between the Towers,\" was published in 2003. It told the story of the French high-wire walker Philippe Petit, who strung a cable between the two towers of the World Trade Center in August 1974. Petit then spent an hour walking, sitting and dancing on the cable as awestruck spectators watched from the streets below. \"I didn't want to just tell the story of the walk \u2014 I wanted the book to be the walk between cardboard covers,\" he said in his speech accepting the award. He addressed the destruction of the towers in the 9/11 attacks in a simple yet poignant way. The book ended with a page that only had these words: \"Now the towers are gone.\" Gerstein's subject matter ranged from retellings of Bible stories to imaginary worlds \u2014 often delving into larger questions about life and the human experience. \"Each book seems to be, in some way, essentially different from the others; I have to learn to make each one, and each is a surprise to me,\" he wrote. \"I think that making books, or any kind of art, might also be like mining. Artists dig down into their lives and imaginations and never know what they'll find there. It's always an adventure.\" He once said that all his books are about people and that all stories, in some ways, are about \"this mystery of being a human being.\" \"What are we here for, and what are we doing? What are we supposed to do? How am I supposed to be a kid? How do I be a teenager? How do I be me? I think all stories are about that, and my stories certainly are,\" he said in a 2005 interview with TeachingBooks.net.  About his artistic process, he continued, \"I imagine that I'm the person and try to draw the feeling of what it's like to be that person.\"", "sourceId": "article_CD31AAC6-04D1-B293-683E-9D55C433F90B", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/05/us/mordicai-gerstein-death-trnd/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-10-05T19:54:46Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-10-05T19:54:46Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-10-05T19:54:46Z", "path": "/2019/10/05/us/mordicai-gerstein-death-trnd", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Leah Asmelash, CNN", "contributors": [], "headline": "Mordicai Gerstein, children's book author and illustrator, dies at 83", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191005145738-02-mordicai-gerstein-trnd-story-body.jpg", "tickers": [], "tags": [{"id": "ab455b9b-7fac-49fb-bd04-df6bd68f2811"}, {"id": "b21c6c7c-6fe4-4f10-85da-b81821c55578"}, {"id": "3bfc5b1d-f595-449c-9d7d-6bda8723b3a6"}, {"id": "9be60ad9-610a-433a-9dc5-98f9545764b1"}, {"id": "7e0328a4-4bbc-48a2-b07d-ff579111a5fd"}, {"id": "cbf09cf3-b112-5b77-a53f-c26db13be012"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d"}, {"id": "3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "b47de7d7-778d-4298-88b4-f9aa442eb3af"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "0bcada57-91e2-5622-92f6-39556eea8599"}, {"id": "f4cd3feb-5eed-561f-9f2d-6b8b53bc8111"}, {"id": "9c5826c0-329c-54ce-b065-3826ae02b3ab"}, {"id": "634295f7-23ed-5bbe-8d47-341601b7159e"}, {"id": "9b9aed9f-e3a5-479a-81e5-600f0b0cb607"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}]}, {"_id": "h_6786fe2bf513d72060c03641d6353477", "type": "article", "body": "Today we'll get a look at the September jobs report.

(You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. President Trump\u00a0 The revelations keep coming in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump's relationship with Ukraine. Trump's former special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, yesterday released text messages exchanged with\u00a0a Ukrainian aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The text messages, sent before the July 25\u00a0call at the center of the impeachment inquiry, provide a tangible link between the call and Trump's request that Ukraine investigate his political interests.  Trump doubled down on his actions, saying in a tweet that he has the \"absolute right\" as president to ask other countries to investigate \"corruption.\" He also told reporters at the White House that China should also launch in investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden (the subjects of Trump's interest in Ukraine communications); there is no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. Meanwhile, a satirical video about the Bidens that Trump tweeted out has been removed from Twitter after a copyright complaint. The video featured a long-running internet joke involving a song by Canadian rock band Nickelback.  2. Paris knife attack Four people were killed yesterday in a knife attack at the Paris police headquarters. Three officers and an administrative worker were killed by a fellow staff member, a 45-year-old man who had been\u00a0an employee since 2003 at the police station, which is on the same small island as Notre Dame Cathedral. The attacker\u00a0was shot dead by police. Authorities don't have a motive yet, but the man's wife was taken into custody, and it's unclear if she was present at the scene. A lockdown has since been lifted in the area of the attack, but the incident has left the city shaken. French President Emmanuel Macron and Paris Mayor\u00a0Anne Hidalgo both extended condolences, and Hidalgo says the victims will be formally honored soon. 3. Haiti  A humanitarian crisis is growing in Haiti as anti-government gatherings have shut down schools and resulted in fuel shortages and lack of safe water. Today, protesters are calling for a large gathering in the city's capital of Port-au-Prince to demand the resignation of President Jovenel Moise. Haitians have been calling for Moise to resign for several months over a long list of complaints, including soaring inflation and alleged corruption, but recent demonstrations have caused a different kind of crisis. The United Nations this week said its humanitarian efforts have been impacted by the protests, affecting access to medical care and choking off fuel and water supplies. The UN also said some schools have been closed for the past two weeks, leaving about 2 million children without access to education.  4. Bernie Sanders\u00a0 US Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders says he's planning to\u00a0leave\u00a0the hospital this weekend and will be back in action in time for the next Democratic primary debate. The 78-year-old presidential contender\u00a0had an unscheduled heart procedure this week\u00a0after doctors discovered a blockage in one artery, and his campaign said he would be off the trail for a bit to recover.\u00a0There is no word yet on when exactly\u00a0Sanders will return to his busy 2020\u00a0schedule, but campaign surrogates will fan out across the country this weekend, headlining events in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. According to one aide, the mood inside Sanders' campaign headquarters is \"business as usual.\"\u00a0 5. Eastern Equine Encephalitis A rare, mosquito-borne virus continues to threaten parts of the northeastern US. A fourth person has died in Michigan after contracting Eastern Equine Encephalitis, bringing the nationwide total to 11 deaths. That's an unusual uptick: On average, the country sees five to 10 cases of the virus in an entire year, and 30% of those cases are typically fatal. Connecticut's Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz\u00a0has attributed the spread of the virus to climate change, citing the number of infections in nearby states and their timing so late in the year.\u00a0The CDC says people in\u00a0impacted areas should use insect repellant and avoid the outdoors after dark to lessen their risk.

It boasted about the nearly $200 million it had been spending annually on health care services for detainees, saying that \"comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment detainees arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.\"     What the press release didn't say was that Samimi's death followed a series of lapses in his medical care -- the sort of breakdowns that have been repeatedly identified in government investigations into the care provided at immigrant detention centers in recent years.   Samimi, an Iranian man who was being held by ICE in Aurora, Colorado, had been complaining of vomiting and pain for weeks leading up to his death in 2017, according to ICE's investigation into his treatment. He had told medical staff upon his arrival that he had been taking methadone, a painkiller commonly used to treat opioid addiction, since hurting his back in a car accident. He said he was starting to feel symptoms of withdrawal, yet nurses told investigators they didn't have training in opioid withdrawal.  Read CNN's original investigation into preventable deaths in jails and prisons ICE's report, which involved an outside analysis of his treatment and like other death reviews did not directly connect the medical failures to the death, also found that the facility had been without a director of nursing and another medical provider for more than six months. Around a week before Samimi died, he was found unconscious on the floor of his cell but wasn't sent to the hospital. And on the day he died, a nurse tried calling the doctor multiple times for help after the inmate appeared to have suffered a seizure, but the doctor didn't answer or return any of those calls.   Investigations into deaths including Samimi's, as well as critical government audits, have raised troubling questions about the quality of medical care at facilities used to hold immigrants. One of the main private contractors providing health care in these facilities, which employed the doctor in the detention center where Samimi was held, is a massive company known as Wellpath, formerly Correct Care Solutions.   This company was the focus of a recent CNN investigation that exposed how it has provided substandard care that has led to deaths and other serious outcomes that could have been avoided. Through records and interviews with current and former employees, CNN showed how the company has relied on inexperienced workers, offered minimal training and understaffed facilities -- and how its employees have failed to get inmates the emergency care they needed.    Wellpath also works in some of the country's largest detention facilities, where ICE locks up thousands of immigrants -- many of whom have been apprehended for entering the country illegally.     In addition to at least five death reviews conducted by ICE that specifically cite issues with the contractor's treatment of immigrant detainees, a recent class action lawsuit spotlighted the company's problematic record  -- calling the decision to hire medical contractors such as Wellpath \"disturbing.\" In the suit, more than a dozen current detainees at a variety of detention centers accuse ICE of violating the US Constitution by denying them adequate medical care and failing to provide stronger oversight.   ICE did not comment on Wellpath, but in response to the lawsuit an official said that \"all ICE detainees, regardless of location, can expect timely and appropriate responses to emergent medical requests, and timely medical care appropriate to the anticipated length of detention.\"  Wellpath did not comment on the lawsuit or government findings about specific detainees and facilities, but said in a statement that it is confident its \"team made the best possible care decisions with the information that was available to them.\"   \"Our compassionate team of doctors, nurses and health care providers work with our partners to deliver high quality health care in a clinical environment where security is the highest priority,\" the company said.   Private contractor GEO Group operates a number of the immigrant detention centers where Wellpath provides medical care, and it employed the nurses and other medical staff at the facility where Samimi died. The company declined to comment. Opinion: Policymakers, provide adequate health care in prisons and detention centers One of the class-action plaintiffs, Mart\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz, has Type 2 diabetes and has been detained at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California -- where Wellpath is the medical provider -- for more than two years. He alleges in the suit he was given more than triple his regular dose of insulin, resulting in an overdose. He says he wasn't seen by a doctor after the overdose, and that there have been multiple occasions where he hasn't been given his insulin or blood pressure medication.    The lawsuit states he went without insulin for six days in February and 10 days this summer, without blood pressure medication for two weeks in the spring and without cholesterol medication for a week in July. Mu\u00f1oz, who has lived in the United States for more than 40 years, most recently worked as a handyman and has four children who are US citizens.     Another current detainee at the Adelanto facility alleges he lost vision in one eye when a recommended surgery wasn't provided, while a man held at California's Mesa Verde immigrant detention center  -- where Wellpath is also the medical provider -- claims in the lawsuit that he has received no treatment for a severe parasite in his brain.     At least 27 people have died while being held in ICE custody since 2017, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of several advocacy organizations involved with the suit. An ICE official said in a statement that \"statistically, fatalities in ICE custody occur approximately 100 times less often (than) they do in both federal and state custody nationwide.\"   Related: 19 years old, in jail and begging to go to the hospital Lawmakers who have previously criticized the conditions and medical care at ICE facilities have also expressed serious concerns to CNN about Wellpath.    \"The reports of widespread and sometimes deadly deficiencies in the medical care provided by Correct Care Solutions ... are deeply troubling,\" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, in a statement provided to CNN. \"The United States government has a moral obligation to respect the dignity of every individual in its care, and that mission is severely compromised when government agencies transfer responsibility to private corporations incentivized to cut costs and turn profits.\"    In December 2018, Harris and a group of other California lawmakers wrote a letter to ICE, condemning the agency for the \"egregious violations\" identified during an inspection of the Adelanto detention center.   In its 2018 report, a Department of Homeland Security watchdog said it had found that detainees did not \"have timely access to proper medical care\" and that doctors were indicating they had seen patients they didn't actually visit. ICE said at the time that it takes the findings seriously and would be conducting a review to ensure standards are now being met.    \"We must ensure that migrants in our custody are treated with the care and respect they deserve,\" Rep. Scott Peters, D-California, told CNN. \"Wellpath must be appropriately investigated, and should not be awarded any contracts until such an investigation has been completed.\"    Colorado Rep. Jason Crow said he has similar concerns about the medical care at the immigrant detention center in his district, the Aurora facility where Samimi died.   The ACLU of Colorado recently released a report condemning Samimi's medical care, saying that the doctor \"made the medically unjustifiable decision to cut him off from his prescribed methadone.\" Samimi had even called a friend and told him he was \"sicker than hell\" and \"dying here,\" according to the death review obtained by the organization and Rocky Mountain PBS. The ACLU is currently suing ICE in an attempt to get more records about what happened. \"ICE arrested a man who had lived in the US for over four decades, and 15 days later he died in ICE's care,\" the ACLU said in a statement about Samimi's death. \"The public deserves to know more.\" Do you have information to share?

It was soon after an encounter between a Sikh family and Harris County sheriff's deputies had gone horribly wrong. The family had called to report a burglary, but when deputies arrived and saw their kirpans -- small swords that are an Sikh article of faith -- they treated the family as if they were the criminals. Adrian Garcia had just been elected Harris County sheriff, and wanted to make things right with the Sikh community. So he visited the neighborhood's gurdwara and made a plea: Join the force to help change the department from the inside. Dhaliwal turned to his father and said he wanted to join the sheriff's department. Friends and family tried to talk him out of it. \"I thought he had lost his mind,\" said BJ Josan, a childhood friend.  Law enforcement wasn't a profession that Sikhs in Houston entered, Josan told CNN. Besides, Dhaliwal had other things going for him, like his trucking and pizza businesses. But Dhaliwal's mind was made up, his father, Piara Singh Dhaliwal, told CNN Tuesday. He was intent on making a difference in the city he grew up in.  And he certainly did. Nearly everyone in this part of Houston -- where Dhaliwal, 42, was gunned down last week during a traffic stop -- knew who he was. His turban and beard, markers of his Sikh faith, made him hard to miss.  Those closest to him want others to know that Dhaliwal was a child at heart, an exceptional spirit, a friend to everyone and, in the words of one colleague, \"a damn near saint.\" \"We've had many law enforcement officers who have paid a similar sacrifice and they were all good people,\" said Garcia, the former sheriff, who hired Dhaliwal and is now Harris County Commissioner. \"But I want people to understand that the things that you're hearing about Sandeep are absolutely true.\" He wanted to be out on the street, not behind a desk Piara Singh Dhaliwal said people in the community told him law enforcement was dangerous and that he should persuade Sandeep not to do it. But the father decided to support his son's decision. Someone had to do the job, he said. The younger Dhaliwal joined the force as a detention officer in 2009 and eventually worked his way up to deputy.  He was the first Sikh deputy in the Harris County Sheriff's Office, one of the largest departments in the nation. When he got permission in 2015 to wear his turban and beard as part of his uniform, it made headlines as a victory for Sikhs everywhere -- and paved the way for other Sikhs to join the department. Serving in law enforcement as a turbaned Sikh had its challenges, but friends and colleagues say Dhaliwal never let on. He took pride in his role in law enforcement, knowing that he was representing the Sikh community in a very visible way.  \"He wanted to show that a Sikh person with a turban is a symbol of someone who's there to provide service, to provide help whenever you need it,\" Josan said. And it was his nature to defuse any strange look or rude question with a smile or a joke. Garcia and others in the department encouraged him to make rank -- to seek a promotion that would earn him more responsibility and pay. The deputy's father, Piara Singh Dhaliwal, told CNN his son had actually passed the exam to become a sergeant. But Dhaliwal didn't want to sit at a desk and do paperwork. He was happy where he was -- out in the community, interacting with people. \"I don't want to sit in the office,\" he told his father. \"'I don't want to be a sergeant. Maybe next year.'\" At a vigil for Dhaliwal on Monday night, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez recalled a resident telling him she was having trouble closing her garage door and needed to get to work. Dhaliwal told her not to worry and that he would keep watch over her house. Desmond Spivey, a fellow deputy, said that he worked night shifts while Dhaliwal worked days.  Normally, their paths wouldn't cross. But on many nights when Spivey was patrolling the neighborhood, Dhaliwal would stop by to say hello.  \"He'd just drive by in his personal vehicle in the middle of the night just to check on me,\" Spivey said. Dhaliwal would tell him, \"'Hey, if you need anything, man, I'm just one call away.'\" Dhaliwal had a special connection with everyone, Josan said, but especially kids. He went out of his way to talk to them, to make them feel special. He wanted to inspire them and make them to feel like they could count on him. \"He knew how to interact with kids,\" Josan said. \"He was a big kid himself.\" 'He was always smiling' In Copperfield, a residential community in northwest Harris County, nearly every yard this week displays a sad sign. \"Love One Another. In Loving Memory of Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal,\" they read.  On Tuesday members of the community, a mix of whites, Hispanics, blacks and Asians, kept stopping by a makeshift memorial for the fallen deputy. Scores of candles, bouquets of flowers and American flags dotted the tree-lined street near where Dhaliwal was shot. Judith Aranda knelt and silently lit a candle. She first met Dhaliwal during a memorial for Deputy Darren Goforth, a Harris County deputy who was killed in 2015. Though Aranda said she talked to Dhaliwal only for a few minutes, she felt like she knew him from hearing her parents' accounts of seeing him often at a nearby gas station. \"He was always smiling, always a friendly face,\" Aranda said. Papa Johns locations across southeast Texas pledged to donate proceeds from Tuesday's sales to Dhaliwal's family. But the response was so overwhelming, and the wait times to order pizzas so long, that the pizza chain announced it would extend its fundraiser to Friday. It's a sign of how beloved Dhaliwal was by the community, Aranda said. Houston's affection for Dhaliwal is now translating into support for his wife and their three young children.  A Facebook fundraiser for his kids' educational expenses has raised more than $660,000. A GoFundMe campaign set up by Sikhs of Houston has raised more than $570,000. And a separate GoFundMe campaign by United Sikhs has raised more than $200,000. Vigils in Dhaliwal's memory have been held in New York, New Jersey, California and even Punjab, India, where Dhaliwal's family is originally from. And congregations in gurdwaras as far away as Melbourne, Australia, have honored Dhaliwal in their ardas, a formal Sikh prayer that asks God for strength. He inspired others At the Sikh National Center in Houston, Piara Singh Dhaliwal sat on the ground Tuesday night, surrounded by friends who had traveled from around the country to pay their respects.  He was still in shock over the death of his son a few days earlier and struggled to summon the energy to talk about him.  \"What I want to tell you, I don't think I am able to say right now,\" he said. With a sad smile on his face, the elder Dhaliwal showed a photo on his iPhone lock screen. It was a black-and-white image of a toddler in a patka -- a head covering worn by Sikh boys -- with his parents on either side of him. His son. The photo was taken in India, Dhaliwal said, before the family emigrated to Houston. Soon enough a friend came up to him to offer his condolences.  \"Your hero hasn't gone anywhere,\" the man told the deputy's father. \"Your hero lives on in everyone.

At his funeral Wednesday, the man who effectively recruited him said he was a model for all: A man who lived to serve anyone regardless of background or creed. Thousands gathered Wednesday to honor Dhaliwal, a 42-year-old Harris County sheriff's deputy who was shot and killed Friday during a traffic stop, in a public funeral at the Berry Center arena outside Houston. Speakers saluted Dhaliwal as a pioneer -- he was the first Sikh deputy for the nation's third-largest sheriff's department. He later drew national attention in 2015 when the sheriff's department allowed him to wear a turban and beard in uniform. But they also honored him as a man who raised resources for hurricane victims, cheerfully engaged community members and gave up business pursuits for lower-paid life as a deputy. \"Sandeep was here to teach us. He was here to guide us,\" said Adrian Garcia, the current county commissioner and former sheriff who a decade ago asked Sikhs to join the department -- a call that Dhaliwal answered. \"He was here to help us understand that if we just approach each other on a level of decency, so much good can come from it.\" In one of the funeral's more touching moments, an emotional Garcia addressed Dhaliwal's father, calling him \"Baba,\" a term of endearment for fathers in South Asian culture. \"Baba, you raised a good man. You raised him with a heart of gold,\" Garcia said. \"It is unfair that a father should outlive his son ... but know that (with) this stadium and all those around the world that are watching us, that this celebration of life is fit for a king.\" Dhaliwal was remembered as a light to others Dhaliwal's volunteerism and engagement with community members made him popular around Houston, and his death has resonated, prompting people to flood the internet with photos and videos of him and visit impromptu memorials ahead of the funeral. The funeral was essentially two services in one: The first half focusing on Dhaliwal's faith, and the second led by the sheriff's department, featuring speeches from dignitaries.  Both emphasized a man who lived his faith. The event started with kirtan -- Sikh devotional hymns played on Indian classical instruments, including the harmonium and the tabla.  \"The memory of his prolific service to mankind will be etched in our hearts and minds forever,\" Hardam Singh Azad, the chairman of the board at the Sikh National Center, said at the funeral. The Sikh National Center is the Houston gurdwara, or place of worship, that Dhaliwal attended. Speakers also honored Dhaliwal for pushing the department to allow him to wear the dastaar and his beard, markers of his faith.  One was Simratpal Singh, who as a US Army captain in 2016 became the first active duty soldier to seek and receive accommodation to wear the turban and beard while serving. \"Our dream is that a Sikh like Sandeep, with his unrelenting love of service, should they choose to don the uniform of this nation, that individual will not have to fight the fight that Sandeep fought to serve with his turban and his beard,\" Singh, in uniform, said Wednesday. Sheriff Ed Gonzalez hailed Dhaliwal has a hero who \"brought the entire community together ... in a way that only Sandeep can do.\" \"People followed Sandeep Dhaliwal because he led from the heart,\" Gonzalez told reporters before the service. \"And I hope that that's something that we can impart. ... He taught us about tolerance, he taught us about acceptance, he taught us about love, he taught us how to be a visionary.\" US Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Dhaliwal's surviving relatives, including his three young children, his wife and his father, that the community was with them. Speaking to the children specifically, he added: \"We are grateful to your father's service, his sacrifice, and his legacy.\" His life was marked by service Dhaliwal operated trucking and pizza businesses in young adulthood. But he changed careers after a well-publicized 2008 incident in which Harris County sheriff's deputies incorrectly treated a Sikh family that reported a burglary as criminals, after seeing one member with a ceremonial sword that is a Sikh article of faith. Garcia, then the sheriff-elect, asked local Sikhs to join the department. Dhaliwal answered the call, joining as a detention officer in 2009, and eventually moved his way up to deputy. Dhaliwal's desire to help people marked his life inside and outside the department, those who knew him say.  Dhaliwal helped coordinate disaster relief efforts after 2017's Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of the Houston area, and traveled to Puerto Rico to help after Hurricane Maria.  He helped at-risk youth in Houston, Gurvinder Singh, international director of Sikh aid programs for United Sikhs, said before the funeral.  Even when the deputy was on vacation, Dhaliwal would reach out to the United Sikhs humanitarian organization and ask what programs they were working on in the area so he could help, Singh said. His loss is felt in Houston and around the world Ahead of the funeral, mourners in a hall outside the arena signed a banner dedicated to the fallen deputy.  \"Even though I never met you, I know your story. Wish I could meet you face to face. R.I.P. Brother,\" read one message, signed \"P.O. Singh (NYPD).\" James Arrendell, a former colleague of Dhaliwal's in the sheriff's department, was there with his wife to pay their respects. \"Every memory is a favorite. Like (the speakers) said, every day he always came in, always smiled,\" Arrendell said. \"Doesn't matter if I was in a bad mood or if somebody else was in a bad mood.\" \"He would come talk to you and cheer you up, let you know everything was going to be okay. Dhaliwal was to be cremated at a funeral home later Wednesday afternoon, according to Sikh tradition. The cremation service was for family and members of the sheriff's office. Final prayers -- open to the public -- were to be said afterward at the Sikh National Center. From Monday to Wednesday, the Sikh National Center also held an Akhand Path, a nonstop front-to-back reading of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book. Dhaliwal's loss is being felt both at home in Houston and in communities around the world. A local Chick-fil-A restaurant honored Dhaliwal with a missing man table, a memorial typically found in military dining facilities in memory of fallen service members.  Communities in New York, New Jersey and even Punjab, India, where Dhaliwal was originally from, held vigils in his memory, according to United Sikhs. Congregations in gurdwaras as far away as Melbourne, Australia, honored Dhaliwal in their Ardas, a formal Sikh prayer that asks God for strength. A GoFundMe campaign set up to help his family cover unforeseen expenses and help pay for his three children's education raised more than $570,000 as of Wednesday morning. United Sikhs set up its own GoFundMe campaign, as well as a Facebook fundraiser for the family.

"body": "Missouri prison officials executed convicted murderer Russell Bucklew by lethal injection Tuesday night despite objections from activists who thought the method would lead to a gruesome death, CNN affiliate KFVS reported. Bucklew, 51, was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnapping and first-degree burglary in 1997. He was pronounced dead at 6:23 p.m. CT (7:23 p.m. ET), KFVS said.  Former Cape Girardeau County Prosecutor Morley Swingle, who tried Bucklew, said the death \"was very peaceful.\" A KFVS reporter who witnessed the execution said she could see Bucklew on a gurney with a white sheet up to his chest. Bucklew was looking away from the viewing room. She said he turned his head so that he was looking straight ahead and was twitching his feet. The he let out a sigh, and there was no more movement. The curtains were closed for a few minutes, she said, and reopened with him still on the gurney.  There were no visible complications, she said. Swingle said Bucklew \"closed his eyes and went to sleep.\" Activists were concerned that Bucklew's disease would cause a gruesome death when he was administered drugs at his execution. He had a rare blood vessel disorder called cavernous hemangioma. The disease can cause tumors in the head and regular bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes and ears. Advocates for calling off the execution were worried the lethal injection would cause prolonged suffocation and excruciating pain. \"We mourn the unnecessary, unlawful execution of Russell Bucklew tonight,\" said Cassandra Stubbs, director of the Capital Punishment Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"Missouri carried out an execution that risked torture and violated international law, despite Mr. Bucklew's remorse and exemplary prison record. The idea that killing this man --  who was terminally ill and had been a model prisoner for 23 years -- was worth the stain on our democracy and our humanity is a disgrace.\" Swingle, the former prosecutor, said Bucklew's death was in stark contrast to the violent death of his victim, Michael Sanders, who was shot in front of his former girlfriend and four children.  Gov. Mike Parson turned down a clemency request, said his press office, without providing additional detail. Bucklew's attorneys had argued the state should have considered death by lethal gas as an alternative. In April, the Supreme Court ruled against Bucklew in a 5-4 decision, which means plans for the lethal injection can proceed.  Justice Neil Gorsuch said the Eighth Amendment \"does not demand the avoidance of all risk of pain\" in carrying out executions. He also said Bucklew had failed to \"present any evidence\" that the substitution of lethal gas would \"significantly reduce his risk of pain,\" Gorsuch said. But the ACLU said executing Bucklew would violate the Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.  \"What makes (Bucklew's) execution different is that he has a medical condition that would make it one of the most gruesome in US history,\" the ACLU wrote.  Bucklew had successfully staved off his execution in the past.  In 2014, the Supreme Court granted Bucklew a stay of execution, pending appeals. Dr. Joel Zivot had filed an affidavit in the case saying that Bucklew's airway is so \"severely compromised and obstructed,\" especially when he's lying flat, that it could easily be ruptured, raising the risk that Bucklew could choke or suffocate. \"If you touch it, it bleeds,\" Zivot wrote of Bucklew's airway. But Gorsuch, the current Supreme Court justice who wrote the majority opinion against Bucklew's case this year, said justice must be served for Bucklew's victims.  \"The people of Missouri, the surviving victims of Mr. Bucklew's crimes, and others like them deserve better,\" Gorsuch wrote. Bucklew was convicted of fatally shooting his ex-girlfriend's presumed new boyfriend, Sanders, and firing at Sanders' son before kidnapping Stephanie Ray Pruitt.  After raping his ex-girlfriend, court documents state, Bucklew was involved in a gunfight in which he and a Missouri state trooper were injured.

"Police say the fatal shooting of a New York Police Department officer was the result of friendly fire. \"This is a tragic case of friendly fire, but make no mistake, we lost a life of a courageous public servant solely due to a violent criminal who put the lives of the police and all the people we serve in jeopardy,\" New York Police Department Commissioner James O'Neill said Monday. Brian Mulkeen, a 33-year-old member of The Bronx Anti-Crime Unit, was investigating gang activity, including recent shootings with two other officers at about 12:30 a.m. Sunday, NYPD said. The officers got out of their vehicle to question a man, who then fled, and the officers gave chase. As the officers tried to apprehend the suspect, a violent struggle on the ground began, NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan previously announced. In body-worn camera, Mulkeen can be heard yelling \"He's reaching for it! He's reaching for it!\" Monahan said earlier. Mulkeen fired five rounds and his partners fired 10 rounds, two of which struck Mulkeen, O'Neill said. Police previously said Mulkeen was hit three times, but O'Neill said one of the wounds was \"an in and out wound.\" \"Officer Mulkeen retained his firearm during the entire violent struggle he had with the suspect,\" O'Neill said. \"Brian was the one who fired his own weapon, and he fired five rounds at the suspect.\" The 27-year-old suspect, Antonio Williams, was shot and killed. He was on probation for a narcotics-related arrest and had served time in prison on a burglary conviction, Sgt. Mary Frances O'Donnell of the NYPD said. He also had been arrested for petty larceny and false documents, she said. O'Neill said Williams' loaded gun was not fired during the incident. Though body-cam video was available, Mulkeen's camera was not activated, O'Neill said. Mulkeen had served on the NYPD for over six and a half years and lived in Yorktown Heights with his girlfriend, who is also an NYPD officer. Mulkeen graduated from Fordham in 2008 and was a two-year field captain for the track and field team, competing in weight throw and hammer throw, the university said. Second friendly-fire death this year for NYPD Mulkeen is the second NYPD officer to be shot and killed on the street this year. In February, an NYPD detective was fatally shot in a friendly fire incident as police responded to a reported robbery at a cell phone store in Queens.  As Det. Brian Simonsen, 42, and a sergeant went in to the store, a suspect came out of a back room with a replica handgun, the NYPD said. The two officers fired, and as they were leaving the store, Simonsen was apparently shot by uniformed officers. The sergeant was struck in the leg, police said.  In addition, nine NYPD officers have died by suicide this year, a cluster that has rattled the department. Sunday's killing comes more than a day after a gunman shot dead Texas Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal, an observant Sikh who gained national attention years ago when he got permission to wear a turban as part of his Harris County Sheriff's Office uniform. Dhaliwal had stopped a man for a traffic violation and was walking back to his patrol car Friday afternoon when he was shot twice, including at least once in the back of the head, authorities said.", "sourceId": "article_E8953FCE-732C-E5BB-420E-8383F1396E75", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/30/us/bronx-officer-shot-dead/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-09-30T20:26:32Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-10-01T01:53:08Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-10-01T01:53:08Z", "path": "/2019/09/30/us/bronx-officer-shot-dead", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Rob Frehse and Ralph Ellis, CNN", "contributors": ["Jamiel Lynch", "Eric Levenson", "Ralph Ellis", "Rob Frehse"], "headline": "NYPD officer killed in the Bronx died by friendly fire, police say", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190929131319-brian-mulkeen-nypd-story-body.jpg"}, {"_id": "h_673f3a2876c035052f98d0cb879e80fd", "type": "article", "body": "Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal made such a profound impact on his community, fellow Texans are carrying on his legacy of service.  The Harris County sheriff's deputy was gunned down Friday during a traffic stop, ending a historic career. \"He touched countless ... lives along the way,\" Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said. \"We will aspire to be as good as he was.\" Dhaliwal first made national headlines almost five years ago, when he successfully pushed for change in the department's policy.  Dhaliwal, a Sikh, became the first deputy in the Houston area to wear a turban and beard while on the force. Sikhism, the world's fifth most popular religion, preaches equality and service to others. The deputy's 10-year career was remarkable not just for breaking barriers, but for his volunteerism and popularity in the Houston area.   Residents flooded the internet with photos and videos of him, including footage of Dhaliwal interacting with a deaf boy at a restaurant.  \"He laughed and joked with all of us, and left a bright impression on my son who is deaf,\" the boy's mother said.  Dhaliwal helped coordinate disaster relief efforts after Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of the Houston area, and traveled to Puerto Rico to help after Hurricane Maria.  He also helped at-risk youth in Houston, said Gurvinder Singh, international director of Sikh aid programs for United Sikhs.  Even when the deputy was on vacation, Singh said, he would reach out to United Sikhs and ask what programs they were working on in the area so he could help. Now, Texans are giving back in honor of the slain deputy.  One GoFundMe campaign to help his wife and three children had raised nearly $450,000 by Monday evening.  Another GoFundMe campaign to help the family, set up by United Sikhs, had raised more than $180,000.  All Papa John's restaurants in the Houston area will donate 100% of their profits Tuesday to Dhaliwal's family, Papa John's Houston posted on Facebook.  And United Sikhs said it has received an uptick in volunteer registrations for its various humanitarian projects.  Before his death, Dhaliwal had planned to start an emergency fund to help first responders after one emergency worker couldn't afford to repair his roof damaged by Hurricane Harvey, United Sikhs said.  So the group said it will create the fund in Dhaliwal's memory.  \"We will make sure that United Sikhs keeps his legacy alive, that we activate his dream and we turn that into a reality,\" Singh said.   A judge says the death penalty is likely  While the community grieves, the man accused of killing Dhaliwal made a court appearance Monday.  Robert Solis, 47, was arrested Friday shortly after Dhaliwal was shot. He faces a charge of capital murder.  \"It is a likely outcome that death will be the sentence here,\" Judge Chris Morton said, according to CNN affiliate KTRK. \"No bond is appropriate.\"  Defense attorney Allen Isbell told KTRK that a capital murder conviction carries life without parole or the death penalty. \"And historically, sometimes they seek the death penalty when a police officer is the victim.\"  Isbell said he has only spoken briefly with Solis but that he is subdued and appears to understand the seriousness of the charge against him. The deputy had stopped Solis for a traffic violation and was walking back to his patrol car Friday afternoon when he was shot twice, including at least once in the back of the head, authorities said.  At the time of the traffic stop, Solis was wanted on a parole violation warrant, the sheriff tweeted.  Authorities haven't said what Solis allegedly did to have violated his parole.  Solis had been out of prison on parole since 2014, 12 years after he was convicted in Harris County of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, court records show.  Dhaliwal's funeral will be at a sports complex Community members are hosting days of events honoring Dhaliwal, including vigils, religious services and a funeral that can accommodate thousands of people.  Starting Monday afternoon, the Sikh National Center was to hold an Akhand Path, a non-stop front-to-back reading of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book.  The Akhand Path will end 48 hours later, on Wednesday. That day, thousands of people are expected to gather at the Berry Center for Dhaliwal's funeral.    The funeral will start with an hour of Sikh prayer, followed by a ceremony led by the Harris County Sheriff's Office. The public is welcome to both events, space permitting, the sheriff's department said.  Members of the congregation at the Sikh National Center said they were still in shock over the beloved deputy's death. \"We're thinking that something like this couldn't happen,\" said Amrik Singh, a leader at the gurdwara that Dhaliwal attended. \"Even now, we feel that (he) will come back.\"", "sourceId": "article_BA53CD69-9C3C-64DA-ED62-8214BA2D246F", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/30/us/texas-sikh-deputy-killed-monday/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-09-30T16:01:00Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-10-01T00:01:52Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-10-01T00:01:52Z", "path": "/2019/09/30/us/texas-sikh-deputy-killed-monday", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Holly Yan and Harmeet Kaur, CNN", "contributors": ["Holly Yan", "Harmeet Kaur"], "headline": "Houstonians honor a Sikh deputy killed in the line of duty by spreading his legacy of philanthropy", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190927190511-sandeep-dhaliwal-story-body.jpg", "tags": [{"id": "ebe63711-0348-4c45-8c98-12d453234b73"}, {"id": "fd529c2d-a4f7-4f7e-b39a-850e8a28c03f"}, {"id": "b21c6c7c-6fe4-4f10-85da-b81821c55578"}, {"id": "622ef793-751e-43b8-8b61-81a6e49b8a43"}, {"id": "79e68efe-c60a-4a30-a061-75907457608a"}, {"id": "40acf5f7-7996-4d60-bad2-489ef77cddf4"}, {"id": "8d7177ef-0a7e-44b5-9a58-6c98c0968023"}, {"id": "f6e26bc9-c50a-4e23-a6ce-bf9a4e4a9504"}, {"id": "86f1d6f8-6a48-4e2c-8c1c-d3a9cbc794c2"}, {"id": "95517c38-aa5b-40e8-8237-2d99dbf0f73e"}, {"id": "f9db38ea-79d0-47f3-ab4e-727f792232a5"}, {"id": "ffed5327-f7f4-41ba-b6a0-bae9f1fd23c5"}, {"id": "bbeba556-f98f-4db4-bbee-d73b417eb1c3"}, {"id": "11c523af-1abf-53de-9e0b-87db225b1e68"}, {"id": "7293d40c-66f5-5061-8948-f207c942277d"}, {"id": "7293d40c-66f5-5061-8948-f207c942277d"}, {"id": "5650d962-d7f0-5810-89b5-67dd679215a0"}, {"id": "87fbffda-480d-531d-9138-caf23d9263b1"}, {"id": "c7e52082-094d-5d63-b82e-4b8d5a9048b9"}, {"id": "f1455243-d0dd-5364-963d-16990accddbe"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "2a1fbdb6-333a-4b46-9ec8-29ca034d21ad"}, {"id": "28d880a2-7751-4914-8fc2-ea71eb30debc"}, {"id": "c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d"}, {"id": "3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "b852b5d8-31c6-49e9-8ff1-986a55356fa1"}, {"id": "15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158"}, {"id": "7bacc4f5-0758-4abd-a57e-c3633bd0f1aa"}, {"id": "3f9c3ae3-f072-4733-ad97-4748ce5e9bba"}, {"id": "b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c"}, {"id": "ba149945-03c8-4584-83c3-13dd4e4b89cd"}, {"id": "c8456516-b9be-42bc-ac2f-c96364001bee"}, {"id": "aa67276b-8530-439b-914f-1be2979f9bc7"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "f5ccd314-0f61-5864-8b2e-555af1905b3c"}, {"id": "b6d6e4db-1f4a-5950-9bbb-b70fad2178b1"}, {"id": "b5614d46-52cd-5543-b861-ebb8e317d371"}, {"id": "f16b72d7-1fcb-5ab1-9804-ad08747d40b9"}, {"id": "1804359b-a654-428b-8e8a-d081c8ade29a"}, {"id": "7f9e3331-436d-4b95-8a53-05c644fe2597"}, {"id": "f6a88258-a64e-4d46-93dc-9a03e48ac594"}, {"id": "9c5826c0-329c-54ce-b065-3826ae02b3ab"}, {"id": "f52a3097-50e1-5dc2-9feb-7d7c026fb3c2"}, {"id": "f0a0d4d0-7cb3-5328-89b8-73721db659bf"}, {"id": "371d0edb-606f-5060-9394-aa93235b9684"}, {"id": "a7dc7f2e-f980-5b00-b8cc-1356195e7b69"}, {"id": "9e77e33a-ec67-5055-bb7a-f945a97882b6"}, {"id": "bd7ac37a-ac39-4178-99cf-d642e85ef5ca"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "tickers": []}, {"_id": "h_d53945aab65f0063fa176dc993c6ee23", "type": "article", "body": "The Sikh community in Houston and around the world is mourning the loss of Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal, the trailblazing sheriff's deputy in Harris County, Texas, who was shot and killed during a traffic stop Friday. At the Sikh National Center in Houston, the gurdwara Dhaliwal attended, preparations are underway for the funeral.  \"It's a huge loss to our community and the younger generations that we hoped he would inspire,\" Hardam Singh Azad, the chairman of the board at Sikh National Center, told CNN. Thousands of people are expected to gather at the Berry Center in Houston on Wednesday to honor the fallen deputy's life and legacy in a ceremony open to the public. The event will start with an hour of Sikh prayer, followed by a ceremony led by the Harris County Sheriff's Office. Sikh funeral traditions will soon take place at the local gurdwara.

The Akhand Path will conclude 48 hours later, on Wednesday. Dhaliwal will be cremated at a local funeral home later Wednesday afternoon, according to Sikh tradition. The cremation service will be for family and members of the sheriff's office, and final prayers will be said afterward at the Sikh National Center. Dhaliwal always wanted to help others Members of the congregation at the Sikh National Center said they were still in shock over the death of Dhaliwal.  \"We're thinking that something like this couldn't happen,\" Amrik Singh, a leader at the gurdwara, told CNN. \"Even now, we feel that (he) will come back.\"  Singh described Dhaliwal as a religious man who proudly wore his turban on duty with the sheriff's office. Dhaliwal gained national attention when he sought and received special permission to wear the Sikh articles of faith as part of his uniform.  \"The elders in the community feel like they lost their son. Those his age feel like they lost a brother,\" Singh said. Dhaliwal was someone who always wanted to help others, Singh said. He recalled the deputy telling him that he wanted to start a free food bus to feed homeless people in Houston because he couldn't bear the thought of anyone in his community going hungry.  Gurvinder Singh, international director of Sikh Aid programs for United Sikhs, said he got to know Dhaliwal through the deputy's countless volunteer efforts with the nonprofit organization. Dhaliwal served as the director of homeland security for the organization, helping advise Sikh communities on dealing with potential hate crime threats and advocating for their religious rights. Dhaliwal helped coordinate disaster relief efforts to communities affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Maria. He helped lead a team of volunteers that delivered water and other necessities to farmers surviving a drought in his ancestral village in Punjab, India. He also assisted at-risk youth in Houston, Singh said. Anytime Dhaliwal was on vacation, Singh said, he would reach out to United Sikhs and ask about what programs they were working on in the area so he could help.  \"That goes to show the character of the man Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal,\" Singh said.  Dhaliwal is inspiring others  Dhaliwal's loss is being felt both at home in Houston and in communities around the world. Sunday, the NFL's Houston Texans honored the deputy in a moment of silence before their game against the Carolina Panthers.  A local Chick-fil-A restaurant honored Dhaliwal with a missing man table, a memorial typically found in military dining facilities in memory of fallen service members.  Communities in New York, New Jersey and even Punjab, India, where Dhaliwal is originally from, held vigils in his memory, according to United Sikhs. Congregations in gurdwaras as far away as Melbourne, Australia, honored Dhaliwal in their Ardas, a formal Sikh prayer that asks God for strength. A GoFundMe campaign set up to help his family cover unforeseen expenses and help pay for his three children's education had raised nearly $400,000 as of Monday. United Sikhs has also set up its own GoFundMe campaign, as well as a Facebook fundraiser for the family.  Dhaliwal continues to inspire others. Since Friday, United Sikhs reports it has received an uptick in volunteer registrations for its various humanitarian projects.  The organization also told CNN that it plans to launch an emergency fund Wednesday to assist first responders -- a project Dhaliwal had hoped to start after he witnessed a first responder who didn't have the financial resources to repair his own roof after Hurricane Harvey. \"We will make sure that United Sikhs keeps his legacy alive, that we activate his dream and we turn that into a reality,\" Gurvinder Singh said.", "sourceId": "article_F3C78718-882A-1733-A8C0-7E42141B7F64", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/29/us/texas-sikh-deputy-funeral-services/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-09-29T23:49:02Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-09-30T16:30:35Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-09-30T16:30:35Z", "path": "/2019/09/29/us/texas-sikh-deputy-funeral-services", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Harmeet Kaur, CNN", "contributors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "headline": "The Sikh community in Houston prepares for the funeral of Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190927190511-sandeep-dhaliwal-story-body.jpg", "tags": [{"id": "ebe63711-0348-4c45-8c98-12d453234b73"}, {"id": "fd529c2d-a4f7-4f7e-b39a-850e8a28c03f"}, {"id": "b21c6c7c-6fe4-4f10-85da-b81821c55578"}, {"id": "622ef793-751e-43b8-8b61-81a6e49b8a43"}, {"id": "79e68efe-c60a-4a30-a061-75907457608a"}, {"id": "3512d6d8-b2e5-4f74-97f6-024ab343c13a"}, {"id": "4def486e-3d58-5b83-8838-7731e233111b"}, {"id": "40acf5f7-7996-4d60-bad2-489ef77cddf4"}, {"id": "8d7177ef-0a7e-44b5-9a58-6c98c0968023"}, {"id": "eadfa404-d8f6-48d3-9648-f6e70088e3f5"}, {"id": "95517c38-aa5b-40e8-8237-2d99dbf0f73e"}, {"id": "f9db38ea-79d0-47f3-ab4e-727f792232a5"}, {"id": "bbeba556-f98f-4db4-bbee-d73b417eb1c3"}, {"id": "b6d6e4db-1f4a-5950-9bbb-b70fad2178b1"}, {"id": "c7e52082-094d-5d63-b82e-4b8d5a9048b9"}, {"id": "5905a802-fc93-4093-9c8c-fe1297ac434e"}, {"id": "f1455243-d0dd-5364-963d-16990accddbe"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "2a1fbdb6-333a-4b46-9ec8-29ca034d21ad"}, {"id": "28d880a2-7751-4914-8fc2-ea71eb30debc"}, {"id": "c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d"}, {"id": "3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734"}, {"id": "bfbad1a7-137f-47f7-9126-daaaf3f3984c"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "b852b5d8-31c6-49e9-8ff1-986a55356fa1"}, {"id": "a4d99550-b3e5-4316-a33a-fa71fbd84509"}, {"id": "18c54269-4f99-4b31-b32d-9d1896c1213c"}, {"id": "15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158"}, {"id": "7bacc4f5-0758-4abd-a57e-c3633bd0f1aa"}, {"id": "3f9c3ae3-f072-4733-ad97-4748ce5e9bba"}, {"id": "b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c"}, {"id": "ba149945-03c8-4584-83c3-13dd4e4b89cd"}, {"id": "c8456516-b9be-42bc-ac2f-c96364001bee"}, {"id": "aa67276b-8530-439b-914f-1be2979f9bc7"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "1804359b-a654-428b-8e8a-d081c8ade29a"}, {"id": "9c5826c0-329c-54ce-b065-3826ae02b3ab"}, {"id": "f52a3097-50e1-5dc2-9feb-7d7c026fb3c2"}, {"id": "f0a0d4d0-7cb3-5328-89b8-73721db659bf"}, {"id": "371d0edb-606f-5060-9394-aa93235b9684"}, {"id": "9e77e33a-ec67-5055-bb7a-f945a97882b6"}, {"id": "bd7ac37a-ac39-4178-99cf-d642e85ef5ca"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "tickers": []}, {"_id": "h_d7a478076c23ee711149447109f83a2c", "type": "article", "body": "Headed to Amsterdam?

Whistleblower controversy An agreement has been reached to have the anonymous whistleblower who filed a complaint against President Trump testify before the House Intelligence Committee. But just when that will happen is still up in the air. Committee chair Adam Schiff says protecting the whistleblower's identity is a primary concern. Trump tweeted up a storm about the whistleblower over the weekend, saying he deserves to \"meet my accuser.\" The President's escalating threats prompted lawyers representing the whistleblower to send letters to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, expressing concerns for the person's safety.   2. Jamal Khashoggi killing Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said he didn't order the October 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Bin Salman, in an interview on CBS's \"60 Minutes,\" said he took full responsibility for it though, since the killing was carried out by people working for the Saudi government. The CIA concluded that bin Salman did indeed personally order Khashoggi's murder. Khashoggi was killed and dismembered after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. 3. Hong Kong protests The 17th consecutive weekend of anti-government protests in Hong Kong was one of the most violent. Protesters hurled Molotov cocktails, tossed bricks and lit fires. Police responded with tear gas, a live warning shot and a water cannon that fired blue dye (used to stain protesters to make them easier to identity later). The violence comes right before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, when Beijing hopes to project an image of national strength and unity with huge military parade.   4. Texas deputy killed The death of a trailblazing sheriff's deputy in Harris County, Texas, is being felt worldwide. Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal was shot and killed during a traffic stop Friday. He was an observant Sikh who years ago gained national attention when he got permission to wear a turban as part of his Harris County Sheriff's Office uniform. Now the Sikh community in Houston and around the world is mourning his loss. Thousands of people are expected to gather at a basketball arena in Houston later this week to honor his life.   5. Weather It's not October yet but Montana is already covered with almost two feet of snow. A winter storm is still blowing through the state and other parts of the Rockies. A winter-storm warning will be in effect for portions of north-central Montana through this morning. In addition to the snow, there are reports of downed trees and power lines. Snow in September in this part of the country isn't all that uncommon, but the amount of snow is unusual for this time of the year. Meanwhile, way out in the Atlantic, Hurricane Lorenzo is churning through the ocean as a Category 3 storm. Lorenzo briefly was a powerful Category 5 storm over the weekend before it weakened. It's the strongest hurricane recorded so far north and east in the Atlantic basin. Lorenzo is expected to pass over the Azores islands in a few days. BREAKFAST BROWSE People are talking about these.

Brian Mulkeen, a 33-year-old member of The Bronx Anti-Crime Unit, was investigating gang activity, including recent shootings with two other officers at about 12:30 a.m. Sunday, NYPD said.  The officers got out of their vehicle to question a man, who then fled, and the officers gave chase. As the officers tried to apprehend the suspect, a violent struggle on the ground began, NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan said. In body-worn camera, Mulkeen can be heard yelling \"He's reaching for it. He's reaching for it,\" Monahan said. Multiple shots were fired and Mulkeen was shot three times. He was pronounced dead at a hospital soon after. Five officers at the scene fired their weapons, striking and killing the suspect. The 27-year-old was on probation for a narcotics-related arrest last year and had several prior arrests, including a burglary in Rockland County, Monahan said.  A firearm believed to be the suspect's was recovered at the scene, NYPD said. Monahan said it appeared that gun was not fired, but Mulkeen's gun was fired five times. \"At this point, we are not sure who fired Officer Mulkeen's gun,\" he said. Mulkeen had served on the NYPD for over six and a half years and lived in Yorktown Heights with his girlfriend, who is also an NYPD officer. \"As we stand here this morning, a young man with a bright future who courageously patrolled some of New York City's toughest streets has tragically lost his life,\" Monahan said. \"Brian was a great cop dedicated to keeping this city safe.\" \"There is no worse a moment in our profession than this,\" NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill tweeted. \"Please keep Brian's family & colleagues in your thoughts.\" Mulkeen is the second NYPD officer to be shot and killed on the street this year. In February, an NYPD detective was fatally shot in a friendly fire incident as police responded to a reported robbery in Queens. The suspect had a replica handgun, police said.  In addition, nine NYPD officers have died by suicide this year, a cluster that has rattled the department. Sunday's killing comes more than a day after a gunman shot dead Texas Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal, an observant Sikh who gained national attention years ago when he got permission to wear a turban as part of his Harris County Sheriff's Office uniform. Dhaliwal had stopped a man for a traffic violation and was walking back to his patrol car Friday afternoon when he was shot twice, including at least once in the back of the head, authorities said. Mulkeen graduated from Fordham in 2008 and was a two-year field captain for the track and field team, competing in weight throw and hammer throw, the university said.", "sourceId": "article_49ABAAE8-A37A-AE4E-53DC-7C5E099395B9", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/29/us/bronx-officer-shot-dead/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-09-29T09:49:03Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-09-29T17:15:20Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-09-29T17:15:20Z", "path": "/2019/09/29/us/bronx-officer-shot-dead", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Jamiel Lynch and Eric Levenson, CNN", "contributors": ["Jamiel Lynch", "Eric Levenson"], "headline": "NYPD officer investigating gang activity was shot dead in the Bronx", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190929131319-brian-mulkeen-nypd-story-body.jpg", "tags": [{"id": "fd529c2d-a4f7-4f7e-b39a-850e8a28c03f"}, {"id": "b21c6c7c-6fe4-4f10-85da-b81821c55578"}, {"id": "79e68efe-c60a-4a30-a061-75907457608a"}, {"id": "3512d6d8-b2e5-4f74-97f6-024ab343c13a"}, {"id": "9016b216-6064-48d0-8de9-8f00e49fad44"}, {"id": "eed52bc5-e96a-43f0-bcfa-662dd1c61660"}, {"id": "8d7177ef-0a7e-44b5-9a58-6c98c0968023"}, {"id": "bbeba556-f98f-4db4-bbee-d73b417eb1c3"}, {"id": "507605ee-a283-465c-8a9c-60a7c00ec0e2"}, {"id": "c7e52082-094d-5d63-b82e-4b8d5a9048b9"}, {"id": "5905a802-fc93-4093-9c8c-fe1297ac434e"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "2a1fbdb6-333a-4b46-9ec8-29ca034d21ad"}, {"id": "28d880a2-7751-4914-8fc2-ea71eb30debc"}, {"id": "c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d"}, {"id": "3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "b852b5d8-31c6-49e9-8ff1-986a55356fa1"}, {"id": "49b3767f-e5b3-40be-aee2-f6c1d7c9fe7c"}, {"id": "efcad6e7-281e-4bba-87fc-4cec06d91412"}, {"id": "15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158"}, {"id": "7bacc4f5-0758-4abd-a57e-c3633bd0f1aa"}, {"id": "b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c"}, {"id": "e16f6ee7-9011-4461-be10-942f7d337881"}, {"id": "ba149945-03c8-4584-83c3-13dd4e4b89cd"}, {"id": "b3b8945f-0d24-4fb9-b6cb-73e8b9d257f3"}, {"id": "5c2d675b-485d-4c56-a5b7-0b2ec77d3601"}, {"id": "c8456516-b9be-42bc-ac2f-c96364001bee"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "c2e82037-93f5-502f-b75b-0cb7b8316689"}, {"id": "1804359b-a654-428b-8e8a-d081c8ade29a"}, {"id": "f0a0d4d0-7cb3-5328-89b8-73721db659bf"}, {"id": "371d0edb-606f-5060-9394-aa93235b9684"}, {"id": "9e77e33a-ec67-5055-bb7a-f945a97882b6"}, {"id": "12967d01-3194-4c24-b4a8-91f471860718"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "tickers": []}, {"_id": "h_2988605bc4ac7b0b816e3597637131b3", "type": "article", "body": "A man accused of shooting and killing a pioneering Texas sheriff's deputy during a traffic stop was wanted at the time, and that may help explain why the shooting happened, authorities say. Robert Solis, 47, was arrested Friday, shortly after police say he killed Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal, an observant Sikh who years ago gained national attention when he got permission to wear a turban as part of his Harris County Sheriff's Office uniform. Dhaliwal had just stopped Solis for a traffic violation and walking back to his patrol car Friday afternoon when he was shot twice, including at least once in the back of the head, authorities said.  At the time of the traffic stop, Solis was wanted on a parole violation warrant, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said on Twitter. Authorities haven't said what Solis allegedly did to have violated his parole. Solis has been out of prison on parole since 2014, 12 years after he was convicted in Harris County of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, court records show.  \"He (Solis) ... probably knew he was going to go back to jail and did not want to go back to jail,\" sheriff's Maj. Mike Lee said Friday, according to CNN affiliate KTRK, when asked about a possible motive. It wasn't immediately clear what, if anything, Dhaliwal knew about the warrant. Solis is charged with capital murder. A judge ordered Solis held without bond at a probable cause hearing Saturday morning. His next court appearance is scheduled for Monday. A woman who was in the vehicle with Solis was also taken into custody. It wasn't immediately clear if she was facing charges. Dhaliwal was known in the community, and his death has spurred impromptu memorials as well as online tributes from people recalling their encounters with him. \"This guy had a heart of gold,\" Adrian Garcia, Harris County police commissioner, said. \"He treated his brothers and sisters in law enforcement as if they were just brothers and sisters. He thought of them before he thought of himself. He thought of the broader community before he thought of himself.\" A funeral for Dhaliwal is scheduled for Wednesday. A Sikh religious ceremony will take place at 10:30 a.m. local time and a law enforcement ceremony will take place at 11:30 a.m., according to a tweet from the Harris County Sheriff's Office. The public is welcome to attend both ceremonies, it said. Deputy's dashcam helped identify his alleged killer, authorities say Dhaliwal's dashcam helped identify Solis as his alleged killer, investigators say. The deadly encounter started as a regular traffic stop just before 12:30 p.m. CT in the Copper Brook area of northwestern Harris County, said Lee, the Harris County sheriff's major. The dashcam video shows Dhaliwal speaking with the driver with \"no combat, no arguing,\" Lee told reporters. The driver's door was open at one point as the deputy and driver were talking.  Dhaliwal shut the driver's door as the driver remained in the vehicle. As he turned to walk back to his patrol car, the driver's side door opened and a man exited the vehicle \"almost immediately running with a gun already out,\" Lee said.  The dashcam captured the fatal moment Dhaliwal was shot from behind in the back of the head, Lee said.  \"In a cold-blooded manner, ambush style, (he) shot Deputy Dhaliwal from behind,\" Gonzalez said. \"It's the worst day, the worst nightmare for any police executive.\"  The shooter returned to his vehicle and drove away. A resident who was doing yard work nearby heard the gunshots and rushed to help the deputy.  Authorities identified Solis by looking at Dhaliwal's dashcam video. They took a photo of the suspect from the dashcam and immediately got it out, Gonzalez said. Solis was arrested at an ice cream shop less than a mile from the shooting scene, authorities said. Solis had been there for nearly half an hour before he was taken into custody, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. The pistol deputies believe was used to kill Dhaliwal has been recovered, the sheriff said. Solis has been ordered to undergo a mental evaluation Solis shot Dhaliwal \"in the back of the head as he was walking away,\" in a \"cold and cowardly manner,\" a prosecutor wrote in a court filing arguing for no bond. Solis has been ordered to undergo a mental evaluation, court records show.   In 2002, he had been sentenced to 20 years in prison after his kidnapping and assault convictions. He was released in 2014, and was to remain on parole until 2022, according to the Texas Department of Public Saety.  The deputy leaves a legacy as a trailblazer  Dhaliwal is survived by his wife and three children.  He leaves a legacy as a trailblazer for the department he served for a decade. He was the first member of the Sikh community to become a Harris County sheriff's deputy, officials said.  In 2015, roughly six years after Dhaliwal joined, the sheriff's office made an official policy that allowed him to wear his beard and turban on duty, according to CNN affiliate KTRK. \"As a Sikh American, I felt the need to represent the Sikh community in law enforcement,\" Dhaliwal said at the time. \"It will give me the chance to open up the conversation.\" Prior to becoming a deputy, Dhaliwal was an entrepreneur with a trucking business. He found out that the Harris County Sheriff's Office needed someone like him to build bridges with the Sikh community and sold his business. He took lower pay as a detention officer and worked his way up to be a deputy, Garcia said.  Dhaliwal represented the community's diversity and inclusiveness, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner tweeted.  \"He wore the turban, he represented his community with integrity, respect and pride and he was respected by all,\" Gonzalez said. Sikhism is the world's fifth most popular religion. It is a monotheistic faith that believes in equality and service to others.  There are 25 million Sikhs around the world and about 500,000 in the United States, according to The Sikh Coalition.  A community mourns In the hours after Dhaliwal's death, residents of the community he served gathered in an impromptu vigil and used social media to honor him. Online, people shared photos and videos of their encounters with him. One woman sent the sheriff's office a video of Dhaliwal interacting with her deaf son at a restaurant. \"He laughed and joked with all of us and left a bright impression on my son who is deaf,\" she said, according to the sheriff's office, which tweeted the video.  People gathered Friday night at an outdoor, community-led candlelight vigil in the Copper Brook area, near where the shooting happened.

He was jovial, kind, a trailblazer for his faith and a beacon for his community.  \"He laughed and joked with all of us, and left a bright impression on my son who is deaf,\" a message to the Harris County Sheriff's Office from a resident said.  Nearly five years ago, Dhaliwal became the first deputy in his department to wear a turban and beard while in his police uniform, proudly representing his Sikh religion -- which preaches equality and service to others.  This week, Dhaliwal was gunned down in midday during a traffic stop, in \"a cold-blooded manner, ambush style,\" Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said in a press conference. A 47-year-old man has been charged with capital murder in connection to the deputy's killing, the sheriff's office said. In the hours since his death, the community that loved and admired the 10-year-veteran of the sheriff's office has gathered in impromptu vigils and used social media to honor who Dhaliwal was.  \"He was a bold and groundbreaking law enforcement officer in the eyes of our county, our state, our nation, and around the world, because he sought and received a permission to patrol while wearing the outward signs of his Sikh faith, including a turban and beard,\" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said in a statement Friday night.  He was loved by the Sikh community In 2015, the sheriff's office made their decision official to allow Dhaliwal to wear a dastaar and beard with his uniform, CNN affiliate KTRK reported.  \"Sandeep has been everything we've asked of a public servant,\" then-sheriff Adrian Garcia had said. \"He's been a servant leader and my commitment to the community was that we'd make sure that tokenism or window dressing wouldn't be how we count change, but rather that we'd make a meaningful difference.\" The deputy said he \"felt the need to represent the Sikh community in law enforcement.\" The religion is the fifth largest in the world, officials have told CNN. There are more than 25 million Sikhs around the world and about 500,000 in the US, according to The Sikh Coalition. In the hours since his death, the deputy was described as a trailblazer multiple times.  The mayor called Dhaliwal a \"walking lesson in tolerance and understanding, which are values Houstonians uphold here in the nation's most diverse city.\" \"The whole community is under the shock even now,\" said Harjit Singh Galhotra, a member of the Sikh National Center near Jersey Village where Dhaliwal worshiped. \"Some people don't want to even believe that this happened,\" he told CNN affiliate KPRC. \"He was very dear with all the people and he had a lot of friends in this community. We're going to miss him really bad.\"  Another member of the center told the affiliate Dhaliwal was an \"essential element\" of their community.  The deputy's funeral will be held within three days of his death, as is Sikh tradition, the affiliate reported.  He dedicated his life to service There are \"simply no words to adequately express our heartbreak, our sadness at this time,\" sheriff Gonzalez said Friday.  The deputy had a \"heart of gold,\" former sheriff and now Harris County police commissioner Garcia said. \"He treated his brothers and sisters in law enforcement as if they were just brothers and sisters. He thought of them before he thought of himself.\"  \"He thought of the broader community before he thought of himself.\" When Dhaliwal wasn't serving with the force, he was always finding more ways to help his community. In the days following Hurricane Harvey, which devastated Houston in 2017, Dhaliwal organized people to help from California, sheriff Gonzalez said, according to KTRK. The deputy had so many people and supplies lined up, they needed an 18-wheeler to bring them into Houston, Gonzalez said.  And after Hurricane Maria tore apart Puerto Rico, Dhaliwal and Garcia went to the island to help in any way they could, the affiliate reported. He grieved a fellow officer just 4 years ago Dhaliwal was the one consoling his community just a few years back, when a fellow officer, Deputy Darren Goforth, was killed in northwest Harris County.  \"He's one of the reasons I am in uniform today,\" Dhaliwal had said, according to KTRK. He was the one back then telling the community how to stand strong and support each other.  \"Just wear blue,\" the deputy had said. \"Wear blue and be proud of that. And that shows support to law enforcement. Simple as that.\" This time, the people who gathered at a community-led candlelight vigil Friday night were there to honor him.  Dhaliwal leaves behind his wife and three children.

The shooter, described as a Hispanic male, was found at a business less than a mile away from where the shooting took place, Lee said. A woman, who deputies said was also in the vehicle, was also taken into custody, Lee said.

She was not there, but her sister, Katie Stay, and her family were. Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys, ages 13 and 4, and two girls, ages 9 and 7, were killed when Haskell opened fire, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said. Only one member of the family, then 15-year-old Cassidy Stay, survived.  Authorities at the time indicated she was critically wounded, though she later made a full recovery. Jurors on Thursday unanimously rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's insanity defense.  The jury was dismissed until Monday for sentencing.

(You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. President Trump and Ukraine Looks like today might be a carbon copy of yesterday, with big, important news coming fast and furious. The whistleblower's complaint about President Trump's communications with Ukraine has been declassified and could be released as soon as this morning, three sources told CNN. The whistleblower has also tentatively agreed to meet with congressional lawmakers.\u00a0Later today, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is due to testify before Congress about the complaint. Maguire reportedly threatened to resign if the White House tried to restrict his testimony, according to The Washington Post. The White House yesterday released a rough transcript of a July 25 phone call that shows the President repeatedly pressed the leader of Ukraine to investigate Trump's possible 2020 rival, Joe Biden, and Biden's son. Democrats say the call is disturbing and have launched an impeachment inquiry related to it. The President says this is just another Democratic witch hunt. Here's everything we know so far about this fast-moving story. 2. Israel election\u00a0\u00a0 Benjamin Netanyahu's getting the first crack at forming a new government in Israel. After Netanyahu (the country's Prime Minister)\u00a0and Benny Gantz (the leader of the Blue and White party)\u00a0couldn't agree on a unity coalition, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin gave his Prime Minister four weeks to try to put a government together. That's a tall order because Netanyahu's Likud party actually ended up with fewer seats after Israel's second election of the year. Rivlin urged Netanyahu and all potential coalition allies to come to some kind of an agreement,\u00a0saying the country \"does not want more elections.\" 3. Vaping Eleven people have died nationwide from vaping-related illnesses. The latest two deaths happened in the South -- in Georgia and Florida.\u00a0As of last week, at least 530 cases of lung injury associated with the use of e-cigarettes or vaping products have been reported to the CDC. Growing concern\u00a0about the risks of vaping is forcing the federal government to take action, with the acting FDA chief saying that a new policy on e-cigarettes is coming out soon. Meanwhile,  the CEO of e-cig maker Juul is out and the company has stopped all advertising. 4. Wrong apartment murder trial A Texas Ranger says the ex-Dallas cop who killed a man in his own apartment was reasonable to think he was burglar. But the jury's not going to hear that. The judge in the trial won't let the Texas Ranger deliver that testimony to jurors to speak to the reasonableness of Amber Guyger's actions on the night of the shooting. Guyger is accused of murdering\u00a0accountant Botham Jean last year. Her defense team said she simply walked into the wrong apartment and shot Jean, thinking he was a burglar in her apartment. 5. Louisville police The police department in Louisville, Kentucky, faces a trio of lawsuits, which all allege that police there use traffic stops as a pretext to pull over black drivers and conduct \"racially biased\" unconstitutional searches and seizures. Two of the lawsuits say the police department included\u00a0the traffic stops as part of a program to stop violent crime\u00a0but that officers ended up targeting African-Americans in specific neighborhoods. The department told CNN it doesn't comment on pending litigation. THIS JUST IN ...

(You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Impeachment inquiry The notion\u00a0that has floated around some Democratic circles since the day Donald Trump was inaugurated, through months of Mueller report drama and endless cycles of controversy, was brought to light yesterday when Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House will open a formal impeachment inquiry into the President's conduct. The move was made after Trump admitted to withholding aid to Ukraine before a scheduled call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In that call, Trump pushed\u00a0Zelensky to look into dealings involving the son of his possible 2020 rival, Joe Biden. Trump insists the two things aren't related, and the White House as soon as today is expected to release a\u00a0transcript of the Zelensky call and a whistleblower's report related to it.\u00a0 So, what happens now? Usually the inquiry would go to a full House vote, but Pelosi has told the six House committees already investigating Trump to proceed \"under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.\" They will decide whether the President has committed any \"impeachable offenses,\" defined as \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" That could mean a whole lot of things, or nothing at all, so expect this part to be extremely contentious. Any articles of impeachment would be subject to a House vote\u00a0followed by a Senate trial. Ultimately, there's a whole ocean between impeachment and removal from office, especially since Republicans control\u00a0the Senate.\u00a0In opening this chapter, Pelosi said: \"The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\" Oh, and on top of it all, Zelensky and Trump are scheduled to have their first face-to-face meeting today on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. There could certainly be a lot to talk about.\u00a0 2. Climate crisis Before the impeachment news rocked the political sphere, President Trump singled out a very different adversary: Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. After the 16-year-old's fiery speech Monday at the UN, Trump responded to a video of her with a seemingly mocking message:\u00a0\"She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\" Thunberg ended up using his words in her Twitter bio. Meanwhile, Fox News apologized to the teen after conservative pundit Michael Knowles called Thunberg \"a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left.\"\u00a0The show's other guest and host both admonished Knowles on air. Thunberg has Asperger's and has said her diagnosis is a \"superpower\" that helps her activism. 3. Zimbabwe Zimbabwe's water crisis just got more desperate. The\u00a0main water treatment plant in the capital city of Harare was shut down Monday, leaving 1 million people without tap water. Authorities are now scrambling to secure water purifying chemicals to keep up with the need for clean water, and people have resorted to digging makeshift wells on their property.\u00a0Zimbabwe was hit by a severe drought between October 2018 and May. Besides the water crisis, the\u00a0UN food agency says more than 2 million Zimbabweans face\u00a0starvation.\u00a0 4. Navy suicides\u00a0 The US Navy has confirmed\u00a0that three sailors assigned to the USS George H. W. Bush aircraft carrier off the coast of Virginia died by suicide in \"separate incidents\" last week and has launched an investigation into their deaths. None of the deaths seem to be related, and the sailors all worked in different departments. Five sailors who were assigned to the carrier have died by suicide in the last two years.\u00a0The Marine Corps and the Navy have been dealing with a spike in suicides recently. The number of confirmed and suspected suicides among the active duty ranks of the two branches reached a 10-year high in 2018. After last week's deaths, Capt.\u00a0Sean Bailey, commanding officer of the USS George H. W. Bush, called for the naval community to come together \"to grieve, to support each other, and to care for those in need.\" 5. Pl\u00e1cido Domingo Opera legend\u00a0Pl\u00e1cido Domingo has severed his artistic relationship with The Metropolitan Opera in New York after a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him. According to the Met, the decision, which ends a\u00a050-year professional relationship, was mutual.\u00a0Domingo's image was removed yesterday from the \"Macbeth\" page on the Met Opera's official website. The show\u00a0was set to open today, with Domingo in the lead role.\u00a0In August, the Associated Press reported that nine women detailed alleged incidents of sexual harassment spanning three decades beginning in the late 1980s. In September, 11 more people came forward with allegations that included verbal harassment and groping.

(You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. President Trump Are the Democrats inching closer to impeaching President Trump after the whistleblower complaint controversy? Yesterday, after Trump acknowledged he\u00a0talked about Joe Biden during a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky,\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned the administration things might be heading\u00a0\"into a whole new stage of investigation.\" CNN has previously reported that Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son Hunter\u00a0and his links to a gas company. This took place as US military aid to Ukraine was hanging in the balance, leading some Democrats to accuse the President of abusing his power. 2. United Nations The annual United Nations General Assembly kicks off today in New York, with more than 90 heads of state gathering at UN headquarters for a week's worth of meetings. The assembly's first big event is the Climate Action summit, where\u00a0UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has asked leaders to offer \"concrete and transformative plans\" to fight the climate crisis. President Trump won't be there, though. He's skipping the climate summit to host a session on religious persecution. Tomorrow, the parade of speeches by world leaders begins, starting with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Trump is scheduled to speak tomorrow as well. Everyone will be watching as well to see whether Trump meets with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, after tensions between the two countries flared up after the attack on the oil fields in Saudi Arabia. 3. Travelers stranded About 600,000 travelers are stranded around the world after British tour operator Thomas Cook collapsed last night. The 178-year-old company entered liquidation after talks on a financial rescue failed, so\u00a0all flights and vacations booked through it have been canceled.\u00a0With so many people stranded, the British government is working to bring many of them home to the UK, in what's being called the largest peacetime repatriation in the country's history. Click here for the latest updates. 4. Weather There's a new tropical storm in the Atlantic. Tropical Storm Karen formed over the weekend, sparking tropical storm warnings for Saint Vincent, the Grenadines, and Grenada and its territories. Tropical storm watches have been issued for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Karen is moving across the eastern Caribbean in a west-northwest direction and could \"pass near or over\" Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands tomorrow as a tropical storm. 5. Emmy Awards Some \"Game of Thrones\" fans were disappointed with the fantasy show's final season, but apparently Emmy voters weren't. \"Thrones\" capped off its epic run last night\u00a0by winning its fourth Emmy for best drama series. The show won 59 Emmys during its eight seasons. The Amazon series \"Fleabag\" was a major upset winner for best comedy, and the show's star, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, also took home acting and writing honors. \"Pose\" star Billy Porter made history,\u00a0becoming\u00a0the first\u00a0openly gay black man to win the lead actor in a drama series Emmy, and there were several speeches citing LGBTQ and women's rights. Click here to see the complete list of winners and (of course) the red carpet fashions.

Now there's more debate after the NFL Network named it the top play in the 100 years of the league. \"The Catch,\" a game-winning pass from Joe Montana to Dwight Clark from the NFC Championship game in January 1982, was the No. 2 play as voted on by panel of national media members. In 1972, there was debate about whether another Steeler had touched the ball and whether Harris' catch was legal. Now there is debate about whether other plays are more deserving for the top spot.  \"It's been 46 years since the Immaculate Reception, but the play still amazes me like it did when I was a kid. Where did Franco Harris come from? Thanks for letting me help with #NFL100, @NFL,\" Dr. Mehmet Oz tweeted. Many fans tweeted the honor should have gone to the \"Helmet Catch\" in the late stages of Super Bowl XLII by the New York Giants' David Tyree. Tyree and a New England Patriots defender battled for the ball with Tyree pinning it to his helmet to secure a drive-sustaining reception. It was voted the No. 3 play. Twitter user Taylor Zahralban stated the case for the \"Helmet Catch,\" saying Tyree was a backup wide receiver who made the catch against a standout defensive back who had him covered well.  And all that after quarterback Eli Manning was almost sacked several times before he heaved the ball downfield. The Giants went on to defeat the unbeaten Patriots, considered one of the best NFL teams ever. Did he think fluke play of a deflected pass was better? \"Come on, man,\" Zahralban wrote. The \"Immaculate Reception\" gave the Steelers their first postseason win in 25 years, and two years later Pittsburgh won the first of six Super Bowls. It came on a fourth-and-10 play. There were 22 seconds remaining when the ball was snapped.  Harris, who won four of those NFL titles, tweeted: \"Reliving this moment is still exciting for me. What an honor to be chosen the #1 play in NFL history! Sharing this with my teammates and football fans everywhere makes it even better.\" After the game, Harris told reporters he saw the ball bounce off Raiders' defensive back Jack Tatum. (Tatum said it was off Steelers fullback Frenchy Fuqua). \"And I just looked up and I just put my hands out and, you know, I guess my hands were in the right place,\" he said.  There were no convincing replays to determine who the ball was deflected by or whether the ball hit the turf. A Raiders player who went to tackle Harris complained that he was blocked illegally.

Of the more than 46,000 people helped to date through using CrowdSource Rescue, 370 were in southeastern Texas this past week after Imelda -- a tropical storm that weakened to a tropical depression -- thrashed the area, according to founder Matthew Marchetti, 29. The free website works by connecting professional first-responders and vetted volunteers with people in need before, during and after a disaster using GPS tracking and mapping technology, according to CrowdSource Rescue's website. These connections are facilitated through a website where people can request help or offer to volunteer.  \"It was built by Houstonians to help Houston,\" Marchetti told CNN. \"So when another storm threatens Houston or its neighbors, it's obviously a bit personal. It has been a sight to behold, watching Houstonians quickly snap back in to the attitudes of Harvey, asking, 'How can I help someone?' and coming together to help others. There is a resiliency and helpfulness in this city, that is worth bragging to high heavens about.\" To date, CrowdSource Rescue has been used during 14 incidents around the US and registered more than 18,000 rescuers and volunteers, according to its website. Many of those volunteers responded this week to Imelda, a slow moving storm that lingered over Harris and Jefferson County. Flooding on Thursday left Houston neighborhoods in several feet of water, forcing authorities to perform more than 400 high-water rescues, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said. There were 323 stranded vehicles and 22 major accidents. There have been at least two storm-related deaths, according to law enforcement officials. Raul Eliseo Rivas-Hernandez, 56, was pulled Thursday evening from a van submerged in floodwater; he died after being taken to a hospital. In Jefferson County, 19-year-old Hunter Morrison died when he drowned after being electrocuted while trying to move his horse. Late Thursday night, Marchetti could be found driving toward Beaumont to perform some rescues in a 15-foot tall Chevy 4500 pickup truck. The $140,000 truck was on loan from Houston lawyer and mayoral candidate Tony Buzbee who has let CrowdSource Rescue use the Chevy three times. Lifted trucks like this were a fixture during Hurricane Harvey. \"We have a massive drainage problem in Houston. I reached out to Matthew after hearing how his group organizes volunteer efforts in a very efficient way,\" Buzbee told CNN. \"When I'm driving down the freeway, instead of 18-wheeler drivers looking down at me, we're at the same level. This truck was built for work.\" CrowdSource Rescue is mostly funded through donations. The group recently partnered with Axelrad, a Houston bar, which provided the organization a warehouse it's turning into a disaster response headquarters.", "sourceId": "article_CA2116D6-4F43-E4D0-A4E1-5469430B35A7", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/21/us/crowdsource-rescue-texas-imelda/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-09-21T18:03:19Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-09-21T18:03:19Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-09-21T18:03:19Z", "path": "/2019/09/21/us/crowdsource-rescue-texas-imelda", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Fernando Alfonso III, CNN", "contributors": ["Fernando Alfonso III"], "headline": "How a crowdsourcing website helped rescue 370 people during Tropical Storm Imelda", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190921115907-01-crowdsource-rescue-texas-imelda-story-body.jpg", "tags": [{"id": "ebe63711-0348-4c45-8c98-12d453234b73"}, {"id": "a80d39fe-1b71-459f-bd36-f8a4f72b8290"}, {"id": "40acf5f7-7996-4d60-bad2-489ef77cddf4"}, {"id": "bab9050e-c88a-46c8-b005-0bde4af67ea5"}, {"id": "553a1a18-00c8-4bb0-9008-213e78179a98"}, {"id": "f6e26bc9-c50a-4e23-a6ce-bf9a4e4a9504"}, {"id": "0c1f8ef8-478e-46ff-ae98-03c06daff7ee"}, {"id": "7bedae2a-c982-49bf-8ca6-3a2a0de9ef35"}, {"id": "ef33282f-9024-4dbf-9e08-3b6233995785"}, {"id": "093141c3-cad9-4111-831f-9098d289e88d"}, {"id": "ffed5327-f7f4-41ba-b6a0-bae9f1fd23c5"}, {"id": "c00faf66-f3e1-4c3e-88eb-da2b862230e6"}, {"id": "bbeba556-f98f-4db4-bbee-d73b417eb1c3"}, {"id": "4ecf4d52-746f-4c9a-b33e-78e910d98495"}, {"id": "00aa2b83-db83-411e-a580-14bfcc6824f7"}, {"id": "7293d40c-66f5-5061-8948-f207c942277d"}, {"id": "7293d40c-66f5-5061-8948-f207c942277d"}, {"id": "b5614d46-52cd-5543-b861-ebb8e317d371"}, {"id": "f6a88258-a64e-4d46-93dc-9a03e48ac594"}, {"id": "f6a88258-a64e-4d46-93dc-9a03e48ac594"}, {"id": "3c59859b-6fbe-42c3-995a-521881be67cd"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "2a1fbdb6-333a-4b46-9ec8-29ca034d21ad"}, {"id": "28d880a2-7751-4914-8fc2-ea71eb30debc"}, {"id": "be6998eb-1fb8-4c65-aac9-5fc54bac30a5"}, {"id": "c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d"}, {"id": "3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "b852b5d8-31c6-49e9-8ff1-986a55356fa1"}, {"id": "c7397a5d-786c-44de-a59d-1c9cd6e9cf03"}, {"id": "3c4b8156-ac6f-48c2-90c8-bc18e0e184b9"}, {"id": "15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158"}, {"id": "7bacc4f5-0758-4abd-a57e-c3633bd0f1aa"}, {"id": "3f9c3ae3-f072-4733-ad97-4748ce5e9bba"}, {"id": "b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c"}, {"id": "ba149945-03c8-4584-83c3-13dd4e4b89cd"}, {"id": "c8456516-b9be-42bc-ac2f-c96364001bee"}, {"id": "aa67276b-8530-439b-914f-1be2979f9bc7"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "f5ccd314-0f61-5864-8b2e-555af1905b3c"}, {"id": "3b401dcb-9964-5e73-8d3e-8d6c2c48a288"}, {"id": "11c523af-1abf-53de-9e0b-87db225b1e68"}, {"id": "f16b72d7-1fcb-5ab1-9804-ad08747d40b9"}, {"id": "b364aade-6961-4324-8099-e759ff4e9e5d"}, {"id": "9c5826c0-329c-54ce-b065-3826ae02b3ab"}, {"id": "2e7fe0c6-9286-5952-ae61-15445e10a091"}, {"id": "c63da53d-e2b5-5514-979f-257a6ac91c96"}, {"id": "3c24b902-a35b-5fe5-b8ab-d2c983192cb6"}, {"id": "a7dc7f2e-f980-5b00-b8cc-1356195e7b69"}, {"id": "9b9aed9f-e3a5-479a-81e5-600f0b0cb607"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "tickers": []}, {"_id": "h_831f0a9aae0cd2bb9374ba04a4acdfd4", "type": "article", "body": "The weakening remnants of Imelda will make their way Friday into northern Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana as misery lingers in Houston, even as floodwaters start to recede. Flooding on Thursday left some Houston neighborhoods swimming in several feet of water, forcing authorities to perform more than 400 high-water rescues, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said. There were 323 stranded vehicles and 22 major accidents, it said. The chaos continued early Friday, when officials got a report that nine barges broke away from their moorings on the San Jacinto River, the US Coast Guard said. At least one barge struck the westbound bridge along Interstate 10, Texas Department of Transportation spokesman Danny Perez said.  Officials are assessing the eastbound bridge for damage, with a full assessment planned when water level recede, Perez said.  Both bridges were closed to traffic Friday morning, and vessel movement beneath them remained suspended following strong currents Thursday evening, Perez said.  By Friday evening, at least two of the barges were lodged underneath the bridge and one was breached in the mud north of the bridge, the Coast Guard said. The other six had been corralled.  The barges contained soybean oil, lube oil, naphtha and monoethylene glycol, the Coast Guard said. There had been no reports of pollution and there was no health threat to the public.  There have been at least two storm-related deaths, officials said. Raul Eliseo Rivas-Hernandez, 56, was pulled Thursday evening from a van submerged in floodwater, Harris County officials said. The man died after being taken to a hospital.  And in Jefferson County, 19-year-old Hunter Morrison died when he was electrocuted, then drowned, while trying to move his horse, according to a statement from his family posted at the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office's Facebook page. Imelda -- the seventh wettest tropical cyclone in US history, per the National Weather Service -- dumped more than 15 inches of rain across Harris County. Some areas in neighboring Jefferson County saw a whopping 43 inches of rain.  Parts of southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana remain under flash flood watches, the National Weather Service said Friday morning.  Parts of Arkansas will also see periods of heavy rain throughout Friday, with rainfall totals reaching up to 4 inches in some areas, CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said. Neighbors rescue neighbors More than 200 vehicles had been towed in Houston by Thursday night, as floodwaters began to recede, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said.  Residents began ditching their cars after heavy flooding made the roadways impassable.  In Beaumont, a city in Jefferson County, neighborhoods turned into lakes and roads looked more like streams. Two overnight shelters were opened, CNN affiliate KPRC reported.  Some neighbors helped each other, with one resident telling the station, \"We're just trying to take care of our people.\" Floodwater poured Thursday morning into Beaumont TV station KBMT, forcing the news staff to move to Houston sister station KHOU to broadcast. Officials urged residents to get to safety.  \"If you are still in an area with standing water, seek higher ground and shelter in place,\" Beaumont police said. \"Be patients and only call 911 for emergencies.\"  Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott declared a state of disaster Thursday for 13 counties. Comparing Imelda to Harvey Many southeast Texas residents say the storm was similar --- and some said worse -- than Hurricane Harvey. The Category 4 monster made landfall two years ago in Texas and Louisiana.  That storm broke the US record for rainfall from a single storm, dumping more than 60 inches about 90 miles east of Houston. Harvey left the state in devastation with up to $75 billion in damages.  \"I'm tired of it,\" Kingwood-area resident Sharai Poteet told CNN affiliate KTRK.  Poteet spent more than $50,000 repairing her home after Harvey, she said, after that storm dropped 27 trillion gallons of water on Texas and Louisiana.  \"I don't understand why we don't have any drainage out here anymore,\" she said this week. Misty Walton's apartment in Vidor, Texas, was inundated with water as remnants from Imelda moved through state.  \"Harvey was bad, and this is bad, too,\" Walton said. \"People are not even done rebuilding here, and it's happening again.\" Her apartment and two cars in the driveway were flooded, she said.  \"I don't know what we're going to do,\" Walton said. \"But like always, we pull together, and we find a way.\"", "sourceId": "article_308DBEF0-1ABF-8731-BDBB-4CB307056862", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/20/weather/imelda-flooding-friday-wxc/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-09-20T07:25:24Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-09-21T02:55:22Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-09-21T02:55:22Z", "path": "/2019/09/20/weather/imelda-flooding-friday-wxc", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Christina Maxouris and Dakin Andone, CNN", "contributors": ["Christina Maxouris", "Dakin Andone"], "headline": "Barges break loose and strike a bridge near Houston after Imelda forces 400 water rescues and strands 300 drivers", "section": "weather", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190920033119-daily-weather-forecast-houston-texas-flooding-severe-storms-00000318-story-body.jpg", "tags": [{"id": "ebe63711-0348-4c45-8c98-12d453234b73"}, {"id": "40acf5f7-7996-4d60-bad2-489ef77cddf4"}, {"id": "e5e83791-634e-45a8-a5ae-6566f72ea74d"}, {"id": "f6e26bc9-c50a-4e23-a6ce-bf9a4e4a9504"}, {"id": "ffed5327-f7f4-41ba-b6a0-bae9f1fd23c5"}, {"id": "bbeba556-f98f-4db4-bbee-d73b417eb1c3"}, {"id": "e3f10b40-bc52-4095-823d-7a2e66d91ddb"}, {"id": "3f9c3ae3-f072-4733-ad97-4748ce5e9bba"}, {"id": "f5ccd314-0f61-5864-8b2e-555af1905b3c"}, {"id": "76ef37e9-9c38-58c3-939f-01d4a4ecc224"}, {"id": "0a753984-50a3-59af-bccc-e5014045e614"}, {"id": "7293d40c-66f5-5061-8948-f207c942277d"}, {"id": "7293d40c-66f5-5061-8948-f207c942277d"}, {"id": "a3444baa-385d-5874-8582-f7a984c1864c"}, {"id": "a7dc7f2e-f980-5b00-b8cc-1356195e7b69"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "2a1fbdb6-333a-4b46-9ec8-29ca034d21ad"}, {"id": "28d880a2-7751-4914-8fc2-ea71eb30debc"}, {"id": "c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d"}, {"id": "3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "b852b5d8-31c6-49e9-8ff1-986a55356fa1"}, {"id": "15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158"}, {"id": "7bacc4f5-0758-4abd-a57e-c3633bd0f1aa"}, {"id": "fff9d467-32d7-4e5c-b07d-fbea99b5b2c3"}, {"id": "b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c"}, {"id": "ba149945-03c8-4584-83c3-13dd4e4b89cd"}, {"id": "c8456516-b9be-42bc-ac2f-c96364001bee"}, {"id": "aa67276b-8530-439b-914f-1be2979f9bc7"}, {"id": "cd86b20b-6403-4e78-b813-1bb72ae1e550"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "4ccf7de0-5c99-5e8e-95dd-54ef32c131a0"}, {"id": "b5614d46-52cd-5543-b861-ebb8e317d371"}, {"id": "f16b72d7-1fcb-5ab1-9804-ad08747d40b9"}, {"id": "d0e19a14-b34a-5f5f-9ad3-2e7acd2fb03f"}, {"id": "f6a88258-a64e-4d46-93dc-9a03e48ac594"}, {"id": "c37ccef8-d48a-5642-80dc-37bfb736cafd"}, {"id": "c63da53d-e2b5-5514-979f-257a6ac91c96"}, {"id": "edbe1e5e-ef24-4ab9-bfd1-b29c17df9f6f"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "tickers": []}, {"_id": "h_b742a0b57c811cb891c31168a13d14bf", "type": "article", "body": "Emergency responders across southeast Texas are scrambling to help people who've been stranded or displaced by flooding from Imelda. The tropical system swamped whole neighborhoods, with reports of more than 40 inches of rain in some places. The Houston Fire Department was dispatched to nearly 2,000 emergency incidents and performed 142 high water rescues Friday between midnight and 2:45 a.m., the agency tweeted. More than 400 high-water rescues had been performed Thursday by the Harris County Sheriff's Office, that agency said. First responders weren't the only ones helping. Ordinary people also were doing what they could for their flooded neighbors. Edward and Maya Gonzalez saw people struggling to get horses out of floodwaters in Spring, Texas, they posted on Twitter. One man was swept by the current into some bushes. Two people swam out to help him while others got the horses to safety. Furniture store owner Jim McIngvale, known locally as \"Mattress Mack,\" on Thursday turned one of his Gallery Furniture stores into a shelter. \"We are open as a shelter and you can sleep here and you can eat here. Stay as long you need,\" he said in a Facebook Live video.  Pets would be welcome, too, he said. McIngvale also opened one his stores in 2017 to people displaced by Hurricane Harvey and donated furniture to people who lost their homes. \"We'll take care of you because Texas always takes care of us,\" he said Thursday. Churches, schools and community buildings have also opened as shelters, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. Rapper Trae tha Truth, DJ Mr. Rogers and members of his Relief Gang were out Thursday in trucks to pick up people stranded by the storm. Trae tha Truth urged others with trucks that could handle the water to join the effort. \"We've taken people out of their homes, from pregnant women from their homes to vehicles that stranded,\" he told CNN affiliate KRTK. \"A lot of times, If we see people actually trying to move through the water, whether they may be walking or they have their kids, we will transport them to where they need to go. So, we're doing a little bit of everything.\"  He does a lot of charity work in Houston and helped rescue people during Harvey, as well.  \"It's just been a lot of people in need,\" he said. \"I think it was kind of unexpected of how serious it was going to be.\"", "sourceId": "article_C6114A11-8294-A55A-144B-4EA307BFC683", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/20/us/texas-imelda-helping-trnd/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-09-20T16:25:51Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-09-20T16:25:51Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-09-20T16:25:51Z", "path": "/2019/09/20/us/texas-imelda-helping-trnd", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By David Williams, CNN", "contributors": ["David Williams"], "headline": "Here are the ways, big and small, that people are helping Texas flood victims", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190919130144-flooding-texas-imelda-story-body.jpg", "tags": [{"id": "ebe63711-0348-4c45-8c98-12d453234b73"}, {"id": "0a753984-50a3-59af-bccc-e5014045e614"}, {"id": "e5e83791-634e-45a8-a5ae-6566f72ea74d"}, {"id": "7293d40c-66f5-5061-8948-f207c942277d"}, {"id": "7293d40c-66f5-5061-8948-f207c942277d"}, {"id": "f6e26bc9-c50a-4e23-a6ce-bf9a4e4a9504"}, {"id": "ffed5327-f7f4-41ba-b6a0-bae9f1fd23c5"}, {"id": "bbeba556-f98f-4db4-bbee-d73b417eb1c3"}, {"id": "3f9c3ae3-f072-4733-ad97-4748ce5e9bba"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "2a1fbdb6-333a-4b46-9ec8-29ca034d21ad"}, {"id": "28d880a2-7751-4914-8fc2-ea71eb30debc"}, {"id": "c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d"}, {"id": "3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "b852b5d8-31c6-49e9-8ff1-986a55356fa1"}, {"id": "15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158"}, {"id": "7bacc4f5-0758-4abd-a57e-c3633bd0f1aa"}, {"id": "b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c"}, {"id": "ba149945-03c8-4584-83c3-13dd4e4b89cd"}, {"id": "c8456516-b9be-42bc-ac2f-c96364001bee"}, {"id": "aa67276b-8530-439b-914f-1be2979f9bc7"}, {"id": "cd86b20b-6403-4e78-b813-1bb72ae1e550"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "f5ccd314-0f61-5864-8b2e-555af1905b3c"}, {"id": "b5614d46-52cd-5543-b861-ebb8e317d371"}, {"id": "f16b72d7-1fcb-5ab1-9804-ad08747d40b9"}, {"id": "f6a88258-a64e-4d46-93dc-9a03e48ac594"}, {"id": "a7dc7f2e-f980-5b00-b8cc-1356195e7b69"}, {"id": "edbe1e5e-ef24-4ab9-bfd1-b29c17df9f6f"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "tickers": []}, {"_id": "h_39a5af1fbf4ea1c99b1841222762c448", "type": "article", "body": "Billionaire Robert Smith has made good on his promise to pay off the student loan debt of the entire 2019 graduating class at Morehouse College by donating $34 million to the historically black men's school in Atlanta. In May, Smith stunned students, their parents and school officials when he announced his offer during commencement. His multimillion-dollar donation will be distributed through the school's new Student Success Program. In addition to paying off the debt of the 2019 graduates, this program will solicit and accept donations to help reduce or eliminate the student loan debt of other Morehouse students, school president David A. Thomas said. More than 400 graduates from Morehouse's Class of 2019, as well as their parents and guardians, will have their student loans paid thanks to Smith's gift, which spurred others to give, as well. The school wants to gauge the social impact of debt elimination What Smith did \"inspired other individuals to contact us to see if they could take part in the effort to reduce student debt,\" Thomas told CNN. \"Most of the people who were calling didn't have the kind of (money) that he had. So, we wondered what vehicle could we create\" to let others help \"in a way that's customized to their means.\" There's also a research component to the Student Success Program, which the school will use to track the social impact of student loan reduction or elimination. Members of the Class of 2019 who agree to participate will be studied to see how their lives change when their student loans are eliminated or significantly reduced. \"It's a great controlled experiment,\" Thomas said, noting that the lives and career choices of the Class of 2019 will be compared to the Class of 2018. A Morehouse student usually graduates with between $35,000 to $40,000 in loan debt, the school said in a press release. A stunning act of generosity The Morehouse seniors and their families were shocked when Smith made his announcement. \"We're looking at each other like, 'Is he being serious?' That's a lot of money,\" salutatorian Robert James said in May, after Smith spoke.  The announcement was met with a standing ovation and chants of \"MVP!\" In addition to putting, as Smith called it, \"a little fuel in (the graduates') bus,\" he expected the recipients of his generosity to use it to help others. \"Now, I know my class will make sure they pay this forward,\" he continued. \"I want my class to look at these (alumni) -- these beautiful Morehouse brothers -- and let's make sure every class has the same opportunity going forward, because we are enough to take care of our own community. We are enough to ensure we have all the opportunities of the American dream.\" Smith has done this before Smith, founder of the investment firm Vista Equity Partners, is worth about $5 billion, according to Forbes, which reports he is the richest black person in America. He was a chemical engineer for Goodyear and Kraft before attending business school. He worked for Goldman Sachs, specializing in technology investments, before starting Vista Equity in 2000. In 2016, Cornell University, one of his alma maters, renamed its chemical and biomolecular engineering school in honor of the Austin, Texas, investor after he committed $50 million to the school. He's also donated millions to cancer research and the arts. His Fund II Foundation provides grants under five pillars: preserving the African-American experience; safeguarding human rights; conserving the environment; providing music education; and sustaining \"critical American values such as entrepreneurialism,\" the organization says. In 2017, Smith signed the Giving Pledge, an effort spearheaded by billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates to convince wealthy Americans to give away half of their fortunes. So, will Morehouse's next commencement speaker feel any pressure to match Smith's generosity? \"I don't know who the next speaker will be,\" Thomas said, \"but I do know that it puts pressure on me to convince this person that they don't have to give $34 million to give this speech.\"", "sourceId": "article_D8EDE89E-BE86-CDE0-FBCE-4EBCBC579232", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/20/us/morehouse-student-debt-trnd/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-09-20T16:21:55Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-09-20T16:21:55Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-09-20T16:21:55Z", "path": "/2019/09/20/us/morehouse-student-debt-trnd", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Doug Criss, CNN", "contributors": ["Doug Criss"], "headline": "$34 million: How much one man is paying to wipe out a graduating class' college debt", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190519133009-03-robert-f-smith-morehouse-commencement-story-body.jpg", "tags": [{"id": "a80d39fe-1b71-459f-bd36-f8a4f72b8290"}, {"id": "4e5df5ef-553d-51f3-af75-629c881cc38c"}, {"id": "0c2fa19b-ed3f-576b-84cf-1ac4cd51c555"}, {"id": "55819a88-f48f-49ad-847f-d54fe1afa1ef"}, {"id": "85a05657-a89c-4edf-849c-0495c2d1f9ae"}, {"id": "e4fcd038-b942-42d8-83ca-196f124ca67e"}, {"id": "79c31015-bca0-413f-8b75-783b39c01385"}, {"id": "3e5aae2c-0dec-4f1e-b8e1-3923b12f4bca"}, {"id": "336947b7-6a0d-43b1-9ac2-90c451bf9535"}, {"id": "49a125fa-088a-401e-8ebe-0368a236c37e"}, {"id": "c00faf66-f3e1-4c3e-88eb-da2b862230e6"}, {"id": "cb94f5c0-de37-42d1-afea-8ed9aa6ba607"}, {"id": "84ae8c0b-bdec-47b2-8a5b-5636ec5bfa02"}, {"id": "d5ff3ee3-e522-44c4-b4d4-cd14a7dbd9c3"}, {"id": "0156f51c-0c01-5ad6-935b-852c861d6c2a"}, {"id": "98f7c017-c617-4ff4-900b-1d282502d448"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "2a1fbdb6-333a-4b46-9ec8-29ca034d21ad"}, {"id": "28d880a2-7751-4914-8fc2-ea71eb30debc"}, {"id": "be6998eb-1fb8-4c65-aac9-5fc54bac30a5"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "d1c54fd9-62b3-4e83-8415-f347fdcd805c"}, {"id": "e8030357-234d-4ee5-a29b-092ad7e8c04b"}, {"id": "bab9050e-c88a-46c8-b005-0bde4af67ea5"}, {"id": "5aa9e10b-1672-47d0-b9ad-68fb99bf3608"}, {"id": "3c4b8156-ac6f-48c2-90c8-bc18e0e184b9"}, {"id": "85186acd-6f35-432b-9fd7-5586c122151d"}, {"id": "3c8c3dba-643c-4981-a3f7-f69f48ebf257"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "82291b29-4e23-4924-a495-b225c537c80a"}, {"id": "032a4927-071e-55fd-8421-b38e5f3a87b5"}, {"id": "c63da53d-e2b5-5514-979f-257a6ac91c96"}, {"id": "aac2ed4f-8594-4761-a990-875dbd31aafb"}, {"id": "9b9aed9f-e3a5-479a-81e5-600f0b0cb607"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "tickers": []}, {"_id": "h_1e1a5f3a6ec99b801e088bdf6ef6731a", "type": "article", "tags": [{"id": "ebe63711-0348-4c45-8c98-12d453234b73"}, {"id": "eb2be9cf-376d-56ae-89cc-1abd6205f2a2"}, {"id": "40acf5f7-7996-4d60-bad2-489ef77cddf4"}, {"id": "e5e83791-634e-45a8-a5ae-6566f72ea74d"}, {"id": "f6e26bc9-c50a-4e23-a6ce-bf9a4e4a9504"}, {"id": "ffed5327-f7f4-41ba-b6a0-bae9f1fd23c5"}, {"id": "bbeba556-f98f-4db4-bbee-d73b417eb1c3"}, {"id": "3f9c3ae3-f072-4733-ad97-4748ce5e9bba"}, {"id": "f5ccd314-0f61-5864-8b2e-555af1905b3c"}, {"id": "0a753984-50a3-59af-bccc-e5014045e614"}, {"id": "7293d40c-66f5-5061-8948-f207c942277d"}, {"id": "7293d40c-66f5-5061-8948-f207c942277d"}, {"id": "7be8b102-4099-56ec-8dd5-b1f13ff5fd9b"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "2a1fbdb6-333a-4b46-9ec8-29ca034d21ad"}, {"id": "28d880a2-7751-4914-8fc2-ea71eb30debc"}, {"id": "c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d"}, {"id": "3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "b852b5d8-31c6-49e9-8ff1-986a55356fa1"}, {"id": "15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158"}, {"id": "7bacc4f5-0758-4abd-a57e-c3633bd0f1aa"}, {"id": "b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c"}, {"id": "ba149945-03c8-4584-83c3-13dd4e4b89cd"}, {"id": "c8456516-b9be-42bc-ac2f-c96364001bee"}, {"id": "aa67276b-8530-439b-914f-1be2979f9bc7"}, {"id": "cd86b20b-6403-4e78-b813-1bb72ae1e550"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "4ccf7de0-5c99-5e8e-95dd-54ef32c131a0"}, {"id": "b5614d46-52cd-5543-b861-ebb8e317d371"}, {"id": "f16b72d7-1fcb-5ab1-9804-ad08747d40b9"}, {"id": "d0e19a14-b34a-5f5f-9ad3-2e7acd2fb03f"}, {"id": "fefe60e6-ef3b-4d52-8e6f-21ce8ae3ff9c"}, {"id": "f6a88258-a64e-4d46-93dc-9a03e48ac594"}, {"id": "187d426e-c37f-4581-b79f-241b5b97961c"}, {"id": "c37ccef8-d48a-5642-80dc-37bfb736cafd"}, {"id": "c63da53d-e2b5-5514-979f-257a6ac91c96"}, {"id": "4cfaa94b-8587-42b8-978b-8826fc291114"}, {"id": "a7dc7f2e-f980-5b00-b8cc-1356195e7b69"}, {"id": "edbe1e5e-ef24-4ab9-bfd1-b29c17df9f6f"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "tickers": [], "body": "Hundreds of cars were left on Houston freeways Thursday as flooding made the highways and many other roads impassable. As officials watched waters recede late Thursday, tow truck drivers removed 200 of the vehicles that were in the roadways and waited to remove hundreds more, Police Chief Art Acevedo said. Many of the bayous or creeks were returning to normal, officials said at a nighttime news conference. The San Jacinto River wasn't and is expected to crest around 5 a.m. CT. \"Things are starting to improve,\" Mayor Sylvester Turner said. But there were concerns for neighborhoods along the river and near Lake Houston, where a torrent of rain fell as Imelda -- a tropical storm that weakened to a tropical depression -- passed over. At least one death is storm related, officials said. A man who was in a van that drove into deep water Thursday died.  He was in his 40s or 50s and was one of at least three people extracted from a submerged van, according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez. The driver of the van was approaching a freeway when he paused briefly, then drove into water that was 8 feet deep, causing the van to submerge, Gonzalez said.  The storm brought intense rain to southeastern Texas over three days. Some areas have received more than 30 inches, and one spot in Jefferson County got 43.15 inches, according to the National Weather Service office in Houston. Recent developments include: \u2022 The Harris County Sheriff's Office tweeted that it had received calls for 387 water rescues. \u2022 Flight arrivals at Houston Bush Airport will resume at 4 a.m. Friday, officials tweeted. One entrance to the airport is closed because of flooding. \u2022 The Houston city government will be open Friday, but area public schools will not be.  Desperation in Beaumont and elsewhere In the Beaumont area of Jefferson County, some neighborhoods looked like lakes Thursday. Video posted by state game wardens showed rescuers in an airboat, speeding down covered streets to surrounded homes. \"The situation here is turning worse by the minute,\" Michael Stephens, trapped by floodwaters at an apartment complex in the nearby city of Vidor, told CNN Thursday. \"People have snakes in their apartments from the creek. ... (We) also have elderly disabled people stuck in their apartments.\" LIVE UPDATES From inside, Stephens recorded video of people trudging through floodwater outside. He said for this area, the flooding seemed worse than he remembered from 2017's deadly Hurricane Harvey. In Beaumont, ankle-deep water had collected in the lobby of the Elegante Hotel, and more was coming in, video recorded by Lupe Torres on Thursday showed. Floodwater poured into Beaumont TV station KBMT Thursday morning, forcing the news staff to move to their sister station in Houston, KHOU, to broadcast. Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott declared a state of disaster Thursday for 13 counties. Drivers trapped on I-10 near Winnie In the community of Winnie -- between Houston and Beaumont -- floodwaters intruded onto Interstate 10 and surface streets Thursday morning, trapping motorists on the highway and surrounding businesses. A photo on social media showed a truck almost submerged near a hotel. Steve Castle told CNN floodwaters had him stuck in his truck on I-10 early Thursday. \"I was supposed to be driving back to Houston. I don't think I'm going anywhere soon,\" Castle said from his truck. In Chambers County, which includes Winnie, at least 200 homes were taking on water, Sheriff Brian Hawthorne said. The sheriff's office said it was reaching trapped people with high-water rescue vehicles and airboats.  High-water vehicles also were being used to evacuate several patients from the Winnie hospital, Constable Dennis Dugat told OnScene.TV. In Spring, north of Houston, Edward and his wife were returning home from after dropping their nephew at his house after school when they saw some ranchers, horses and passersby struggling in the floodwaters.  The couple pulled over and noticed everyone in the water was fighting to get the horses out, and in the process, one man was swept into the bushes by the current. Once the group was able to get the horses out safely, they went back in for the man and pulled him out as well. Both the horses and people were all rescued.  More rain to come Thursday The storm is in East Texas and slowly moving northeast. Flash flood watches are in effect Thursday more millions of people across East Texas and western Louisiana. In Louisiana, the storm could bring 3 to 5 more inches of rain -- with isolated amounts as high as 10 inches -- on Thursday, the National Weather Service said. Houston may receive more than 12 inches of rain before the storm is over, while suburbs will have received more. Comparing rainfall from Harvey and Imelda Imelda is causing some of the most serious flooding in southeastern Texas since Hurricane Harvey, which created major problems in August 2017. Generally, Harvey, which claimed dozens of lives and caused billions of dollars in damage, dropped more rain than Imelda.  Harvey broke the US record for rainfall from a single storm, dumping more than 60 inches about 90 miles east of Houston. Harvey left 34 inches of rain at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, and more than 40 inches in areas east of the city.", "sourceId": "article_4D93D1CB-99EE-134E-C14B-48CCF775A9C3", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/19/us/imelda-rain-forecast-thursday-wxc/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-09-19T10:32:02Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-09-20T12:10:12Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-09-20T12:10:12Z", "path": "/2019/09/19/us/imelda-rain-forecast-thursday-wxc", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Steve Almasy, Jason Hanna and Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN", "contributors": ["Steve Almasy", "Jason Hanna"], "headline": "Hundreds of cars abandoned in Houston after drivers couldn't get through floodwaters", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190919130144-flooding-texas-imelda-story-body.jpg"}, {"_id": "h_0dab899bba01cdf824649b0e5d6cf3a5", "type": "article", "body": "Want to make a political donation to your preferred presidential candidate?

Whistleblower scandal OK, this story is really complicated, so let's just start at the beginning. A whistleblower inside the intelligence community filed a complaint about communications between President Trump and a foreign leader. The whistleblower was alarmed by a \"promise\" Trump allegedly\u00a0made to the foreign leader. The Democratically led House Intelligence Committee wants to see the complaint, but Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence, has blocked that. (He's set to testify before the committee next week.) The White House and Justice Department told the Office of the Director of National Intelligence not to share the complaint because they don't believe it's governed by laws covering intelligence whistleblowers, three sources told CNN. Then, yesterday the Washington Post and New York Times reported that the communications at the center of all this involved Ukraine.\u00a0Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by phone in July. Some Trump supporters\u00a0have\u00a0pushed\u00a0for the Ukrainian government\u00a0to open investigations that the President could use to raise suspicions about his political rivals, including Joe Biden. Some observers wonder if there's a connection between the push for an investigation and Trump's call with Zelensky. But there's no public evidence that the whistleblower's complaint pertains to the Trump-Zelensky call. The potential ramifications of this story are starting to become more clear, CNN political analyst Stephen Collinson says,\u00a0and the risks facing the President, the intelligence community and Democrats in Congress are climbing by the day. Here are 5 key questions about the whistleblower case. 2. Justin Trudeau Another day, another apology from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. After a third incident emerged of him wearing brownface or blackface, he was forced to meet with reporters for the second day in a row to say he's sorry for wearing racist makeup. He also flat out said he doesn't remember how many times he's worn blackface. Trudeau, known for his uber-progressive views, insists he's still an ally in the fight for social justice. But this scandal and other recent political hiccups could mix to seriously threaten his chances at re-election next month. 3. Israel It's been three days since votes were cast in Israel's elections, and we still don't know who will be leading the country. Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White party, declared victory because his party is projected to win a few more seats in Israel's legislature than Likud, the political party headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But Gantz won't have enough seats to govern. He'd probably have to form a coalition with Netanyahu to do that, and that's probably not going to happen. So, that brings up another possibility: Israel may have to have a third election to settle the political gridlock. 4. Weather The remnants of Tropical Storm Imelda are\u00a0pushing into northern Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana today, dumping heavy rain along the way.\u00a0The storm left quite the mess in southeast Texas, where some areas got more than 30 inches of rain. Flooding was so bad in Houston that hundreds of cars were abandoned after rising water made some roads impassable. Meanwhile, out in the Atlantic, Hurricane Jerry has developed. It's a Category 1 storm right now and is expected to pass just north of the Leeward Islands today before moving north of Puerto Rico and the Bahamas over the weekend. 5. Climate strike If your co-worker or classmate isn't around today, it may not be because they're getting an early jump on the weekend. They could be on strike. Global climate strikes are taking place today all over the world, with people walking out of workplaces and classrooms to demand action to address the climate crisis. It's expected to be the biggest day of climate demonstrations in history. More than 100,000 people gathered in Melbourne, Australia. Some workers from Amazon and Microsoft are walking off the job. Some companies are actually supporting their employees' participation in the strike. New York City gave 1.1 million students the OK to skip school for it. Click here to keep up with the latest.

The calls included 407 high-water rescues, 22 major accidents, and 323 stranded vehicles Ed Gonzalez, the Harris Country Sheriff, tweeted a photo of his team. \"Couldn\u2019t be prouder of my HCSO Texas family for their effort today,\" he wrote. Houston officials are advising residents with private drinking wells to boil their water after the heavy rains caused a wastewater spill on Thursday. As of Thursday afternoon, more than 100,000 gallons of wastewater had been released at Eastex Freeway and Parker Road. Those who receive their water from the city are not impacted by the spill, said the city in a press release. Anyone within a half mile from the spill site who uses a private drinking water supply well or private water should only use water that has been distilled or boiled. The release also said those affected residents should have their water tested and disinfected before they stop boiling. Houston Mayor\u00a0Sylvester Turner is advising people to be careful and stay off the roads tonight.  In a press conference Thursday night, Turner said the water is receding and the storm has passed, but it will take time for the roads to dry out.\u00a0There has been no rain reported in the last hour, he said. Emergency crews are working overnight to observe for structural damage due to the flooding, and officials will continue to focus on clearing the freeways and streets. Yamile Arango, a Colombian journalist living in Texas, shared images showing extensive flooding at Houston's Buffalo Bayou Park. The park, which is a popular destination for bike riders and dog walkers, occupies 160 acres in the heart of Houston. See more photos of the flooded park below:   Flight operations for arrivals will resume in at George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) Friday, according to a tweet from IAH Friday night.

A man who was pulled from a van submerged in Houston floodwaters has died after being transported to a hospital, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez tweeted Thursday evening. The man, who was in his 40s or 50s, was one of at least three people removed from the van.\u00a0 The driver of the van was traveling westbound on Will Clayton Parkway and approached Eastex Freeway, where the water was about 8 feet high, Gonzalez said. The driver briefly paused before accelerating into the water, the sheriff said.\u00a0 The Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office is still on scene attempting to locate others, Gonzalez said. Texas' Jefferson County has received 43.15 inches of rain, making Imelda the 7th wettest tropical cyclone in US history, according to the National Weather Service in Houston. The service warned the totals are preliminary.  If the total stands, Imelda would also be the 4th wettest tropical cyclone to hit Texas, the weather service tweeted. Deputies removed at least three people from a submerged vehicle in Harris County, a sheriff's official said.  A man in his 40\u2019s or 50\u2019s has been transported in critical condition after being pulled from the vehicle, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said in a series of tweets Thursday evening. The vehicle was found near Estex Freeway and Will Clayon Parkway, the sheriff said. \"Prayers for my team and the occupants,\" Gonzalez tweeted. The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office on Thursday released new aerial photos showing flooded streets and neighborhoods. \"I-10 is still closed and rescues are still ongoing.

The Spring Fire Department has rescued 100 people today due to the storm. The crew at Fire Station 74 carried out rescues in the Sandpiper Trails neighborhood in East Spring, the Spring Fire Department wrote on Facebook. Here's a look at the rescues: The Harris County Sheriff's Office has received 133 high-water rescue calls since noon Thursday. The sheriff's office tweeted that it has also received 310 weather-related calls stemming from Imelda, which has lingered over southeastern Texas since Tuesday. Authorities also shared this video of a high-water vehicle driving through Aldine:  A couple was driving back after dropping their nephew off when they spotted some ranchers and horses struggling to escape flood waters in Spring, Texas.  Edward and Maya Gonzalez pulled over and also saw a man in a red T-shirt swept into the bushes by the current on Cypresswood Drive Thursday. Once the ranchers got the horses out safely, they went back for the man, Edward Gonzalez told CNN. All of the horses and people escaped the floodwaters safely. The following video shows part of the rescue: The Houston Health Department is warning people to stay out of floodwaters to avoid health hazards. Anyone who comes into contact with floodwater should wash the area with soap and water, take care of wounds and seek medical attention if necessary. They should also wash any clothes contaminated with floodwater before reusing them, the agency said in a statement.\u00a0 A high-water vehicle was spotted evacuating people from Beaumont, Texas, as remnants of Imelda continue to thrash a southeastern portion of the state. Police in Beaumont, 85 miles east of Houston, have received hundreds of calls for\u00a0rescues. They also urged people\u00a0not to drive because most roads were flooded. Several shelters are open to assist flooding evacuees, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner announced at a news conference. These shelters are now open for residents:  Gallery Furniture Mattress Mack\nLakewood Church\nNortheast Multi Service Center\nKingwood Community Center\nHarvest Time Church Rice University has canceled all its afternoon classes due to the storm, according to an email. The email was sent to staff and students. Here's what it said: \"Rice is currently under a FLASH FLOOD WARNING. All those who are off campus should not travel until the storm water has drained. Please communicate any absences to your faculty advisor, magister or supervisor. We are expecting 4 - 8 additional inches of rain in the next few hours.\u00a0Those who are on campus should stay on campus until the water recedes\" Dismissal for students of the Aldine Independent School District in unincorporated Harris County will be delayed due to road conditions, according to Mike Keeney, director of External Communications for the district. Keeney tells CNN the transportation company is out now assessing road conditions and students will continue to shelter in place. The district received reports of a lightning strike near Aldine High School and a subsequent fire, but those reports were unfounded and there was no fire, Keeney said. The Texas National Guard will set up operations in the Beaumont-Port Arthur Texas region to support local, state and federal agencies dealing with the remnants of Imelda, according to Brandon Jones, press secretary for the Texas Military Department. The National Guard\u2019s assets will include high-profile vehicles and UH-60 Blackhawks on standby. \u201cWe stand ready to support Texans in need and we won't rest until we've made every effort to rescue those in harm's way. Our guardsmen conduct regular and routine training exercises to prepare for situations like Tropical Depression Imelda,\u201d Jones said. A man was spotted floating down a feeder road for Houston's I-59 highway with a noodle as the city contends with the remnants of former Tropical Depression Imelda. \"Gotta make the best of it,\" the man reportedly said, according to a tweet from ABC 13's Katherine Marchand Thursday afternoon.  Serious flooding has been seen just north of Houston and to the east, including the city of Beaumont. The storm has been hitting southeastern Texas since Tuesday.  A wall has collapsed onto a ramp leading into The Galleria mall's parking garage in Houston, Texas. CBS Chicago anchor Audrina Bigos, who is in Houston on personal travel, captured this photo of the collapse: A rescue truck from the Harris County Sheriff's Office is on the way to a daycare in North Houston following reports of some flooding. Academic Academy Daycare is located at 11948 Gloger St. in the Houston community of Aldine.  \"Parents be advised, kids are OK, they are safe. Staff there is doing good. Facility has taken in some water, but kiddos & staff are in a room with no water,\" the sheriff's office tweeted Thursday afternoon. The George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) is asking people who were planning to pick up passengers to \"delay\" their plans due to flooding on the roads approaching the airport. \"Roads approaching the airport are flooded, if you have to pick someone up from the airport right now, delay your drive,\" IAH said in a tweet. \"The airport is open, we have power and restaurants are open, so your passenger will be OK.\" Earlier Thursday, IAH announced a \"full ground stop\" at the airport because of the conditions created by Imelda. Space Center Houston announced it is closing at 1 p.m. local time today \u201cto protect the safety of its guests and workers during hazardous weather,\" according to a statement.

The Cajun Navy left Louisiana this morning and is heading to Beaumont, Texas, to help rescue people during the flooding. The volunteer group has helped during a number of hurricanes and natural disasters, including\u00a0Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in 2017, and\u00a0massive flooding in New Orleans in 2016. Three people suffered minor injuries after the roof of a postal facility in Houston collapsed this morning, according to the city's fire department. The Houston Fire Department said the collapse occurred in the building's mail distribution area. \"The building was occupied at the time but everyone made it out,\" the fire department tweeted. Misty Walton\u2019s apartment in Vidor, Texas, was inundated with water as remnants from Imelda moved through state. Walton said her apartment and two cars in the driveway were flooded. \u201cHarvey was bad and this is bad too,\u201d Walton said. \u201cPeople are not even done rebuilding here and it's happening again.\u201d Walton said rescue teams are at work in the area with the Cajun Navy. \u201cI don't know what we're going to do I don't know what all of us were going to do but like always we pull together and we find a way,\u201d she said. As of noon ET (11 a.m. CT), George Bush Intercontinental Airport\u00a0in Houston has received 6.42 inches of rain in two hours. The airport averages 4.07 inches of rain for the entire month of September. Their September monthly record is 13.37 inches set back in 1913. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has declared a state of disaster in 13 counties impacted by remnants of Imelda. \u201cThe State of Texas is working closely with local officials and emergency personnel to provide the resources they need to keep Texans safe from Tropical Storm Imelda,\u201d Abbott said in a statement. The affected counties are: Brazoria, Chambers, Galveston, Hardin, Harris, Jasper, Jefferson, Liberty, Matagorda, Montgomery, Newton, Orange and San Jacinto. Texas' Hardin County has issued a mandatory evacuation order for Countrywood Estates, Pinewood Estates and Town of Rose Hill Acres. The order covers \u201call areas currently flooded and flood-prone areas.\u201d  The county, which is located north of Beaumont, Texas, is being impacted by heavy rains from the remnants of Imelda. Mark Simmons took video from his front porch of the deluge of rain being dropped by the remnants of Imelda.   This is what it sounds like: Beaumont-based local news outlet 12News was forced after its station flooded, according to the news organization's website. \"We have gone to a backup news station and will be back on the air as soon as possible,\" the station wrote online. The post also notes that they are now broadcasting from KHOU 11 in Houston. All of its employees are safe. Flash flooding is happening in parts of southeastern Texas, the National Weather Service said in its latest update on Imelda Thursday morning. \"Significant and life threatening flash flooding is ongoing,\" the weather service said. Flash flood emergencies are in effect for parts of southeastern Texas, eastern Texas and western Louisiana. Residents of the Gilbert Lake Estates in Jefferson County, Texas, need to evacuate right now, the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office warned. The office said that the levee at Green Pond Gulley  \"could break at any moment.\" The Sheriff's office said there are not many rescue boats in the area, and asked people who do have boats to help evacuate neighbors. The levee holds 4,600 to 5,600 acres of water, according to the sheriff's office. Here's the full statement: Local emergency offices are asking residents of Harris, Montgomery, Liberty and Chambers Counties to shelter in place in response to the flood emergencies caused by Imelda, \"Do not venture onto any roads in the warned areas. People traveling on area highways need to avoid these areas and change travel plans,\" the alert said. \"If you are trapped in your house due to flooding, call emergency personnel for evacuation rescue\" National Weather Service Houston/Galveston sent out the message on its official Twitter account. George Bush Intercontinental Airport\u00a0in Houston is at a full ground stop because of the rainfall and severe weather in the area. Right now, flooding is most serious north and east of Houston, including the city of Beaumont, where police said they've received hundreds of calls for\u00a0rescues\u00a0and were begging people\u00a0not to drive because most roads were flooded. Matt Star is staying at the Courtyard Marriott in Beaumont, Texas. He told CNN he was going to get some sleep while there was still power after working the night shift \u2014 but he was woken up by hotel staff members. \u201cA hotel staff member just knocked on my door and told me not to flush the toilet. She also said that the stairway closest to my room at the end of the hall was the least flooded,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0 Star took this video from his room this morning: The US Coast Guard has deployed representatives to the Emergency Operations centers of Jefferson County, Harris County and the city of Houston in response to Imelda, according to Petty Officer Johanna Strickland, spokesperson for the US Coast Guard Sector Houston-Galveston.  The Coast Guard also has three shallow water boats along with teams stationed in Orange County. These units were deployed from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and more assets are on the way from other units, Strickland told CNN. The command center for the Houston-Galveston sector is currently receiving calls for assistance and their helicopters are standing by for assistance as needed, Strickland said. More than 25 inches of rain has fallen in 12 hours in Jefferson County, Texas, according to National Weather Service data.\u00a0More than 33 inches has fallen there since the rain began on Tuesday. Some context: Any rainfall totals of more than 30 inches in 24 hours represent a 1 in 500-year rainfall event.\u00a0It is worth noting that these totals are still less than the region received in Harvey in 2017. Although the storm rain totals haven't reached Harvey levels, the hourly rate of rainfall is impressive and the reason flash flooding is occurring. Rainfall rates are reaching as high as 5 to 6 inches per hour in the storm. Lupe Torres is at the Elegante Hotel in Beaumont, Texas. What once was a hotel hallway is now a flowing river. Floodwaters from Tropical Depression Imelda haven't just creeped into the hotel, they're running through it. Watch the moment: Torres said he has moved his car to higher ground, where it will hopefully be safe. The Houston resident is in Beaumont for work. He said Hurricane Harvey's devastating flooding in the Houston area has wiped all his fear of flooding away. Water is still rising in Beaumont, Texas, and the Texas Game Wardens are out and about doing their part to help.  They're conducting water rescues in airboats alongside state and local partners. Watch more: Not only is southeast Texas dealing with flooding rainfall but the storms are violent enough to produce over 1,600 lightning strikes in an hour. \"When tropical systems decrease in intensity they usually don't produce as much lightning,\" says CNN meteorologist Chad Myers.\u00a0 This morning's thunderstorms aren't what you would expect from a tropical disturbance that should be decreasing in intensity as it continues to move over land. Imelda could still drop 5 to 10 more inches of rain on the Upper Texas Coast region Thursday, bringing three-day totals to as high as 25 to 35 inches in some places. In Chambers County, which includes Winnie, at least 200 homes were taking on water, Sheriff Brian Hawthorne said. In Beaumont, about 80 miles east of Houston, police told people to \"shelter in place and seek high ground.\" \"DO NOT drive a vehicle on BMT (Beaumont) roads. Most access roads are under water,\" Beaumont police\u00a0said on Twitter\u00a0Thursday morning. \"Rescue/Evacuation requests are being prioritized. Please only call 911 for life threatening situations.\" Here's the tweet: The Chambers County Sheriff has deployed high water rescue vehicles and airboats in response to the heavy rainfall and flooding from Imelda, the agency said in a post on its Facebook page.  The Emergency Operation Center has established a Red Cross Shelter at White Park and a staging area at the East Chambers ISD Dome. \"The community of Winnie is being devastated by rising water,\" the sheriff's office wrote on Facebook. They added: \"The rescues are being prioritized by the emergent needs of the situation.\" In Chambers County, which includes Winnie, at least 200 homes were taking on water, Sheriff Brian Hawthorne said Thursday The Facebook post also included two images, including one of an airboat conducting a rescue: It was 4:55 a.m. in Beaumont, Texas when 25-year-old Ryan Perrault woke up. He stepped out of bed; his foot didn't land on carpet it landed in water.  Tropical Depression Imelda is dumping massive amounts of rain, causing widespread and extremely dangerous flooding in the area. Perrault's first floor room at the Fairfield Inn had water come in from the window air conditioning unit.   \"We immediately started picking our things up and knocking on everyone\u2019s doors to try and notify them that we were taking in water,\" he told CNN.   Outside, he said pretty much everything was flooded and there was no chance of anyone leaving.   \"Everyone\u2019s cars are done for and almost completely under water,\" Perrault said. \"And we just lost power so we are currently stuck here until this blows over.\"\u00a0 He said he swam out to the truck to try and get as many of his tools as possible before the water ruined everything in it.  They now have no power. He said staff at the hotel are manually writing down names and room numbers to try and get guests on the flooded first floor evacuated to the second and third floors.  He says that 10 people are still waiting for a room. Flooding is most serious in counties just to the north and east of Houston \u2014 in places like Chambers and Jefferson counties, and its communities such as Beaumont and Winnie.  Thursday is the third straight day Imelda is deluging the region. Floodwaters intruded onto Interstate 10 early Thursday near Winnie east of Houston, trapping motorists like Steve Castle. \"I was supposed to be driving back to Houston. I don't think I'm going anywhere soon,\" Castle told CNN from his truck on the highway.

Speaks Spanish fluently. He named his son, Ulysses, after the Greek hero in Homer's Odyssey.  O'Rourke was a member of two punk rock bands. He played guitar for the band known as Foss, which released an EP called \"The El Paso Pussycats.\" He also played with a band called the Sheeps, who wore sheep masks and long johns during performances.  Timeline:\nMay 1995 - O'Rourke is charged with a misdemeanor for burglary. He later says of the incident that he \"jumped a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso which resulted in a burglary charge.\" The charge is later dropped.   1999 - At age 26, O'Rourke co-founds Stanton Street Technology Group, an El Paso-based web design company.  September 1998 - O'Rourke is arrested for drunk driving and charged with a DWI. He completes a diversion program and the charges are dismissed.

September 12, 2019 - During the third Democratic debate, O'Rourke reiterates his support for a mandatory gun-buyback program of assault-style rifles and said, \"Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\" O'Rourke's comments came in the wake of a string of mass shootings in the United States, including in his hometown of El Paso, where 22 people were gunned down at a Walmart in August. O'Rourke unveiled a proposal weeks after the shooting calling for a national gun registry, a nationwide gun licensing system and the mandatory buyback of assault-style rifles as part of his plan to curb gun violence and the rise of white nationalism.", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190405124300-22-beto-orourke-story-body.jpg", "tags": [{"id":

Among them were the\u00a0Galveston Independent School District, Houston Independent School District and Texas A&M University at Galveston.\nAnother storm brewing: Tropical Depression 10 is brewing in the Atlantic Ocean and is expected to become Tropical Storm Jerry by Wednesday. The storm could become a hurricane by the end of the week as it passes near or just north of the Lesser Antilles, CNN Meteorologist Taylor Ward said. Imelda is one of six named storms currently brewing around the globe.  A hurricane and a tropical storm are churning in the Atlantic ocean and three tropical storms have formed in the Pacific ocean. These are the storms we're watching: Hurricane Humberto is a Category 3 storm in the Atlantic Ocean. It's forecast to pass close to Bermuda tonight. \nTropical Storm Jerry is 855 miles east of the Leeward Islands. The storm is expected to become a hurricane by Thursday night.\nTropical Storm Lorena is about 100 miles from Manzanillo, Mexico. It's expected to become a hurricane as it travels northwest, up the Mexican coast.\nTropical Storm Mario, which is further off the coast of Mexico, is also expected to strengthen into a Hurricane.\nTropical Storm Kiko is in the Pacific Ocean, more than 1,100 miles from Baja, California. The National Weather Service in League City, Texas, issued a flash flood warning for south central Galveston County and southeastern Brazoria County in southeastern Texas. The service said the area has already gotten 5 to 10 inches of rain in the past day, and more rain is expected to come soon.  \"Flash flooding is expected to begin shortly,\" the service said in an advisory. Parts of Galveston, Texas, have begun to flood from Tropical Depression Imelda. The storm is dumping rain over southeastern Texas and is expected to keep doing so\u00a0for a couple of days\u00a0as it moves inland. KTRK\u2019s Courtney Fischer shot this video in the Strand district downtown, which was starting to flood from the heavy rains. \u00a0Watch: Imelda could produce 20 to 25 inches of rain as it makes it way through eastern Texas, the National Weather Service predicts in its latest storm advisory. Imelda is currently moving slowly north toward the Houston and Galveston areas of the state. Heavy rain and significant flash flooding is forecast over eastern Texas during the next couple days.  Water levels are elevated in Harris County creeks following about 9 inches of rain overnight, according to Jeff Lindner, director of Flood Operations for the county. Officials at the Harris County Flood Control District are \u201ckeeping a close eye on\u201d Cleared Creek, Turkey Creek and Armand Bayou. \u201cA break in rain this morning will alleviate,\u201d the flooding but more rain is expected this afternoon and into tomorrow, Linder said. More context: The term \"bankfull\" refers to when the water level of a stream, river or lake is at the top of its banks and any further rise would result in water moving into the flood plain, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers. \u00a0 Rescue teams in southeast Texas are getting ready for Imelda, which is forecast to bring flooding to the area even after weakening to a tropical depression. Red flag warnings\u00a0have gone up along the coast of Galveston, Texas. And the federal search and rescue team\u00a0Texas A&M Task Force 1\u00a0has moved into the city in preparation for possible rescues, according to\u00a0CNN affiliate KTRK. \"Our forte is water rescue, both flood rescue and swift water rescue,\" Palmer Buck, with Task Force 1, told the station. \"I have crews from Fort Worth fire, as well as Longview fire that will be stationed here overnight.\" A National Guard team is also expected to arrive today. As Tropical Depression Imelda drenches the Houston area, Bermuda is\u00a0dealing with Hurricane Humberto.  The Category 3 storm is expected to pass dangerously close to the island territory tonight. A hurricane warning has been issued by the Bermuda Weather Service.  Here's a look at the latest forecast from the National Hurricane Center: Several schools in the Houston-Galveston canceled classes and activities Wednesday due to Tropical Depression\u00a0Imelda. The Galveston Independent School District canceled classes Wednesday. \u201cThe combination of pre-dawn rain and high tide indicate a probable safety issue for students and staff.\u00a0\u00a0Safe travel to and from Galveston ISD is a primary concern,\u201d the school district said in a statement.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the Houston Independent School District canceled after-school activities and sporting events due to inclement weather.

Imelda formed over the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday afternoon and made landfall near Freeport, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm was dumping rain over southeastern Texas and is expected to keep doing so for a couple of days as it moves inland.  \"Many of the forecast models are suggesting 6 to 10 inches of rain with isolated higher amounts across the region,\" CNN meteorologist Judson Jones said. \"If the forecast holds, the amount of rain to fall would be the highest storm total rainfall since Hurricane Harvey in 2017.\" Imelda had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph Tuesday evening, the NHC said in an advisory. A tropical storm warning was in effect for along the Texas coast from Sargent to Port Bolivar, the center said.  Also, a flash flood watch covering more than 7 million people and including Houston and Galveston was in effect and likely to be extended into Thursday. \"Rain will be in the area over the next several days and could cause some flooding. Be careful driving and please pay attention to the weather reports,\" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said in a post on Twitter. \"Be alert.!\" Several schools and universities in the Houston and Galveston area announced they will cancel activities Wednesday. Among them were the Galveston Independent School District, Houston Independent School District and Texas A&M University at Galveston. Even before Imelda became a tropical storm, it was a system that was raining on coastal Texas. By Tuesday evening, as much as 5 inches of rain had fallen in some areas southeast of Houston, according to the Harris County Flood Warning System. Most areas of Houston saw a 1/2 inch to 1 inch of rain.  The storm system is expected to drench coastal Texas and southwestern Louisiana into Wednesday, and eastern Texas and western Louisiana on Thursday, the hurricane center said. Flooding problems in Houston Harvey deluged the Houston area for days in late August 2017, causing disastrous flooding, claiming dozens of lives and causing billions of dollars in damage.  During that storm, more than 34 inches of rain were recorded at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, and more than 40 inches of rain were recorded in areas east of the city. Houston is no stranger to flooding. In May, for instance, heavy rain led to significant flooding in streets, homes and businesses. The city's layout and city planning are part of what makes its flooding problem worse, experts have said. Urban sprawl over past decades has turned water-absorbing greenery into concrete. Weak regulations have failed to properly estimate the potential hazards of flooding. Finally, poor reservoir and land management have revealed a lack of long-term planning on these issues, the experts have said. Another storm brewing Tropical Depression 10 is brewing in the Atlantic Ocean and is expected to become a Tropical Storm Jerry by Wednesday. The storm could become a hurricane by the end of the week as it passes near or just north of the Lesser Antilles, CNN Meteorologist Taylor Ward said.

Under Article II of the Constitution, the President nominates justices to the Supreme Court, with the \"advice and consent of the Senate.\" If a vacancy occurs when Congress is not in session, a recess appointment allows an appointee to serve without Senate approval until Congress reconvenes. One hundred and sixty-three nominations have been submitted to the Senate (including nominations for chief justice). Of those, there have been 126 confirmations, with seven instances of individuals declining to serve. Other Facts:\nThe American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary evaluates nominees to the Supreme Court for the Justice Department and the Senate Judiciary Committee. The organization has three possible rankings: qualified, well-qualified, and not qualified.   There is no requirement that the chief justice of the Supreme Court previously serve as an associate justice, but five of the 17 chief justices have. Three justices served on the Court immediately before being elevated to chief justice: Edward D. White, Harlan Fiske Stone and William Rehnquist. Two justices had a break between their service as associate justice and being appointed chief justice: Charles Evans Hughes and John Rutledge. Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed nine justices during his 12-year presidency, the most since George Washington. Jimmy Carter is the only president to complete a full term of office and never have the opportunity to nominate a Supreme Court justice.

Lily Mae Avant, 10, swam in the Brazos River and Lake Whitney in Bosque County near Waco over Labor Day weekend, according to CNN affiliate KWTX-TV.  Then, on September 8, Lily \"began having a headache, and it was quickly followed by a fever,\" according to a Facebook page created to support the girl. Her family thought it was a viral infection at first, but after visits to the family doctor and Lily having trouble sleeping, the family knew something was wrong.  \"She was incoherent, unresponsive and was quickly swept up and taken to the ER,\" the family wrote on Lily's Facebook page. Lily was then flown to Cook Children's Health Care System in Fort Worth where a spinal tap found she had contracted Naegleria fowleri. \"It's every parent's worst nightmare,\" the girl's aunt, Crystal Warren, told KWTX Friday. \"For this to happen to her when there were so many other people in the same waters on the same days we just don't understand why it was her.\" Chris Dowdy, principal at Valley Mills Elementary School, confirmed to CNN that a 5th-grade student was \"putting up a fierce battle for her life, caused by this awful amoeba.\" \"She is an outstanding student, but more importantly, she is just a tremendous person,\" Dowdy said. \"Everyone in our community, state, and even the entire country is praying for this sweet child.\"  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the amoeba is a single-cell living organism commonly found in warm freshwater like lakes and rivers. The amoeba enters the body through the nose, travels to the brain and destroys brain tissue, according to the CDC.  Between 2009 and 2018, the CDC says only 34 cases of the Naegleria fowleri infection were reported in the US. Only four people out of the 145 known cases survived between 1962 and 2018.

Smith shared images and video of Cordero on his Instagram Friday. \"She is in a better place now and she can rest easy,\" Smith captioned the post. \"My wifey my best friend and the mother of my beautiful daughter. Love you baby.\" Just last month, Smith posted another picture of Cordero announcing the birth of their daughter Haven Harris Smith. Cordero, 26, and Smith pulled over to the side of I-90 West in Cleveland around 2 a.m. Wednesday after a tire blew on Smith's 2019 Lamborghini, according to a statement from the Cleveland Browns. The car veered left and hit the median, but she exited the car without injuries. Shortly after, a woman in a 2017 Mazda 3 hit the passenger side of the car and Cordero, who was standing on the shoulder, Cleveland police said in a statement to CNN. Police and paramedics arrived on scene shortly after. Cordero was taken to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The driver of the second car was also taken to the hospital and was released after receiving care. A toxicology report is pending, but the woman admitted she had been drinking, police said. Smith was not impaired, police said.  The incident is under investigation, and no charges have been filed as of this time. The Browns said players were notified during a team meeting. Head coach Freddie Kitchens also visited Smith at his home. \"Words cannot describe the sorrow we feel for Chris following the loss of his girlfriend, Petara,\" team owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam said in a statement. \"Our entire organization mourns with Chris, his family and the Cordero family. We will do everything possible to offer them our support, comfort and any resources in this most difficult time.\" The Browns will have counselors on site throughout the week to provide emotional support for players and staff. Mary Cay Cabot of Cleveland.com says Cordero and Smith's daughter was born four weeks ago. Smith was excused from the Browns' preseason game against the Indianapolis Colts in August, so he could attend the birth of his daughter. Smith, 27, was drafted in 2014 by the Jaguars. He has been with the Browns since last year. Correction: A previous version of this article misstated Chris Smith's name.

As part of the sentence, Brooke Skylar Richardson, 20, was to spend seven days in the county jail, but Warren County Judge Donald Oda II credited her with time already served.  Should she violate any terms of her supervision, Richardson could face up to 12 months behind bars, the judge said. Richardson had been found not guilty of aggravated murder, involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment in the case, which has gone on for more than two years, since the remains of her newborn daughter, Annabelle, were found buried in her Carlisle backyard.  The infant's remains will be released to the Richardson family, which will provide a proper burial and give access to the site to the family of the baby's father, Oda said. \"I'm forever sorry,\" Richardson said prior to sentencing. When the verdicts were read out Thursday, Richardson sobbed before she was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs. 'Life is precious,' judge says The infant's paternal grandmother spoke at the hearing, telling the court that she had struggled to find the \"right word\" to describe the pain she's endured since learning of her grandchild, who would've now been 2 years, 4 months, 1 week old. \"'Broken,' 'shattered,' 'destroyed,'\" she said. \"None of them seem to fit the amount of pain I have felt ever since we found out that not only did I lose my first grandchild, but my baby -- who I would lay down my life for without a thought -- lost his first child, and Skylar had no intention of letting us know.\"  The defense and Richardson's father asked for leniency, citing her compliance with the requirements of her pre-trial supervision.  \"I would do anything and above that you ask, and I understand,\" Richardson told the judge. \"And I just wanted to say how sorry I was. I can sometimes be selfish, but I would like to think that I've become better in the knowledge that I've upset everyone and hurt so many people with what I've done.\"  Before handing down the sentence, the judge addressed the defendant, telling her, \"I've always sort of thought of this case, Ms. Richardson, as a story of two little girls -- Skylar Richardson and Annabelle Richardson.  \"I think what often gets overlooked ... is just how precious life is,\" he said. \"Your life, Annabelle's life. Life is precious, and it should be protected, and it should be guarded in all respects.\"  The maximum possible sentence Oda could have granted was 12 months in prison and a $2,500 fine. But the judge called the case a \"mandatory community control case,\" since Richardson had no prior criminal record, among other criteria. That limited him to ordering a sentence of, at most, six months in county jail, he said, which prosecutors called for. Baby was found 2 months after childbirth  Richardson delivered her baby at home in her bedroom the night of May 7, 2017, when she was 18, CNN affiliate WKRC reported. Two months after the baby she named Annabelle was born, investigators found the skeletal remains in a shallow grave with a flower on top placed by Richardson, according to the affiliate.  The sheriff's office started an investigation that led to the remains after Richardson showed up at her doctor's office -- where she'd taken a pregnancy test -- without a baby, prosecutors said in closing arguments.   Prosecutors said when the doctor asked, she burst into tears and said the baby was not alive at childbirth and she'd buried her in the backyard.  Prosecutors painted a picture of a teen who was in a new relationship at the time and wanted nothing to do with the baby or the man who impregnated her. They alleged she killed the baby after she gave birth in the middle of the night, believing she'd have no future as a mother.   \"Upon finding out that she was pregnant by a boy she had nothing to do with, Brooke Richardson burst into tears and told her doctor that she could not have this baby,\" Prosecutor Steve Knippen told jurors, according to the station.  It said prosecutors showed the court a picture of her at the gym hours after giving birth and said she sent a message to her mother.  \"My belly is back, OMG. I am never, ever, ever, ever letting it get like this again. You're about to see me looking freaking better than before, OMG,\" the text message said, according to Knippen.  Her defense team said there was no evidence the baby was born alive. Richardson has maintained that Annabelle was not moving or breathing when she was born, her defense team said. \"She buried her daughter and marked the grave with flowers on top of it.

(You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Campaign 2020 The main draw for the third Democratic presidential debate was supposed to be the first on-stage showdown between Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. There were some fireworks there, but the main action seemed to come from the younger (and lower-polling) candidates, like\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro, Beto O'Rourke, Pete Buttigieg and Cory Booker. They took on their higher-polling elders -- Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- with mixed results. Castro delivered the sharpest attack of the night, a jab about Biden's memory (and thus, his age) that made the audience gasp and some of the other candidates step in and chastise him. The fight over health care took over a big chunk of the debate, with Biden saying the \"Medicare for All\" plans that many of the candidates support\u00a0would just be too expensive. The emotional subject of guns came up, too, with O'Rourke forcefully answering, \"Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\" to a question about taking people's guns away. When it was all over, though, the debate didn't seem to change the trajectory of this race all that much, reports CNN's Maeve Reston.

Census question Chief Justice John Roberts cast the deciding vote against the Trump administration's attempt to add a\u00a0citizenship question to the 2020 census. But he only did it\u00a0after changing his position behind the scenes, sources told CNN in this exclusive report. Roberts was all set to join the Supreme Court's four conservative justices and rule for the administration. But he changed his mind -- and his vote -- because he believed the administration's rationale for adding the citizenship question was contrived. Roberts' action in the case proves he's getting less predictable as he becomes the de facto swing vote on the divided court, says CNN legal analyst & Supreme Court biographer Joan Biskupic. 3. California boat fire The charred wreckage of the Conception dive boat was lifted off the ocean floor yesterday. The boat sank on Labor Day off the California coast after a fire that killed 34 people. The boat was put on a barge and taken to an undisclosed location. A preliminary report on the tragedy from the\u00a0National Transportation Safety Board said the Conception didn't have a crew member working as a roving overnight watch, like it was supposed to. Commercial boat operators have also been asked, via a Coast Guard safety bulletin, to limit unsupervised cell phone charging. An NTSB official has said investigators have been looking at the Conception's engineering and wiring\u00a0and know \"there was a lot of gear on board with the cameras and the crew, cameras, phones, extra batteries.\" 4. Weather There's a new threat to the Bahamas\u00a0brewing in the Atlantic. It's a\u00a0storm system that's churning a little more than 230 miles away. Meteorologists think it'll turn into a tropical storm over the weekend and could threaten the northern islands of the Bahamas that were just hit hard by Hurricane Dorian. Tropical storm watches and warnings have been issued in the Bahamas and parts of Florida's east coast. The storm\u00a0could bring wind and rain to the Bahamas today before hitting Florida tomorrow. The Atlantic hurricane season is at its statistical peak,\u00a0a period when weather conditions favor storms forming quickly. Click here to track the storm system. 5. Russia Russia's ruling party suffered big losses in Moscow's municipal elections. Now, members of the country's opposition say\u00a0the ruling party is retaliating via nationwide raids. The regional offices of\u00a0opposition leader Alexei Navalny, as well as the homes of dozens of staff and supporters, were raided, Navalny's team said yesterday. There were reportedly more than 200 searches in 41 Russian cities, causing some to compare the raids to the mass arrests during the height of Soviet repression. Navalny had called for a \"smart voting\" strategy during the Moscow elections, and it seemed to work. United Russia, the ruling party that supports\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin, lost almost a third of its seats. THIS JUST IN ...

(You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Immigration The White House gets a big victory on immigration from the Supreme Court. A Trump administration rule that dramatically limits the ability of Central American migrants to claim asylum can go into effect nationwide, the court said, even while legal challenges to it are still alive. The rule essentially bars people traveling through Mexico from being able to claim asylum at the US border. Meantime, the President's son-in-law,\u00a0Jared Kushner, met with Senate Republicans to try to get them on board with\u00a0the White House's proposal to overhaul\u00a0legal immigration, though many seemed skeptical. 2. Vaping The Trump administration is working to ban flavored e-cigarettes. A new policy is coming from the FDA that would require e-cigarette companies to get flavored versions of their products off the market. Health officials have argued that flavored e-cigarettes are too appealing to teens, and vaping use has skyrocketed among young people. But tobacco companies claim flavored e-cigarettes help get adults to quit\u00a0traditional cigarettes. 3. Campaign 2020 It's Debate Night in America (again). The third Democratic presidential debate is tonight in Houston, and it'll only be a one-night affair. The debate field was whittled down to 10 candidates because the presidential hopefuls had to reach\u00a0polling and fundraising benchmarks to quality (and many didn't). Tonight's big draw: seeing Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren side by side on a debate stage for the first time. Biden's advisers say the former veep will take it to Warren, saying the Dems need to nominate someone who can offer up \"more than plans.\" Also, the candidates have been warned not to curse. Wait, what? 4. Bahamas The number of people listed as missing in the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian stands at about 2,500. Government officials stress, though, that the list is preliminary and may include the names of people who have already been evacuated. Right now, the official death toll in the Bahamas is at 50. But that is expected to rise as search-and-rescue teams work their way through the parts of Grand Bahama and Abaco islands that were flattened by the hurricane. Meanwhile, meteorologists are keeping their eyes on two more tropical disturbances that could impact areas already devastated by Dorian. 5. Tariffs There's a small ceasefire right now in the trade war, and the markets are reacting positively. China announced yesterday it would waive tariffs on some US goods, the first time it's done that since the start of the trade war. President Trump responded by saying he's\u00a0pushing back\u00a0new tariffs on Chinese goods set to go into effect October 1 to October 15. Asian stocks rose slightly on the moves, and US market futures gained a little, as well. Economists think weak economic data from both countries will eventually force them to work out some kind of deal on trade. THIS JUST IN ...

Petara Cordero was in Smith's 2019 Lamborghini when the couple pulled over to the side of I-90 West in Cleveland around 2 a.m. after a tire blew. The car veered left and hit the median. Without significant injuries, Cordero got out of the car. Shortly after, a woman in a 2017 Mazda 3 hit the passenger's side of Smith's car and Cordero, who was standing on the shoulder, Cleveland police said in a statement to CNN. Police and paramedics arrived on scene shortly after. Cordero, 26, was taken to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The driver of the second car was also taken to the hospital, where she was to be released after receiving care. The woman admitted she had been drinking, police said. A toxicology report is pending.  Smith was not impaired, police said. The incident is under investigation, and no charges have been filed as of this time. The Browns said players were notified during a team meeting. Head coach Freddie Kitchens also visited Smith at his home. \"Words cannot describe the sorrow we feel for Chris following the loss of his girlfriend, Petara,\" team owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam said in a statement. \"Our entire organization mourns with Chris, his family and the Cordero family. We will do everything possible to offer them our support, comfort and any resources in this most difficult time.\" The Browns will have counselors on site throughout the week to provide emotional support for players and staff. Mary Cay Cabot of Cleveland.com says Cordero and Smith's daughter, Haven Harris Smith, was born four weeks ago. Smith was excused from the Browns' preseason game against the Indianapolis Colts in August, so he could attend the birth of his daughter.  Smith, 27, was drafted in 2014 by the Jaguars. He has been with the Browns since last year.", "sourceId": "article_1CABF49D-7E89-F442-CA67-217D263607EE", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/11/us/cleveland-browns-chris-smith-girlfriend-death-trnd/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-09-11T19:44:42Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-09-12T03:09:28Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-09-12T03:09:28Z", "path": "/2019/09/11/us/cleveland-browns-chris-smith-girlfriend-death-trnd", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Kendall Trammell, CNN", "contributors": ["Kendall Trammell"], "headline": "Cleveland Browns star's girlfriend dies in a car accident weeks after giving birth", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190911151912-cleveland-browns-chris-smith-story-body.jpg", "tags": [{"id": "ebe63711-0348-4c45-8c98-12d453234b73"}, {"id": "c53c6b11-9bf7-4092-bdf1-a0d73a6216da"}, {"id": "b21c6c7c-6fe4-4f10-85da-b81821c55578"}, {"id": "2582e2c4-df6c-52cc-b3e9-f0c72ce29803"}, {"id": "abadfb22-2b54-4cec-9148-4cdc03e8136a"}, {"id": "e4a063a5-2518-4e21-84e8-7007605546fe"}, {"id": "9be60ad9-610a-433a-9dc5-98f9545764b1"}, {"id": "def74471-b707-48b8-9a19-6db8eb06a6c1"}, {"id": "4eb3c9f3-c4c1-4dbc-bea5-c724ae5e15e2"}, {"id": "c921b291-efc3-4a7f-9346-44e06fdf8d58"}, {"id": "55dab895-a951-49d8-8811-dd1790b96406"}, {"id": "54ef0ee5-d2db-4249-9075-f7dca5103ba8"}, {"id": "43a86c46-f84a-4286-9feb-411447ecd501"}, {"id": "e473ff1c-0fac-4053-82b6-acbc7f875cb4"}, {"id": "3bfc5b1d-f595-449c-9d7d-6bda8723b3a6"}, {"id": "102bb4ce-a42b-56dd-b525-43eee18b4b76"}, {"id": "6794eb7b-fea7-55d5-ac22-079b8e510cdd"}, {"id": "6794eb7b-fea7-55d5-ac22-079b8e510cdd"}, {"id": "3696300e-318d-5004-b893-a59ce7b486f2"}, {"id": "63c54233-8271-458a-abd0-c26d298f7d3e"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "2a1fbdb6-333a-4b46-9ec8-29ca034d21ad"}, {"id": "28d880a2-7751-4914-8fc2-ea71eb30debc"}, {"id": "be6998eb-1fb8-4c65-aac9-5fc54bac30a5"}, {"id": "c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d"}, {"id": "3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "c456c24c-c275-43ed-975b-ce965c599d7b"}, {"id": "4290d5c1-210b-4d0d-9038-07ad0b80c7ee"}, {"id": "b47de7d7-778d-4298-88b4-f9aa442eb3af"}, {"id": "6f09f77f-0dfc-4aff-b1bb-06fb10e40e96"}, {"id": "49b3767f-e5b3-40be-aee2-f6c1d7c9fe7c"}, {"id": "de9f126b-0ff6-4737-b26c-b9f3f0a62a9b"}, {"id": "6fc4ca29-b7ec-54b3-b40c-5c22ec3bd6db"}, {"id": "42f1eba3-7d1d-5bb3-8bc9-b1194a502a25"}, {"id": "315a3b2a-b17d-5e70-823a-c7c913f4c518"}, {"id": "85186acd-6f35-432b-9fd7-5586c122151d"}, {"id": "ba65a338-c7ea-48df-a75f-f66b59576260"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "337c09bb-54aa-5bb8-a0b0-9eb352e2b9d2"}, {"id": "f6db90e5-869c-4c84-ad84-9324d2133373"}, {"id": "9e8220c2-bc38-5877-a4f8-636ed4870028"}, {"id": "f16b72d7-1fcb-5ab1-9804-ad08747d40b9"}, {"id": "2b008301-92f7-45f6-a84f-150870177b85"}, {"id": "0f29db09-cd1d-545e-8173-242ec83e2af4"}, {"id": "9c5826c0-329c-54ce-b065-3826ae02b3ab"}, {"id": "634295f7-23ed-5bbe-8d47-341601b7159e"}, {"id": "518c0efc-3d88-5b83-8cdc-cd83e54220b4"}, {"id": "2db6356f-830e-5f8e-9eb4-7694e3faf9e9"}, {"id": "edbe1e5e-ef24-4ab9-bfd1-b29c17df9f6f"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "tickers": []}, {"_id": "h_4a8a68aa391e1282505340a869a8c2e8", "type": "article", "livestorySourceId": "livestory_48c43176-8001-41b9-87ed-f416775d8bde", "sourceId": "article_A2D5ED6F-D873-C74E-3E54-205238B15F09", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/september-11-anniversary-2019/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-09-11T12:38:27.712Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-09-11T20:51:36.451Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-09-11T20:51:36.451Z", "path": "/us/live-news/september-11-anniversary-2019", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Meg Wagner", "contributors": ["Meg Wagner"], "headline": "America remembers 9/11", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190911100411-president-trump-9-11-memorial-pentagon-remarks-story-body.jpg", "tags": [{"id": "3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734"}, {"id": "275efabd-a8bc-5ce9-a202-b21989ba2df1"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d"}, {"id": "cd86b20b-6403-4e78-b813-1bb72ae1e550"}, {"id": "9b9aed9f-e3a5-479a-81e5-600f0b0cb607"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "tickers": [], "body": "Americans across the country marked the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks today. Family members of those killed in the attacks gathered in New York City this morning at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, the site of the World Trade Center in New York City. The names of the victims were read and the crowds observed two moments of silence \u2014 for when each of the planes struck the World Trade Center. Here's what else happened today: President Trump gave remarks at a ceremony in Arlington, Virginia. Days after Trump\u00a0scrapped peace talks at Camp David\u00a0with Afghan and Taliban leaders, he discussed the decision during a somber event commemorating the 18th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. \u201cWe had peace talks scheduled a few days ago,\u201d Trump said at the Pentagon event, adding that he canceled the talks after a Taliban car bomb\u00a0killed a US soldier\u00a0and 11 others last week. Trump claimed that in the last four days, \u201cWe have hit our enemy harder than they have ever been hurt before and that will continue.\u201d That line garnered applause.\nNew York schools held a moment of silence. This is the first 9/11 anniversary that all New York schools are required by law to have a moment of silence. The governor signed a new law mandating that all public schools across the state allow a brief moment of silence each year\u00a0to mark the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.\nAbout tonight: A Tribute in Light will shine upward from the 9/11 Memorial Plaza, which will be open until midnight. According to the museum's website, \"the lights will be on beginning at sunset on September 11 and will fade away at dawn on September 12.\" Family members of those killed in the 9/11 terror attacks gathered in New York City this morning at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, the site of the World Trade Center in New York City. The names of the victims were read and the crowds observed two moments of silence \u2014 for when each of the planes struck the World Trade Center. Here are some scenes from the September 11 memorial this morning: Many 2020 Democrats are marking the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks with tributes on Twitter. Here's how some of the candidates are honoring the victims and remembering the day:  Juli\u00e1n Castro Amy Klobuchar  Andrew Yang Kamala Harris Bernie Sanders Joe Biden Elizabeth Warren Beto O'Rourke Pete Buttigieg Cory Booker On Sept. 11, 2001, two filmmakers making a documentary about a New York firefighter found themselves instead documenting the attacks in Lower Manhattan.  Right after the first plane crashed, Jules Naudet followed FDNY rescue crews into the burning North Tower of the World Trade Center. His brother G\u00e9d\u00e9on Naudet filmed back at the firehouse before making his way to Ground Zero. The video they captured would later become a\u00a0documentary: \"9/11.\"\u00a0The brothers, along with retired firefighter and filmmaker James Hanlon, spoke to CNN about their experiences. Their footage \u2014 raw, chaotic and nearly inconceivable \u2014 offers a rare look into a day that continues to haunt the nation. You can watch the footage, moment by moment, here. Days after President Trump scrapped peace talks at Camp David with Afghan and Taliban leaders, he discussed the decision during a somber event commemorating the 18th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. \u201cWe had peace talks scheduled a few days ago,\u201d Trump said at the Pentagon event, adding that he cancelled the talks after a Taliban car bomb killed a US soldier and 11 others last week. \u201cThey thought they would use this attack to show strength, but actually what they showed is unrelenting weakness,\u201d he said. Trump claimed that in the last four days, \u201cWe have hit our enemy harder than they have ever been hurt before and that will continue.\u201d That line garnered applause. And, he warned, \u201cIf for any reason they come back to our country, we will go wherever they are and use power the likes of which the United States has never seen before.\u201d He clarified that the US would not use nuclear power, but said, \u201cThey have never seen anything like what will happen to them.\u201d He has made these comments before \u2014 but not in the setting of a September 11 commemoration. President Trump is speaking at the Pentagon, at a ceremony marking the 9/11 anniversary.  \"For every American who lived through that day, the September 11 attack is seared into our soul,\" Trump said. \"It was a day filled with\u00a0shock, horror, sorrow and\u00a0righteous fury.\" The President recounted how he learned about the news in 2001: \"I was sitting at home watching a\u00a0major business television show\u00a0early that morning.\u00a0Jack Welch, the legendary head of General Electric was about to\u00a0be interviewed when all of a\u00a0sudden they cut away.\u00a0At first, there were different\u00a0reports.\u00a0It was a boiler fire.\u00a0But I knew that boilers aren't\u00a0at the top of a building.\u00a0It was a kitchen explosion in\u00a0Windows on the World.\u00a0Nobody really knew what\u00a0happened.\" The President then extended his sympathies to the families of the victims. \"To each of you, the first lady\u00a0and I are united with you in\u00a0grief,\" he said. \"We come here in the knowledge\u00a0that we cannot erase the pain or\u00a0reverse the evil of that dark\u00a0and wretched day.\u00a0But we offer you all that we\u00a0have: our unwavering loyalty, our\u00a0undying devotion and our eternal\u00a0pledge that your loved ones will\u00a0never, ever be forgotten.\u00a0\" Earlier in the ceremony, the names of the 184 people who died in the Pentagon crash were read.\u00a0The President and first lady also laid a wreath.\u00a0 David Alvarez \u2014 the son of Luis Alvarez, the 9/11 first responder who died soon after giving emotional testimony before Congress \u2014 said this anniversary, the first without his dad, takes on a \"whole new meaning.\" Earlier this year, Alvarez, retired NYPD bomb squad detective, detailed\u00a0his medical issues\u00a0during an impassioned appeal for an extension of the\u00a0September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. He died in June. \"The day has meant a lot\u00a0to me ever since 2001,\u00a0ever since 9/11,\" David\u00a0Alvarez told CNN. \"But, as you mentioned, this is\u00a0the first time \u2014 first day of remembrance\u00a0that I don't have my father with\u00a0me.\u00a0And it absolutely takes on a\u00a0whole new meaning.\" David Alvarez said caring for his father in his final weeks inspired him to go back to school to study nursing. \"My hope is to help care for\u00a0other cancer patients.\u00a0Hopefully other first responders\u00a0as well,\" he said. On Sept. 11, 2001, 184 people were killed at the Pentagon when hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 was crashed into the building, the potent symbol of US military might. From 9:30 to 11 a.m. ET today, there will be a private ceremony at the\u00a0Pentagon Memorial\u00a0for survivors and families of those who were killed.  President Trump\u00a0is scheduled to attend, and he'll give remarks around 9:45 a.m. ET.

The museum's website says \"the lights will be on beginning at sunset on September 11 and will fade away at dawn on September 12.\" People have gathered at Ground Zero in New York City.  They are currently holding a moment of silence to mark the moment the second plane hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has signed a new law which mandates public schools across the state to allow a brief moment of silence each year to mark the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks. The law is intended to \"encourage dialogue and education in the classroom\" and to ensure that future generations understand the 2001 terrorist attack that took the lives of more than 3,000 people and its place in history, according to a statement from the governor's office. \"9/11 was one of the single darkest periods in this state's and this nation's history, and we owe it to those we lost and to the countless heroes who ran toward danger that day and the days that followed to do everything we can to keep their memory alive,\" said Cuomo. It's been 18 years since the 9/11 terror attacks. People have gathered in New York City for a moment of silence. President Trump and the first lady are  also observing a moment of silence at the White House."}, {"_id": "h_ac15101e670a7cc962fc3aa9ad619c3d", "type": "article", "sourceId": "article_E266A176-A360-EE8B-A585-CD3AAC5D0253", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2013/05/31/us/warren-buffett-fast-facts/index.html", "path": "/2013/05/31/us/warren-buffett-fast-facts", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "CNN Library", "contributors": [], "firstPublishDate": "2013-05-31T20:17:29Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-09-10T21:18:42Z", "headline": "Warren Buffett Fast Facts", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "body": "Here's a look at the life of Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

For the first time since her 2015 sexual assault, she is telling her story not from behind a curtain of anonymity, but as herself -- attributed and for the record -- in the aptly titled, \"Know My Name.\"  Turner loses appeal In releasing the book, says publisher Penguin Random House, Miller is reclaiming her identity. Her struggles with shame and isolation provide a microcosm into the oppression that sexual assault victims -- even those with supposedly \"perfect\" cases -- experience, it says. \"Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life,\" the publisher's summary says.  Miller, who now lives in San Francisco and holds a degree in literature from the University of California, Santa Barbara, is scheduled to appear on \"60 Minutes\" two days before the memoir's September 24 release.  For years, Miller withheld her identity following her sexual assault on the Stanford campus and a subsequent trial that led to her rapist serving several weeks of his six-month sentence. This, despite felony convictions on counts of intent to commit rape of an intoxicated/unconscious person, penetration of an intoxicated person and penetration of an unconscious person. Turner's treatment not uncommon Outrage erupted. Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky said Turner's age and lack of criminal history made the jail stint, plus probation, appropriate.  \"A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him,\" Persky said. \"I think he will not be a danger to others.\" On January 18, 2015, at about 1 a.m., Turner sexually assaulted Miller behind a Dumpster near an on-campus fraternity. He might have gotten away with it if not for two bicyclists who saw Turner on top of the unconscious 22-year-old and intervened.  In a 12-page impact statement that went viral, Miller said the attack left her \"closed off, angry, self-deprecating, tired, irritable, empty.\" She implored Persky to hand down a harsh sentence.  \"My life has been on hold for over a year, a year of anger, anguish and uncertainty, until a jury of my peers rendered a judgment that validated the injustices I had endured,\" she wrote in the impact statement. She went to a frat party, drank and woke up in a hospital with pine needles in her hair, only to undergo a lengthy forensic exam that left her feeling traumatized and humiliated, she wrote.  Op-ed: Show victim's letter to your sons \"I had multiple swabs inserted into my vagina and anus, needles for shots, pills, had a Nikon pointed right into my spread legs. I had long, pointed beaks inside me and had my vagina smeared with cold, blue paint to check for abrasions,\" she wrote.  In the shower later, she decided, \"I don't want my body anymore. I was terrified of it. I didn't know what had been in it, if it had been contaminated, who had touched it. I wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else.\" Still clutching to anonymity in the months after the sentence, she told her story for Glamour magazine, which named her its woman of the year. Miller described how she was \"struck silent\" by Persky's sentence  \"I was embarrassed for trying, for being led to believe I had any influence,\" she wrote.  Joe Biden pens letter to victim Miller's influence, however, turned out to be profound: Her case and her words spurred a change in California's sentencing law, a hard alcohol ban on Stanford's campus and in 2018 the ouster of Persky, who was resoundingly recalled by Santa Clara County voters. Her impact statement was also recited from the floor of the US House of Representatives.  Andrea Schulz, the editor in chief of Viking, which is owned by Penguin Random House, called Miller's memoir \"one of the most important books that I've ever published,\" in an interview with The New York Times. The power of Miller's impact statement demonstrated she had \"the brain and the voice of a writer from the very beginning,\" she said.  \"I jumped out of my chair to acquire it,\" Schulz told the paper, \"because it was just obvious to me from the beginning what she had to say and how different it was and how extraordinarily well she was going to say it.\" Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify and reflect that Turner was convicted of intent to commit rape of an intoxicated/unconscious person, penetration of an intoxicated person and penetration of an unconscious person.", "sourceId": "article_120CBF3A-08B2-4C61-7E44-FD03ECFF95A5", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/us/brock-turner-rape-victim-chanel-miller-book-emily-doe/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-09-04T18:31:54Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-09-06T18:20:56Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-09-06T18:20:56Z", "path": "/2019/09/04/us/brock-turner-rape-victim-chanel-miller-book-emily-doe", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Eliott C.

Hurricane Dorian The news out of the Bahamas is growing more grim. The death toll from Hurricane Dorian is up to 30, but hundreds of people are still missing. So, more body bags and coolers are being brought in. And officials are warning people to prepare for \"unimaginable information\" on the death toll. There is some good news, though. The US Coast Guard has rescued 201 people, while a British naval ship is giving\u00a0out food and water and clearing debris from streets. Meanwhile, Dorian is lingering\u00a0this morning just off the North Carolina coast, lashing that state and Virginia with rain, storm surges and strong winds. At least five people in the US have been killed by the storm, now a Category 1 hurricane. Dorian blew by South Carolina yesterday, leaving power outages, flooded streets and downed trees.

Mugabe, who was 95, ruled the country with an iron fist for more than three decades before getting pushed out of power two years ago in a coup. When he became the newly independent Zimbabwe's first prime minister in 1980, he was touted internationally as the hope of his nation. But he turned into a tyrannical leader who waged a campaign of oppression and violence to maintain power. He drove Zimbabwe, once known as southern Africa's breadbasket, into poverty. Read more about his complicated legacy here. 3. California boat fire The five crew members who survived that hellish Labor Day diving boat fire told investigators they did all they could to save their passengers. One crew member said he woke up to a noise and saw flames shooting up from the galley area. The guests' sleeping quarters were below the galley. After several unsuccessful attempts to save the passengers, crew members said they had to jump from the boat. Thirty-four people were killed in the fire. Thirty-three bodies have been recovered, while one remains missing. Here's what we know about the victims. 4. Ghost Ship warehouse fire trial A man on trial in one of the most deadly nightclub fires in US history was acquitted, while a jury couldn't reach a verdict for a second defendant. Max Harris was found not guilty of 36 counts of involuntary manslaughter in the 2016 blaze at the Ghost Ship warehouse in Oakland, California. Harris was the Ghost Ship's creative director. Jurors deadlocked over the second defendant, Derick Almena, the Ghost Ship's leaseholder. When the verdicts were read, family and friends of the people who died in the fire gasped and cried.   5. Student loan forgiveness If you have student debt and signed up for a loan forgiveness program, don't skip this story. A newly expanded government program intended to make it easier for borrowers to apply for forgiveness of their student loans rejected pretty much everyone who applied --\u00a0about 99% of applicants, according to a new report. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program -- established in 2007 and expanded in 2018 -- is supposed to help teachers, social workers and others who work in the public sector get their debt canceled after making 10 years' worth of payments. But borrowers say\u00a0the qualification requirements were complex and poorly communicated by loan servicers. Many\u00a0borrowers, after making 10 years of payments, found out they didn't have the right kind of federal student loan, were in the wrong repayment plan\u00a0or worked for an employer that didn't qualify for forgiveness.\u00a0 THIS JUST IN ...

warehouse but could not reach a verdict for the building's leaseholder. Max Harris was acquitted and Derick Almena's case ended in a hung jury. As the verdicts were read, there were noticeable gasps and tears from relatives and friends of those who died, CNN affiliate KPIX reported.  Prosecutors alleged Almena, the leaseholder, and Harris, who helped collect rent and acted as creative director for the art collective housed at the 10,000-square-foot facility, were responsible for the deaths resulting from the blaze.  \"We are eternally grateful for the verdict today,\" said Curtis Briggs,  an attorney for Harris. Briggs thanked the jury and the community in a press briefing. Briggs criticized the leadership in Oakland, urging reform. \"This isn't a time to celebrate for Max Harris, because this community is sick. This community is sick because the leadership is sick,\" Briggs said. Almena's attorney, Tony Serra, said he was \"distressed\" by the hung jury. According to CNN affiliate KGO, the jury was 10-2 in favor of conviction but could not break the deadlock. \"In the next trial, we will do better,\" Serra said. \"It may hang again, it may be acquitted, but we're not going to lose,\" he added. Almena and Harris faced up to 39 years in prison if the nine-woman, three-man jury found them guilty on all counts. Their trial began in May and deliberations began last month.  It was one of the deadliest nightclub fires in US history and the deadliest American nightclub fire since The Station in West Warwick, Rhode Island, erupted in flames in 2003.  Almena, 49, and Harris, 29, allowed more than two dozen people to live in the dilapidated building, stacked large quantities of flammable materials from floor to ceiling and deceived officials and building owners, prosecutors said in announcing the charges two years ago.  They also held music parties there. The fire came during one such event -- an electronic dance party on December 2, 2016. Three dozen people died because they could not escape the building. One of the warehouse's exits had been blocked, and the building was missing important safety features, such as fire alarms, marked exits and sprinklers, according to authorities.  Father of twins and teen choir member among victims The defendants' attorneys countered that arsonists set the fire, which their clients could not have prevented, and they presented a witness who testified she heard a group of between 14 and 19 men congratulating themselves on starting the blaze, CNN affiliate KPIX reported.  District Attorney Chief Assistant Kevin Dunleavy said Thursday the office will evaluate what do next regarding Almena. \"Our hearts have been with the families of the 36 victims that died in this unspeakable tragedy; that still remains our focus and that will be our focus going forward,\" he said.   A hearing for Almena has been scheduled for October 4. Plea deal tossed Last year, Almena and Harris pleaded no contest to 36 counts of involuntary manslaughter, and Alameda County assistant district attorney Teresa Drenick said the men would avoid trial and face sentencing in August 2018. Almena was expected to get nine years in prison, Harris six.  One of Almena's attorneys, Tony Serra, told reporters that the plea \"was an act of ethics and morality\" rather than a raw admission of guilt.  \"This was not a plea entered into because of legal necessity. We had from my perspective and from many lawyers' perspectives, we had viable defenses,\" Serra said, according to CNN affiliate KGO. \"This is a plea that's been entered into as a moral imperative to eliminate all the trauma and pain and suffering that everyone who touches this case endures.\" Previously, Almena had told an NBC morning show that he was \"incredibly sorry,\" while his attorneys had said the charges were a miscarriage of justice and an \"attempt to make a scapegoat out of our client.\" Warehouse hadn't been inspected in 30 years Before the men could be sentenced, however, Judge James Cramer nixed the deal after deciding that Almena had not shown sufficient remorse, according to CNN affiliate KRON. Defense lawyers tried to convince Cramer to reinstate it, but the judge -- who made his decision after hearing two days of testimony from grieving families -- would not budge, the station reported. At least one family member had expressed disappointment with the deal, saying that while victims' loved ones wanted to hear the men concede culpability, the proposed sentences felt insufficient.  \"We just wanted some justice, just not to be two years or four years with time served,\" said David Gregory, who lost his daughter, Michela, in the fire. \"We don't feel that, in our opinion, that was fair justice.\" The men also face civil lawsuits.

Hurricane Dorian Dorian strengthened to a Category 3 storm overnight as it crept\u00a0along the southeastern US coast. It's pummeling South Carolina this morning with winds well over 100 mph and flooding the city of Charleston. Anywhere from 15 to 20 inches of rain is predicted to fall along South Carolina's coast. More than 73,000 people in South Carolina and Georgia are without power right now. Dorian could make landfall late tonight\u00a0near Morehead City, North Carolina. Click here to get the latest on Dorian and to track the storm. And if you're in Dorian's path, use CNN's lite site for faster downloading. Meanwhile, down in the Bahamas, the damage left by Dorian is being discussed in apocalyptic terms. On the northern islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama, entire neighborhoods have been wiped out and the international airport was obliterated. That's really bad news because it'll make it that much harder to get relief and aid to those who need it. Dorian was the strongest hurricane on record to ever make landfall in the country, and\u00a0Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said it caused \"generational devastation.\" The death toll now stands at 20, but it will rise as searchers comb the islands to assess damage. Click here for photos of the destruction\u00a0and to find out how to help survivors. 2. Trade war Asian markets and US stock futures both jumped on the news that the US and China will return to the negotiating table to talk trade. The talks will resume early next month in Washington, and they will be the first face-to-face meeting of the two sides since the trade war's escalation over the past few weeks. The latest round of tariffs that both countries imposed on each other went into effect on Sunday. News of new talks will be welcome news to big businesses, which are starting to feel the bite from tariffs, and also to smaller companies that are truly suffering from them. 3. Brexit It was a day of double losses for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and it's left his plan to pull Britain out of the European Union in shambles. First, lawmakers, some from his own party, voted to stop Johnson from taking the UK out of the EU without a negotiated deal. That's the dreaded no-deal Brexit that most everyone agrees would be disastrous for the British economy. Then, Parliament shot down Johnson's demand for an early election. The PM had hoped a new vote would break the Brexit deadlock by returning him to power with a bigger majority. So, what does Johnson do now?\u00a0It's not clear, but he appears determined to keep the no-deal Brexit option alive. 4. Climate crisis CNN last night hosted a marathon of climate crisis town halls. Ten Democratic presidential hopefuls, over seven hours, laid out their plans to save the planet. Some of the big takeaways: \u2022 Kamala Harris said she would ditch the Senate filibuster to pass the Green New Deal. \u2022 Julian Castro pushed for \"new civil rights legislation\" to address environmental racism. \u2022 Beto O'Rourke said he would push to use federal funds to help people in flood-prone areas move to higher ground. \u2022 Pete Buttigieg believes fighting climate change might be harder than winning World War II. President Trump and others in the GOP mocked the candidates via Twitter, and that, says CNN political analyst Stephen Collinson, is why running on the climate crisis is something of a risk for Democrats. \"While going big on climate is the price of entry in their presidential race, it's yet to be proven as a shrewd general election strategy,\" Collinson says. Click here to read the 10 key lines and the best moments of the night. 5. Death rates Does the state you live in determine your lifespan?\u00a0That's impossible to determine, but a new report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics notes that death rates really are markedly higher in the five US states at the top of the list. Those states -- Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma and West Virginia -- had an average death rate 49% higher than that of the five states with the lowest death rates, which are California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota and New York. The leading causes of death were the same in states with high and low\u00a0death rates: heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, unintentional injuries and stroke.

It is a memorial to the 40 passengers and crew who died on United Flight 93 on September 11, 2001 near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.  Facts:\nThe memorial site is managed by the National Park Service. The memorial encompasses 2,200 acres and the \"Tower of Voices,\" a 93-foot-tall tower with 40 wind chimes.  Features include the Memorial Plaza, 40 Memorial Groves and the All\u00e9e, a formal walking path.  Timeline:\nSeptember 11, 2001 - United Airlines Flight 93, traveling from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco, crashes in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Hijackers were directing the plane towards Washington, DC, but were disrupted by passengers. All passengers, crew and four hijackers are killed. September 24, 2002 - The Flight 93 National Memorial Act is passed, creating the country's 386th national park.  September 7, 2005 - A design by Paul Murdoch Architects of Los Angeles, \"The Crescent of Embrace,\" is chosen for the memorial. A committee of 15 people, including family members of the victims, chose it out of more than 1,000 entries.  August 31, 2009 - Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announces the National Park Service has reached agreements with seven of eight landowners to purchase the land necessary for the memorial, at an estimated $9.5 million. The eighth parcel, owned by Svonavec, Inc., will be taken by eminent domain after an agreement cannot be reached. This parcel includes most of the crash site.  November 7, 2009 - The groundbreaking ceremony at the memorial site takes place.  September 10, 2011 - The first features of the Flight 93 National Memorial are dedicated and opened to the public. Vice President Joe Biden attends the ceremony.   September 11, 2011 - President Barack Obama participates in commemorations at the memorial site.  May 30, 2012 - The National Park Service completes the planting of the 40 Memorial Groves.   April 2013 - More than 500 volunteers plant 15,500 seedlings across 23 acres. Trees planted for reforestation in the area will serve as a windbreak for the trees in the Memorial Groves.  October 3, 2014 - A fire breaks out at the memorial, destroying the headquarters complex. Although most of the 60,000 tribute items are stored off-site, important items, including the flag that flew over the US Capitol on September 11, 2001, are destroyed. No initial cause of the fire is determined, but arson and foul play are ruled out. February 6, 2016 - The National Park Service releases a report with the findings of its investigation into the 2014 fire. Improperly discarded smoking material (possibly a cigarette), landscaping mulch too close to the building and flammable decking material may have fueled the fire but investigators were unable to determine exactly how the blaze started. More than 300 photographs and 25 personal mementos were lost in the fire.   September 9, 2018 - The National Park Service hosts the official dedication ceremony of the Tower of Voices.

statement on Twitter Saturday:  Democratic candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro also released a series of tweets saying \"We have to be more honest with ourselves. This is going to happen again. And again.\"  Sen. Elizabeth Warren called out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.  Former vice president Joe Biden said \"we must end this epidemic.\"  Sen. Kamala Harris said in a series of tweets she's \"sick of this\" and that \"Our children deserve a future without multiple mass shootings in one month.\" Sen. Cory Booker said he'd take \"executive action to reduce gun violence\" beginning his first day in the White House.  Sen. Michael Bennet tweeted \"West Texas has had enough heartbreak.\"  New York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted the cyle of mass shootings and waiting on the news cycle must end.  Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said the shooting in Alabama that left 10 injured and the West Texas shooting were \"not normal.\"  Candidate John Delaney tweeted \"people deserve to be safe driving down the highway, going to church, going to school, everywhere.\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar said the playbook of broken promises and meetings needs to end.  Candidates Pete Buttigieg, Wayne Messam, Tim Ryan, Joe Sestak, Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang also released statements on Twitter.  The Ector County Independent School District tweeted Saturday that one of its students was killed in Saturday's shooting. The school district is based in Odessa, Texas \"ECISD counselors as well as counselors from the region are preparing to help our staff, our students,\" the district tweeted.  A 17-month-old girl was injured in the West Texas shooting Saturday, according to University Medical Center spokesman Eric Finley. UMC is in Lubbock, Texas.  The toddler is in satisfactory condition, Finley said.  Finley declined to comment on the nature of the girl's injuries.  Authorities believe they have positively identified the person responsible for today\u2019s shootings in West Texas, a law enforcement official familiar with the ongoing investigation told CNN.  Local authorities are currently seeking court authorization to search an address associated with the identified shooter. FBI resources from the bureau\u2019s offices in Dallas, San Antonio and El Paso are en route to the Midland area to assist with the investigation of Saturday's mass shooting, a law enforcement source told CNN.  The resources include forensic examiners who will assist local investigators in processing multiple crime scenes associated with the shooting, the official said. This is the second mass shooting in Texas in August. Only four weeks ago, a gunman killed 22 people in a mass shooting in El Paso, about 285 miles west of Odessa.\u00a0 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo released a statement on the West Texas shooting Saturday: How many more families will lose loved ones, how many more communities will be torn apart? How many more tragedies will it take before \"leaders\" act?\nThe bloodshed must end now.\n\u00a0DO SOMETHING. \u00a0 Department of Public Safety troopers were trying to stop the shooting suspect's vehicle because of a \"traffic violation,\" DPS Lt. Elizabeth Carter told CNN.  It's not clear what the traffic violation was, Carter said.  She said that prior to coming to a complete stop, the suspect fired several shots at the DPS patrol unit, injuring one of the officers.  The trooper is in serious but stable condition, Carter said.  The suspect also shot a Midland police officer and an Odessa police officer, both of whom are in stable condition.  The suspect in Saturday's West Texas shooting was armed with a rifle, according to Texas Department of Public Safety Lt. Elizabeth Carter.\u00a0 According to Carter, the DPS trooper who was shot is in serious but stable condition. The Midland and Odessa police officers who were shot are also in stable condition at the hospital. Russell Tippin, CEO of Medical Center Health System\u00a0in Odessa, told reporters Saturday that 13 people arrived at the center after the shooting.  Of the 13, two were treated and released, Tippin said. One of the patients was a child younger than 2 who was flown to a pediatric center in either Lubbock or Dallas, a hospital official said.  Seven patients are in critical condition, meaning they've gone through or have been released from surgery. Two are in serious condition and one died.  The shootings in West Texas took place a day before a series of new state laws easing gun restrictions were set to take effect.  The new laws were passed in August and will go into effect Sunday, September 1.  Among the new laws:   House Bill 1143\u00a0says a school district cannot prohibit licensed gun owners, including school employees, from storing a firearm or ammunition in a locked vehicle on a school parking lot -- provided they are not in plain view.\nSenate Bill 535\u00a0clarifies the possession of firearms at churches, synagogues or other places of worship. It allows licensed handgun owners to legally carry their weapons in places of worship.\nHouse Bill 1387\u00a0loosens restrictions on how many armed school marshals a school district can appoint.\nHouse Bill 302\u00a0bans homeowners or landlords of rental property from prohibiting residents from lawfully possessing, carrying, transporting or storing a firearm or ammunition on the property.\nHouse Bill\u00a01177 prohibits\u00a0residents from being charged with a crime for carrying a handgun while evacuating from a state or local disaster area.\nHouse Bill 2363 allows some foster homes to store firearms and ammunition in a safe, locked and secure place for personal protection. The NRA\u00a0informed their members\u00a0of the new laws on Thursday, stating that the bills were \u201cprotecting your second amendment rights.\u201d Speaking to reporters before boarding a plane for Poland on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence addressed the shootings in West Texas: \"Our hearts go out to all the victims and families who had loved ones lose their lives. We commend the law enforcement in Odessa for their swift and courageous response, but at the President\u2019s direction we\u2019ve deployed the full resources of the federal government. They\u2019re on site. The president spoke to the attorney general. The FBI is already assisting local law enforcement in the investigation going forward.\" Pence said he and the Trump administration \"remain absolutely determined to work with leaders in both parties in Congress to take steps that we can address and confront this scourge of mass atrocity in our country.\" Cinergy Entertainment Group, which operates the theater where police shot and killed a suspect, released a statement on the West Texas shooting:  \u201cOur hearts and prayers go out to the victims and the families of this senseless tragedy.\u00a0The safety of our team members and guest are our top priority.\u00a0We are grateful for the swift response from local authorities and first responders throughout the Midland/Odessa community.\u00a0Even though we avoided crisis within our facility, we will continue to work with law enforcement to provide any help they may need.\u00a0Please refer all additional questions to the proper local, state and/or federal authorities.\u201d Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke said earlier Saturday that the shooting suspect was shot and killed outside a Cinergy movie theater in Odessa.

Alex Woods recorded video of the shootout between police and a suspect outside of the Cinergy movie theater in Odessa. \u201cWhen we had arrived about five minutes before the shooting had begun, I had\u00a0no clue the shooter\u00a0was even there,\u201d Woods told CNN. \u201cThere was just police everywhere and there was a bunch of people behind the theater in the field walking and next thing you know this gunfire is going off.\u201d \u201cNext thing you know, I\u00a0hear\u00a0a pop, so, I flip the camera to where the theaters\u00a0at\u00a0and I just see a bunch of gunfire going off,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI could see the officer walking up\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0mail van\u00a0and discharging his weapon into it, and I believe\u00a0that is when the shooter was killed.\" Woods said it was a very surreal moment. \u201cI never thought it would happen in life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just all happened so quickly.\u201d There are currently 14 victims being treated at Medical Center Hospital in Odessa, according to CEO Russell\u00a0Tippin.\u00a0No ages or conditions were provided.\u00a0 The hospital has a family staging area with grief counselors and social workers to provide support, Tippin said. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton released a statement on Twitter, in which he expressed his horror and thanked first responders. Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke said the suspect of the Midland-Odessa shootings was a white male in his mid-30s.  The incident began at 3:17 p.m. CDT, when a Department of Public Safety officer attempted to make a traffic stop on a gold Honda, Gerke said. When the vehicle came to a stop, the occupant shot the officer. The vehicle drove westbound into Odessa, where another person was shot. The suspect continued through Odessa to 42nd Street, where Gerke said \"there were multiple victims.\"  The suspect abandoned his vehicle and stole a USPS mail truck, Gerke said. There were other victims after that, he added. The suspect then drove eastbound toward the Cinergy movie theater, where he and officers exchanged fire.

I thank the first responders who have acted swiftly and admirably under pressure, and I want to remind all Texans that we will not allow the Lone Star State to be overrun by hatred and violence. We will unite, as Texans always do, to respond to this tragedy.\u201d Abbott will be traveling to Odessa Sunday morning.  A law enforcement official told CNN that agents from the FBI\u2019s Midland office are assisting law enforcement with their response to the shootings. The Midland office is a satellite of the FBI\u2019s El Paso division. A witness inside a restaurant on 42nd Street in Odessa filmed officers in tactical gear preparing to respond to the shootings.  \u00a0 Midland Memorial Hospital is currently on lockdown, and treating patients following the shooting in Odessa and Midland, according to a post on their Facebook page.

Hurricane Dorian continues to strengthen on Friday night, with maximum sustained winds of up to 140 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.  Dorian is currently located 545 miles east of West Palm Beach and is moving west-northwest at 10 mph.\u00a0 The forecast calls for Dorian to reach the Florida coast near Melbourne on Tuesday, but does not bring the center of the storm over mainland Florida, instead it moves along the coast northward toward Jacksonville.\u00a0 The forecast calls for additional strengthening of up to 150 mph tomorrow. Category 5 winds are from 157 mph and higher.\u00a0 The city of Miami Beach will be opening two sandbag distribution sites for residents Saturday and Sunday.  The locations will be at South Beach (451 Dade Boulevard) and North Beach (80 Street and Collins Avenue parking lot). Residents going to both locations are required to show proof of residency via government-issued ID or utility bill.  Both locations will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday until the weather worsens or the sand supply runs out. Orange County will open 12 emergency shelters/evacuation centers on Sunday at 8 a.m. ahead of Hurricane Dorian. The county urged residents to not arrive before the centers open.

Dorian has strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane with maximum winds of 130 mph. This is a special update from the National Hurricane Center, based on new reports from NOAA's hurricane hunter aircraft.\u00a0 Chevron is evacuating nonessential personnel from oil production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a statement from the company:  \u201cNonessential personnel are being evacuated from our Petronius and Blind Faith facilities, but production from all Chevron-operated Gulf of Mexico assets remains at normal levels.\u00a0 As part of our hurricane preparedness procedures, we have a fuel supply strategy team monitoring inventory availability by location, scheduling and staging resupply. Chevron and Texaco stations are independently owned and operated in the US Southeast region. We have been supplying as much fuel as possible in advance of the storm.\u00a0 We also proactively communicated that Chevron has a\u00a0zero-tolerance policy\u00a0for unlawful price gouging, which goes directly against our values as a company. While we are not able to control the pricing of individually owned and operated facilities, our branded fuel supply agreements do require that station owners and/or operators comply with all laws during a State of Emergency.\u00a0 The Chevron Pascagoula refinery in Mississippi is currently following hurricane procedures and paying close attention to the track and forecast of the storm.\u201d Dorian continues to strengthen and is likely to become a Category 4 hurricane late Friday or early Saturday, according to an 8 p.m. advisory from the National Hurricane Center.   It's currently a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph.  Dorian is likely to remain a very intense and dangerous hurricane as it moves through the Bahamas toward Florida's east coast.   Broward County officials\u00a0said its school district will cancel all weekend activities so schools can be re-purposed as shelters in case evacuations are needed. There have been no evacuations issued, but the county is reminding residents to be ready. Martin County officials told reporters they plan to issue a mandatory evacuation order at 10 a.m. Sunday if Hurricane Dorian stays on track.  Martin County is on Florida's eastern coast just south of Port St. Lucie. Fire Services Chief Bill Schobel said that the evacuation plan depends on how the storm develops, pointing out that Hurricane Dorian has significantly changed course multiple times in the last 24 hours and so it depends on what happens in the next 72 hours. \u201cIf we have to regroup and change the mandatory evacuation times, we\u2019ll do that. The last thing we want to do is dislocate people unnecessarily,\u201d Sheriff William Snyder said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to follow God\u2019s script. Wherever that hurricane goes, we\u2019re going to adjust accordingly.\u201d President Trump says he will attend a hurricane briefing Sunday at Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington at 12:30 p.m. ET. He says that will be roughly 24 hours before storm is expected to hit, and they will likely make decisions about whether to evacuate parts of Florida then.\u00a0 He said he spoke to Sens. Rick Scott, Marco Rubio and other officials throughout the day.\u00a0 St. Lucie County\u00a0officials warned residents to watch out for crimes of opportunity as the hurricane approaches. Officials said that anyone who is arrested for a crime of opportunity during the storm will be held without bail. Officials warned residents to shelter in place in their homes, if they can. The county said that they will have shelters available but want to make sure that those that evacuate their homes get access to the shelters. Currently, there are no evacuations in the county, but officials are warning residents to be ready in case an evacuation is ordered. Florida Power & Light says it has mobilized a workforce of more than 16,000 to work on power restoration after Dorian hits. FPL says the workers are pre-positioned at 24 staging sites and the company has plans for thousands more if needed. The power company is urging customers to be prepared and take safety precautions ahead of the storm in case of power outages, downed power lines and debris. Walt Disney World Communications released a statement Friday about their operations as Hurricane Dorian approaches:  \u201cWalt Disney World Resort is operating under normal conditions. We are closely monitoring the path of the projected weather, as nothing is more important than the safety of our\u00a0guests and Cast Members.\u00a0We are taking precautions including canceling weekend sporting events and closing Disney\u2019s Blizzard Beach Water Park on Sunday.\u00a0We are also contacting guests with current and upcoming reservations at Disney\u2019s Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground,\u00a0Copper Creek Cabins at Disney\u2019s Wilderness Lodge, Treehouse Villas at Disney\u2019s Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa and the Bungalows at Disney\u2019s Polynesian Village Resort to plan for anticipated weather impacts.\u201d Orlando International Airport will cease commercial flight operations on Monday, September 2, at 2 a.m., according to a press release from the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority. \u201cHurricane Dorian has strengthened and slowed. Our plan currently is to run full operations through Sunday,\u201d said Phil Brown, CEO of the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority chief. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly where Dorian is going but we do know that it will have a significant impact on the entire state of Florida. So in order to allow the airport\u2019s 25 thousand employees time to secure their homes and families we feel it is prudent to cease operations in a timely fashion.\u201d A hurricane warning is in effect for the northwestern Bahamas, according to a 5 p.m. advisory from the National Hurricane Center.  A hurricane watch is in effect for Andros Island.  Bahamian\u00a0Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said at a press conference in Nassau that evacuation orders have been issued for multiple locations.  CNN has previously reported that the Minnis ordered emergency evacuations for residents from the northern Keys of Abaco to mainland Abaco. Additional evacuation orders have been issued for parts of Grand Bahama island.\u00a0Grand Bahama is divided into the districts of East Grand Bahama and West Grand Bahama, as well as the Freeport Bonded Area. In East Grand Bahama, the following settlements must evacuate:\u00a0Sweeting\u2019s Cay, Water Cay, Gold Rock Creek North and South, Freetown, Pelican Point, Rocky Creek, McLean\u2019s Town, Grand Cay, Deep Water Cay, and Queen\u2019s Cove. In West Grand Bahama, evacuations have been ordered for the settlements of West End, Bottle Bay and Bahama Beach. The Florida attorney general's office says it has received more than 1,000 calls of alleged price gouging, with most of the reports concerning bottled water and gas.  The most credible allegations are handled immediately by a rapid response team in the field or consumer protection investigators, according to the attorney general\u2019s\u00a0office.  If Hurricane Dorian hits Florida as forecast, it will be the fourth straight year a hurricane has struck the state, something that hasn't happened since the 1940s. Floridians need to prepare for Hurricane Dorian if they haven't already, Gov. Ron DeSantis said at the Orange County Emergency Operations Center where he was briefed about the storm. \u201cWe anticipate a lot of rain. Losing power is big probability also. If you\u2019re in an area prone to flooding, you\u2019re likely to see that with this storm,\u201d he said.  DeSantis said Florida Power & Light has brought in 14,000 workers from other states and pre-positioned them across the state so they can restore power as soon as the storm passes. \u201cYou should assume there is going to be power loss if you\u2019re in the path of this storm,\u201d he said. DeSantis said there are no evacuations in Florida at this time, but if and when they are ordered, people should listen. \u201cIf you\u2019re in an evacuation zone and told to evacuate you need to heed that call and protect yourself and your family,\" DeSantis said. Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alem\u00e1n captured photos of flooding on Friday. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not raining and I\u2019m standing in 6 inches of water just based on a king tide and some minor rain. Imagine how these neighbors must be concerned about flooding and evacuation for a tropical storm or hurricane,\u201d Alem\u00e1n said in a Facebook post. The flooding is due to the beginning of\u00a0Florida's king tides, a term that refers to the highest tides in any given period. These high tides follow a cycle \u2014 after all, tides are caused by the moon and follow a predictable pattern. Florida Keys officials are asking visitors to leave the Keys if possible, ahead of Hurricane Dorian Officials said they are not ordering a mandatory visitor evacuation and lodging properties can remain open. \"Guests who choose to stay in the Keys should be aware that weather conditions are likely to deteriorate Sunday and may remain that way through Wednesday, given the latest forecast,\" officials said in a press release. Officials said that the most significant concern is flooding in the low-lying areas in the Upper Keys. A team from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Aircraft Operations Center flew into the center of Hurricane Dorian's eye. The center of the storm. If you are in the eye, you can see\u00a0the stadium effect \u2014 where the clouds stack up like a stadium. It is the calmest part of the storm. You can even see blue sky during the day and stars at night Here's a look at the video the team took while flying through the eye: Federal officials are preparing for \u201ca major impact\u201d from Hurricane Dorian and are planning a two-prong plan for staging responders in different parts of Florida, according to FEMA Associate Administrator Jeffrey Byard.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe are looking in coordination with the state, kind of attacking this storm, if you will, from two prongs,\u201d Byard told reporters on a conference call Friday.\u00a0 Here's how he explained the two parts: He said FEMA will have resources in the southern part of the state that can then follow the storm if it should hit central \n\"We\u2019ll definitely have resources in the northern part of the state that can collapse down,\" he added. With landfall several days out, Byard noted there is \u201cuncertainty\u201d and that the agency is preparing for \u201ca multi-state impact\u201d should the impact stretch northward \u201cinto Georgia and the Carolinas.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 office has released a list of school districts, colleges and universities that are canceling classes ahead of Hurricane Dorian. These are the school districts that have announced closures: Gulf County\u00a0will be closed on Tuesday.\nLake County\u00a0will be closed on Tuesday and Wednesday.\u00a0\nBrevard County\u00a0will be closed on Tuesday.\nMartin County\u00a0will dismiss students early on Friday and be closed on Tuesday.\nMiami-Dade\u00a0adult education classes will be cancelled starting at 6:00 p.m. on Friday.\nOrange County\u00a0will be closed on Tuesday.\nOsceola County\u00a0will be closed on Tuesday.\nSeminole County\u00a0will be closed on Tuesday.\nSt. Lucie\u00a0will have early dismissal on Friday.\nVolusia County\u00a0will be closed on Tuesday.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been briefing by the director of the Division of Emergency Management and a state meteorologist. Here are the key takeaways: \u00a0 No evacuations have been ordered at this time.\nThree FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Teams are on standby.\nTennessee is sending six swift water rescue teams in preparation of the storm.\nThe Florida Highway Patrol is conducting a mission to provide various fuel escorts to communities in need at this time.\nFlorida transit officials have announced that the I-595 Express lanes will operate in the westbound direction beginning at 3 p.m. ET today until Hurricane Dorian has passed. Eastbound traffic will continue to use the general-purpose eastbound lanes throughout this period Hurricane Dorian is currently a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph.\u00a0 But the forecast indicates Dorian may be a Category 4 hurricane \u2014 with winds from 130 to 156 mph \u2014 when it strikes. Here's why that matters: Meteorologists use the\u00a0Saffir Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale\u00a0to measure a hurricane's strength. The system divides storms into five categories: Category 1: Winds 74 to 95 mph (Minor damage)\nCategory 2: Winds 96 to 110 mph (Extensive damage \u2014 Can uproot trees and break windows)\nCategory 3: Winds 111 to 129 mph (Devastating \u2014 Can break windows\u00a0and\u00a0doors)\nCategory 4: Winds 130 to 156 mph (Catastrophic damage \u2014 Can tear off roofs)\nCategory 5: Winds 157 mph or higher (The absolute worst and can level houses and destroy buildings) This is what each category of a hurricane looks like: Hurricane Dorian continues to strengthen in the Atlantic Ocean, with winds increasing up to 115 mph, making Dorian a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  Hurricanes that are Category 3 or higher are considered major hurricanes. Dorian is located 625 miles east of West Palm Beach Florida and moving northwest at 10 mph.\u00a0 More about categories:\u00a0Meteorologists use the\u00a0Saffir Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale\u00a0to measure a hurricane's strength. The system divides storms into five categories: Category 1: Winds 74 to 95 mph\nCategory 2: Winds 96 to 110 mph \nCategory 3: Winds 111 to 129 mph \nCategory 4: Winds 130 to 156 mph \nCategory 5: Winds 157 mph or higher  Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis urged Bahamians living in vulnerable areas to not be \u201cfoolish\u201d and try to ride out Hurricane Dorian.  \u201cDon\u2019t put your life and those love ones\u00a0unnecessary risk. I urge you: Do not be foolish and try to brave out this hurricane,\" he said.\u00a0 He said people need to evacuate as emergency personnel can\u2019t be expected to risk their own lives to rescue them.\u00a0 \u201cLet me be externally very clear: Those who refuse to evacuate place themselves in great danger from very powerful and potentially life-threatening hurricane.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Minnis said he and his cabinet met with agency officials on Thursday night \u201cto map out the way forward.\"  The Bahamian prime minister announced all government offices are closed as of noon Friday. Every county in Florida is under a state of emergency as the state prepares for what may be the strongest hurricane to hit its east coast in nearly three decades. Dorian \u2014 which is currently a Category 2 storm \u2014 is forecast to make landfall as a\u00a0Category 4\u00a0storm on Monday, with sustained winds of around 130 mph. If that forecast holds, it will be the strongest hurricane to strike Florida's East Coast since Andrew in 1992, according to CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller.  Hurricane Andrew \u2014 which formed on Aug. 16 1992, and lasted until Aug. 28 \u2014 was originally believed to be a Category 4 storm, but was reclassified in 2005 as a Category 5. The direct death toll was 26 people \u2014 23 in the United States and three in the Bahamas. Its path included northwestern Bahamas, Florida and Louisiana, and it caused between $25 and $27 billion in damage. At least 25 members of the New York City Fire Department's Incident Management Team will head to New York on Sunday to help with hurricane logistics, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and Fire Commissioner Daniel A. Nigro announced today. \u201cNew York City is ready to do whatever it takes to help those impacted by Hurricane Dorian,\u201d said\u00a0de Blasio said in a statement. \u201cWe are actively monitoring the situation in Florida and the FDNY Incident Management team will be assisting and coordinating with local first responders to ensure they have the support they need in the coming days.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 Dorian is currently spinning in the Atlantic Ocean with winds up to 110 mph.\u00a0 So far, the storm has swept across the British and US Virgin Islands and whipped Puerto Rico with rain. It's expected to get even stronger over the next few days \u2014 with winds reaching up to about 130 mph \u2014 though it will likely slow down before it hits. If Dorian continues on\u00a0its current forecast, it will smack Grand Bahama island on Sunday before it makes landfall in Florida on Monday.  Remember: We're still a few days out, so the storm could land anywhere from the Florida Keys to southeast Georgia. CNN meteorologist Judson Jones predicted on Thursday that it could be between the Space Coast and West Palm Beach. You can track the path of the storm\u00a0here. Cape Canaveral's Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex will be closed Sunday and Monday to prepare for Hurricane Dorian.\u00a0 On Saturday, the visitor center will be open during regular operating hours of 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET. Kennedy Space Center Bus Tours to the Apollo/Saturn V Center will be available until 2:30 p.m. Special Interest Tours will not be available.\u00a0 During this closure, visitors will not be permitted onto visitor complex grounds, the space center said in a news release.

Trump's actions \"authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts,\" the White House said in a statement. Here's the full statement: Broward County Mayor Mark Bogen said a local state of emergency in Broward County will be declared this afternoon.\u00a0 Declaring a local state of emergency, Bogen said, allows for local officials to call for an evacuation order and declare curfews, if needed. Bogen said no evacuation orders have been announced at this\u00a0time, and county officials continue to monitor closely Dorian's track.\u00a0\u00a0 All school events in Broward County have been canceled Saturday through Monday, according to Broward County Public Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie.\u00a0 Runcie said the school district would continue to amend/ update any potential closures for next week.\u00a0 Marion Wilkinson Scott lives in Miami with his wife and two daughters.\u00a0 He posted on Twitter a picture of a car left over night at a gas station in West Kendall, with a letter on the dash: \"My name is ____. I live close by. My car is out of gas. Please call me when more arrives! Tel: ____.\" Scott told CNN he feels apprehensive over Hurricane Dorian approaching Florida.\u00a0 \u201cWe stocked up last week when it was a tropical storm and have reservations for a hurricane-proof hotel with generator in Bonita Springs,\u201d he said\u00a0 He said he's worried about his two young daughters. \u201cI have two little girls. I don't need for them to be in the heat once the electricity goes. We have shutters on our home. I'm glad we filled or tanks last week and have provisions. It is difficult to heed warnings when there is no gas at the station and no water in the market. Our tub will be filled.\u201d \u201cWe are people of faith. We went to the church to pray,\u201d he added. In preparation for Hurricane Dorian, Lyft is storing all its scooters starting at noon today, per requirements from the City of Miami, according to Lyft spokesperson Kaityln Carl. Each of the 244 scooters will be picked up by Lyft's operations team and will be secured in a warehouse.\u00a0 \"The safety of our community is fundamental to Lyft,\" Carl said. \"We will resume operations only once conditions improve and will continue to follow the guidance provided by the City of Miami.\" Bird, another e-scooter company, provided CNN with the following statement: \"In anticipation of Hurricane Dorian we're working closely with city officials and local authorities and have a team closely dedicated to monitoring weather conditions. We are collecting and safely storing our scooters in the City of Miami.\" Hurricane Dorian is still a Category 2 storm with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center's 11 a.m. ET advisory. To become a Category 3 storm, Dorian needs maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph. Category 3 hurricanes and up are considered major storms. Forecasters believe Dorian will be a Category 4 hurricane by the time it makes landfall in Florida. \"Dorian is expected to become an extremely dangerous major hurricane soon with additional strengthening likely as it heads for the northwestern Bahamas and the Florida Peninsula,\" the center said in the advisory. Here's a look at the latest predicted track: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shared a satellite image of the lightning strikes associated with Hurricane Dorian. As of Friday morning, the storm is a Category 2 hurricane, but is expected to make landfall as a Category 4.  The image captures strikes from this morning. \"Take a look at all that lightning!\" the agency tweeted. In the most recent visible satellite imagery, you can see an eye beginning to emerge in the center of Hurricane Dorian.\u00a0 What this means: The eye is the storm. If you are in the eye, you can see\u00a0the stadium effect \u2014 where the clouds stack up like a stadium. The formation of an eye is an indication that Dorian is intensifying and becoming better organized. Here's a look at the emerging eye: Norwegian Cruise Line has changed the itineraries for its Norwegian Breakaway, Norwegian Sky, and Norwegian Sun ships ahead of Hurricane Dorian's landfall.  Here's how the schedules have shifted: Norwegian Breakaway  For the cruise sailing on Aug. 25\nAs scheduled, Norwegian Breakaway will call to Cozumel, Mexico, on Friday.\u00a0At this time, the company is uncertain if the ship will be able to return to Miami, Florida, on Sunday as planned.\u00a0As such, the ship will extend its time and overnight in Cozumel until Sunday, departing at 5 p.m. During this time, guests will have the option to conclude their cruise and arrange their return home or remain on board. Guests who choose to end their cruise in Cozumel will receive a 25% future cruise credit.\nThe company asks guests to remain on board and will provide an update on the anticipated return date to Miami by 8 p.m. or sooner on Friday.\nFor the cruise sailing on Sept. 1\nNorwegian is monitoring the storm and will provide an update by 8 p.m. or sooner Friday. Norwegian Sky  For the cruise sailing on Aug. 26\nNorwegian Sky will no longer call to Great Stirrup Cay, Bahamas, and instead will return to Miami, Florida, a day early on Friday.\u00a0Guests will have the opportunity to remain on board until 7 a.m. on Saturday.\u00a0Due to the shortened cruise, all guests will receive a 20% refund from the original cruise fare paid.\u00a0\nFor the cruise sailing on August 31\nThe company is monitoring the storm and will provide an update by 3 p.m. or sooner on Friday. Norwegian Sun  Norwegian Sun departed from Port Canaveral, Florida, on Thursday, as scheduled.\u00a0Her calls to Nassau, Great Stirrup Cay, and Freeport, Bahamas, have been cancelled.\u00a0Instead, the ship will spend a day at sea on Friday, August 30, and will call to Cozumel, Mexico, on Saturday. The ship will remain at sea on Sunday and is scheduled to return to Port Canaveral on Monday.\nGuests who booked shore excursions for any of the original ports of call through our shore\u00a0excursion team, will receive a refund credited to their onboard account.\u00a0 NASA has moved a launch platform at Kennedy Space Center ahead of Hurricane Dorian, Gregory Harland, a spokesperson for the space center, said. The Mobile Launch Platform left Launch Pad 39B at 6 a.m. today. It's being moved 3.5 miles away to the Vehicle Assembly Building. The platform cost $650 million and is the only one available for the Space Launch System, which will eventually take NASA back to the moon and ultimately to Mars. Once secured, the Kennedy Space Center will have a skeleton staff on site throughout the storm, Harland added. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis acknowledged that there is a fuel shortage across state as Hurricane Dorian approaches. DeSantis said they are taking steps to fix this issue. \u201cWe, in the emergency declaration, waived service and truck rates for fuel trucks so we can increase capacity for fuel being brought in. We're also going to be starting today implementing Florida Highway Patrol escorts for fuel trucks so we can increase fueling in critical parts of the state.\u201d DeSantis said.\u00a0 During a morning briefing, DeSantis added that because of the decreased speed of the storm, they are expecting Dorian to be \u201cmulti-day\u201d event. There are at least nine Trump Organization-owned and Trump personally owned properties in South Florida that are in the path of Hurricane Dorian.  There are no evacuation orders in place yet, but CNN has reached out to the Trump Organization for updates on whether they plan to close any of the properties. \u201cBe prepared and please follow State and Federal instructions, it will be a very big Hurricane, perhaps one of the biggest!\u201d President Trump\u00a0tweeted\u00a0Thursday morning. \u00a0In addition to his property ownership, Trump has said he considers Florida home. \u201cI am thrilled to be back in my second home. That's what it is. It's my second home. In many cases, I think I could say it's my first home, if you want to know the truth. It's the great state of Florida,\u201d he said during a June campaign rally in Orlando. As Florida braced for Hurricane Irma in 2017, Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago property closed for hurricane preparations following a mandatory evacuation order. Here's a list of the properties:\u00a0 Trump Towers in\u00a0Sunny Isles Beach, Florida\nTrump National Doral \nTrump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida\nTrump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach \nTrump Hollywood\u00a0Hollywood Beach, Florida\nTrump Grande\u00a0in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida \nMar-A-Lago\u00a0\nTwo private homes in West Palm Beach\u00a0 At least nine colleges and universities are closing their campuses ahead of Hurricane Dorian, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced at a news conference moments ago. The following schools will be closed starting today through Tuesday: Daytona State College\nEastern\u00a0Florida State College\nIndian\u00a0River State College\nValencia College\nSeminole\u00a0State College\nFlorida Atlantic University\nFlorida Polytechnic University \nFlorida International University\nThe University of\u00a0Central Florida  Watch more: Florida Gov.\u00a0Ron\u00a0DeSantis will hold a news conference in Tallahassee about Hurricane Dorian at 9 a.m. ET. Every Florida county is under a state of emergency as storm preparations continue.  Right now, Dorian is a Category 2 storm, but it's expected to intensify before making landfall. If it hits as a\u00a0Category 4\u00a0storm on Monday, it will be the strongest hurricane to strike Florida's East Coast since Andrew in 1992, according to CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller.  With Hurricane Dorian expected to slam Florida on Labor Day, vacationers at Disney World and Universal Orlando should begin preparing now.  This advice comes from Robert Niles, editor of Theme Park Insider, who told CNN that these parks have detailed plans for riding out hurricanes, which have been activated several times in the past.  If hurricane-force winds threaten the parks, they will close, Niles said. So far, Disney and Universal have not issued press releases about park operations duirng the storm. The best thing tourists can do in the case of a hurricane is to avoid or leave that area, Niles said. \"It's not so much getting through the storm itself as enduing the aftermath. As a tourist, you don't need to be taking up resources that locals need to recover. That said, if you've spent a lot of money on a Disney vacation, they will do their best to take care of you while you are here \u2014 storm or no. Just do follow instructions from the resort.\" Niles encourages vacationers to stock up on bottled water and shelf-stable food and get a full tank of gas before the storm hits.  \u00a0 Florida Power and Light has activated its emergency response plan for Hurricane Dorian, according to a press release from the company. \u00a0Here are some steps the company is taking: Nearly 13,000 Florida Power and Light employees and additional personnel are ready to help restore power.\nThe company said it is working with utilities nationwide to get extra crews and equipment ahead of landfall.\nThe company is urging customers to make preparations now. Customers can download the Florida Power and Light app by texting the word \"App\" to 69375. Windermere, Florida, resident Dango Kumwenda said he waited in line for almost two hours to pump gas at a local station.  Kumwenda posted a video of long lines of cars waiting to fill their cars at the Winter Garden Wawa gas station to his Twitter account. \u201cThis was probably the only gas station within like a 10-mile radius with gas,\u201d he told CNN.\u00a0 The 24-year-old, who works as a personal loan specialist, said this is his first storm. He moved to Florida about three months ago.  \u201cI\u2019m not really sure how to feel about it, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t worried, but everyone else around here feels like they can ride it out so it\u2019s putting me at ease a little bit.\u201d Kumwenda also posted a picture of empty shelves at the local Walmart. Take a look: The National Hurricane Center just released its 8 a.m. ET advisory for Hurricane Dorian. The storm is still a Category 2 with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph. To become a Category 3 storm, Dorian needs maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph. Category 3 hurricanes and up are considered major storms. Here's the latest forecast from the center: As Dorian approaches, Universal Studios says they are open for business.  The Orlando, Florida, theme park said in a statement that they are closely monitoring the hurricane. Planning a trip? Universal will continue to update their website, www.universalorlando.com, with any additional updates as they receive them. The government of the Bahamas has issued hurricane watches for the northwestern Bahamas, including the capital, Nassau, as the risk of life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds this weekend continues to increase for this area. \u00a0 A hurricane watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within 48 hours.  The official forecast track has the storm passing directly over Great Abaco and Grand Bahama island Sunday into early Monday morning. Atlanta Motor Speedway is opening its camping facilities to evacuees seeking refuge from Hurricane Dorian. The Speedway, which is equipped to handle thousands of campers during its annual NASCAR weekend, will provide camping space free of charge for RV and tent campers in its Legends Campground. Located next to the camp sites, AMS will also open the Rinnai Shower Station camper bath house, allowing evacuees free access to hot showers and restroom facilities during their stay. Over the last few years, Atlanta Motor Speedway has opened its grounds to hundreds of people seeking refuge from powerful storms. During Hurricane Irma in 2017, the Speedway hosted more than 100 campers; in 2018 dozens more stayed in the Speedway's camping areas during Hurricanes Florence and Michael. \"Our facility is uniquely suited for just this type of situation and making space available for people seeking refuge from hurricanes and other natural disasters is simply the right thing to do,\" Executive Vice President and General Manager Brandon Hutchison said.  A limited number of camping spaces with water, power and sewer are also available for a nominal fee of $20 per night in the Premier Campground.  Every county in Florida is under a state of emergency as the state prepares for what may be the strongest hurricane to hit its east coast in nearly three decades. At 105 mph, Dorian is the strongest storm of the Atlantic hurricane season so far. If it makes landfall as a\u00a0Category 4\u00a0storm on Monday as forecast, with sustained winds of around 130 mph, it will be the strongest hurricane to strike Florida's East Coast since Andrew in 1992, according to CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller.  Dorian is currently a Category 2 storm. It will also be the fourth year in a row of a hurricane of any strength hitting Florida, the most years in a row since the 1940s. After tearing through\u00a0the British and US Virgin Islands and\u00a0drenching Puerto Rico\u00a0with rain Wednesday, Dorian was moving northwest in the Atlantic Thursday night. Hurricane Dorian is strengthening once again, with winds increasing up to 105 miles per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center.\u00a0This makes Dorian a Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale.\u00a0 \"Dorian is expected to become a major hurricane on Friday and remain an extremely dangerous hurricane through the weekend,\" said the Center in its latest public advisory. Hurricane Dorian is expected to make landfall in Florida as a category 4 storm on Monday.\u00a0 The advisory adds that there may be life-threatening flash floods, swells and rip current conditions. There are currently no coastal watches or warnings currently in effect. Read the full public advisory here. Hardware retailer Home Depot is working to get supplies in place before\u00a0Dorian\u00a0strikes.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAs communities prepare for Hurricane\u00a0Dorian, we\u2019ve sent more than 160 truckloads of supplies to our stores,\u201d The Home Depot announced yesterday on Twitter.\u00a0\u00a0 Residents in Florida, Georgia, and other southern states have been stockpiling supplies in the past two days as they prepare for the hurricane, which is expected to make landfall over Labor Day weekend. Teams at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida are working to protect the Artemis space flight hardware from\u00a0Dorian.\u00a0 Artemis is the NASA project to put humans back on the moon's South Pole by 2024. On Wednesday, NASA moved equipment like the Mobile Launcher indoors to protect the hardware from strong winds.  \"We will continue to monitor the weather throughout the preparations and roll operations and should there be a significant change, our team will be poised to adjust.\u00a0In its\u00a0final phases of development, the mobile launcher stands nearly 400 feet tall and is needed to assemble, process and launch NASA\u2019s powerful Space Launch Rocket and Orion spacecraft on missions to the Moon and Mars,\" said Alison Knox, a NASA\u00a0spokesperson. According to Knox, the\u00a0space center is scheduled to close at 6 pm ET on Saturday, but that could change if the storm slows.\u00a0 Ahead of Hurricane\u00a0Dorian, Florida has launched a website monitoring the generator status of nursing homes and long-term care facilities. All Florida nursing homes and assisted living facilities are required to keep residents in a safe environment in an emergency -- and part of this includes regulating temperature. The facilities must have an emergency power plan to make sure air conditioners keep temperatures under 81 degrees. \"I think that sends a very important message that if you are entrusted of care with these vulnerable population, it\u2019s really your responsibility to have a plan in case for what is going to happen,\" said the state's governor DeSantis earlier on Thursday. \"You should have a plan in place to be able\u00a0to protect the people that you are charged with looking after.\" Stay updated with the map here. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis sent a letter to the White House on Thursday, requesting a pre-landfall disaster declaration from President Trump ahead of Hurricane\u00a0Dorian.\u00a0 \u201cWith Hurricane\u00a0Dorian\u00a0strengthening, I have sent a letter to President Donald Trump requesting that he declare a pre-landfall disaster for all of Florida\u2019s 67 counties. The trajectory of this storm remains uncertain, and this declaration will provide us with the necessary resources to ensure the state is fully prepared,\" said the Gov. DeSantis. \u00a0\"I am confident the President will grant my request and show his full support for Florida,\" he added. According to the governor's press release, the declaration will provide important resources and assistance from the federal government, as well as free up funding sources for emergency protective measures. NASA has captured data from Hurricane Dorian, which is expected to hit Florida's coast this weekend. The space agency's Aqua satellite has an atmospheric infrared sounder, which is used to map the temperature, humidity, cloud amounts and heights in the Earth's atmosphere.  In the image below, taken on Thursday afternoon, the purple area signals cold clouds carried high into the atmosphere by thunderstorms -- also signaling heavy rainfall. Blue and green indicate warmer areas with shallower rain clouds, while the orange and red represent mostly cloud-free air. The US Navy has ordered evacuation for aircraft at the Naval Air Station Jacksonville and ships at the Naval Station Mayport. Both the air station and port are located on Florida's East Coast, where the hurricane is expected to hit first. The aircraft and ships will begin evacuating on Friday to Navy bases in the southeast and mid-Atlantic.  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said in a press release that the state is preparing for Hurricane Dorian with all available resources, with 2,500 Florida National Guard members activated and another 1,500 on standby. The governor is also working with federal, state, and local emergency officials to prepare for the storm, which is forecasted to hit the state's east coast as a major hurricane -- possibly even a Category 4, the statement said. Here's how the state is preparing: Food and water: Florida has 819,000 gallons of water and 1.8 million meals ready for distribution. Another 200,000 gallons of water are on the way, bringing the total to more than 1 million gallons. The state has pre-deployed 860,000 bottles of water to preparing counties.\nSchools: Schools will close on Tuesday in Martin and Volusia counties. Daytona State College, Valencia College, University of Central Florida, Florida Atlantic University, and Florida Polytechnic University will also close for varying periods.\nEmergency response: 15 urban search and rescue teams are on standby. State agencies like the Florida Highway Patrol, Department of Highway Safety, and Florida Department of Law Enforcement have prepared emergency response resources.\nMedical response: County health departments are pre-identifying and preparing resources, and the Department of Elder Affairs is working to meet needs of elderly and disabled Floridians.  Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia said Thursday that President Donald Trump's change in tone on Hurricane Dorian after it was announced that\u00a0the storm will make landfall in Florida, skirting Puerto Rico, is because the state \"is not an island full of people of color.\" \"Well, part of it is that Florida could be a swing state in 2020. And part of it is Florida is not an island full of people of color. We have seen him again and again pick on anywhere color is involved,\" Beyer, a Democratic House member told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday. Disney Cruise Lines plans to operate its popular 4,000-passenger Disney Dream out of Port Canaveral to the Bahamas despite Dorian. The company has added two extra nights and turned the trip into a five-night sailing journey returning on Wednesday.  The cruise was initially set to arrive back in Florida on the same day Dorian is expected to make landfall. \"We will continue to monitor weather forecasts throughout your sailing and adjust as needed,\" the cruise line said in a statement.  The cruise line is giving options to passengers do not want to sail on the updated itineraries.\u00a0It's unclear whether the company has canceled any other routes.\u00a0 The International Space Station's camera is keeping an eye on Dorian from above. The camera captured the powerful storm around 1 p.m. Thursday as it roared over the Atlantic Ocean, north of Puerto Rico. Classes at the University of Central Florida and schools in Martin County will be canceled at least until Tuesday, officials said.  Bethune-Cookman University, a private, historically black university in Daytona Beach, Florida will also be closed beginning Friday until further notice, university officials said. \"Students\u00a0MUST\u00a0evacuate the residence halls and campus by\u00a06:00 p.m. on Friday, August 30, 2019,\" read a notice issued by the school.\n\"\ufeffStaff and Faculty are expected to secure their offices and cover computers and other electronic devices with plastic garbage bags to minimize any water intrusion.\" University officials said students living on campus who are not able to evacuate the city will be taken to a shelter in the area.  The US Air Force is evacuating 16 KC-135s aircraft from MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa, Florida to McConnell AFB in Kansas, a US Air Force official told CNN. The US Navy is also expected to move out to sea US warships in port at the US Naval Station Mayport in Jacksonville, Florida  Employees at a Walmart store in St. Augustine, Florida have been busy restocking shelves as residents continue searching for supplies ahead of Hurricane Dorian.  But shoppers could not find any water bottles or gallons in the store as of Thursday afternoon.  The University of Miami has canceled classes at the Coral Gables, marine and medical campuses from noon Friday through Tuesday, the university said in a press release.\u00a0 Classes will resume on Wednesday. All university events scheduled for the Labor Day weekend have been canceled on the Coral Gables and marine campuses. In an abundance of caution, the University is putting up storm shutters and positioning sandbags near doorways on the Coral Gables, marine, and medical campuses.  Hurricane Dorian is still a Category 1 storm with sustained winds of 85 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center's 5 p.m. ET advisory. Dorian is expected to strengthen into a Category 4 hurricane by Sunday, with 130 mph winds, near the Bahamas.  Here's the latest path: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has declared a state of emergency for the state ahead of Hurricane Dorian. The State of Emergency is for these counties: Brantley\nBryan\nCamden\nCharlton\nChatham\nEffingham\nGlynn\nLiberty\nLong\nMcIntosh\nPierce \nWayne  The state of emergency is for a period of 11 days, beginning today and ending on September 9. Since Hurricane Dorian left minimal impacts on Puerto Rico, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is now shifting teams to one of the storm's next targets: Florida. FEMA associate administrator Jeffrey Byard told reporters on Thursday that the agency has gotten \"no request\" to help in Puerto Rico or the US Virgin Islands. \u00a0\u201cThose teams are not needed so they\u2019re in the process of coming back and some of them are flying directly into Tallahassee to get ready for that mission,\"he said. Puerto Rico, still recovering from Hurricane Maria in 2017, was expected the storm to exacerbate the existing damage to infrastructure, but the island was\u00a0largely spared. Byard added that federal officials are bracing for a \u201cbig storm\u201d that warrants a \u201cbig response\u201d with a multi-billion dollar price tag.\u00a0 \u201cThe most important thing now is to make sure the citizens understand the dangers that Hurricane Dorian will pose,\" he  said. This is going to be a major storm again impacting some portions of Florida, somewhere along their Eastern coast, then go inland and create a lot of havoc with infrastructure, power, roads.\u00a0A lot of rain.\u201d\u00a0 New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell commemorated the 14th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina today during a wreath-laying ceremony. LaToya and other public officials gathered at the Katrina Memorial on Canal Street to remember the victims of the storm, which made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana,\u00a0in 2005 as a Category 3 storm with winds near 127 mph. \"As Hurricane Dorian approaches Florida, we are mindful of what we experienced here during Katrina on the 14th anniversary. Let us all remember how far we have come, be grounded in love so we can move forward together,\" Cantrell said in a press release. Some other facts and figures on Hurricane Katrina: About 25,000 storm evacuees were sheltered at the Louisiana Superdome,\u00a0a sports arena. Wind and water damage to the roof created unsafe conditions, leading authorities to conduct emergency evacuations of the Superdome.\u00a0\nThe total damage is estimated to be $125 billion (not adjusted for inflation).\nIn an analysis of 971 fatalities in Louisiana and 15 additional deaths of storm evacuees,\u00a040% of deaths were caused by drowning. 25% were caused by injury and trauma and 11% were caused by heart conditions.\nNearly half the fatalities in Louisiana were people over the age of 74.\nThe total number of fatalities \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 stands at 1,833. As the Hurricane Dorian approaches, President Trump will no longer travel to Poland on Saturday, a person familiar confirms to CNN. Hurricane Dorian is spinning in the Atlantic, heading toward Florida. At 85 mph, Dorian is the strongest storm of the Atlantic hurricane season so far. If Dorian continues on its current forecast.... It would be the strongest hurricane since 1992: A category 4 landfall would be the strongest hurricane to strike Florida\u2019s East Coast since Andrew in 1992\nIt would be the third year in a row with a major hurricane landfall for Florida: Major hurricanes are those Category 3 and above \u2014 Hurricane Irma hit in 2017 and Hurricane Michael made landfall last year.\nIt would be the fourth\u00a0year in a row of any hurricane hitting the state: For Florida, this would be the the most years in a row since the 1940\u2019s. Palm Beach County schools will be open as normal tomorrow, officials announced at an afternoon news conference. Officials are still monitoring the path of Hurricane Dorian, and they will access over the weekend after the storm hits.\u00a0 Gov. Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency for all 67 Florida counties \u2014\u00a0up from 26 counties yesterday.  During a press conference Thursday afternoon, DeSantis also discussed Florida's nursing home facilities and how 94.6% of them are in compliance with the state requirement. \"All residents, especially those along the east coast, need to be prepared for possible impacts. As it increases strength, this storm has the potential to severely damage homes, businesses and buildings, which is why all Floridians should remain vigilant. Do not wait until it is too late to make a plan.\" Other highlight's from the governor's press conference: Florida not currently under watches or warnings.\nNo evacuations ordered at this time.\nThe state has 819,000 gallons of water and 1.8 million meals ready for distribution. The National Hurricane Center dispatched its Gulfstream IV-SP\u00a0\"hurricane hunter\" aircraft into the Atlantic this afternoon to collect data on Hurricane Dorian as it works its way toward Florida's coast. The team aboard the Gulfstream is made up of Capt. Kristie Twining, Cmdr. Rebecca Waddington, and Lt. Lindsey Norman who made National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) history Aug. 5, 2018, as the first all-female crew to pilot an aircraft during a hurricane mission. The mission was for Hurricane Hector near Hawaii. The three women dropped atmospheric monitoring devices called dropsondes to collect temperature, pressure, wind speed, wind direction and humidity data--all crucial to creating NOAA\u2019s hurricane forecasts, NOAA reported. All three women were interviewed by NOAA for a story on their careers in February. In it, Waddington discussed what it's like being a woman in aviation and uniformed service: \"Unfortunately, women remain a minority in aviation, uniformed services, and most STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Math] fields for that matter. I often get asked if I am the photographer or scientist in the plane and people are surprised when I tell them I am the pilot. I think women naturally have a different leadership and thinking style than their male peers and that brings different perspectives to everyday tasks.\" Check out the route Waddington and the crew took on their Dorian mission Thursday here.  As Florida waits for another hurricane, a Publix in St. Johns decided to sweeten the situation by decorating a cookie cake with the path of the storm. Customer Jessica Sullivan posted a picture of the hurricane themed Dorian cookie cake on her\u00a0Facebook page\u00a0with the caption: \"Publix has all your hurricane party supplies.\" Sullivan spotted the cookie when she stopped in to buy a birthday cake for her son and saw the cookie. Big storms usually scare her boys, so she thought getting the cookie cake would help.  But a bit of bad news: There was only one left. The Publix store had no comment on the cake decoration. West Palm Beach Mayor Keith James told residents to make sure they have enough water and prepare for evacuations ahead of Hurricane Dorian. James said they are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best as the city watches the forecast of the hurricane. He advised residents have one gallon of water per person for five days. He also told residents to pay attention to city alerts and future evacuations. Hurricane Dorian, currently a Category 1 storm, is expected to intensify as it churns toward the Atlantic coast of the US. The National Hurricane Center will provide its next update at 5 p.m. ET. Until then, here's what you need to know about Dorian:  Where is the storm now? Hurricane Dorian is in the Atlantic Ocean, more than 300 miles off the coast of the South Eastern Bahamas. \nWhen is it going to hit? The storm is forecast to make landfall in Florida on Monday. \nHow powerful is it? Dorian is currently a Category 1 storm with maximum sustained winds of up to 85 mph. But it's going to intensify: Dorian is expected to become a Category 4 hurricane before it hits. Storms in that category have winds maximum sustained between 130 and 156 mph.\nWhat damage has it done so far? Dorian swept across the British and US Virgin Islands and whipped Puerto Rico with rain Wednesday,\u00a0  Hurricane Dorian is forecast to hit Florida on Monday as a Category 4 hurricane.  Here's the day-by-day look at what we're expecting: Thursday: Dorian will move into the Caribbean Sea northwest of Turks and Caicos. Less wind shear, less dry air and warm sea surface temperatures will make it stronger.\nFriday: The storm will likely becomes a major storm of Category 3 or higher. High pressure along the US East Coast will steer Dorian west, and tropical storm-force winds of 39 mph or greater will arrive in the Bahamas.\nSaturday: Tropical storm-force winds will arrive in Florida by the evening, and small fluctuations in storm intensity are likely.\nSunday: Dorian is expected to strengthen into a Category 4 hurricane, with 130 mph winds, near the Bahamas. The storm's forward movement will probably slow down.\nMonday: Dorian will creep toward Florida's east coast. The storm is expected to make landfall, possibly between the Space Coast and West Palm Beach. Hurricane conditions will be felt all day across an area that extends 40 miles from the storm's center. Carnival has modified some of its cruise ship itineraries in the Caribbean and Bahamas in preparation for Hurricane Dorian. \u00a0 The company will update its guests and travel partners with information on their cruises and posting updates on its website and on social media.

Naval Air Station PAO Kaylee LaRocque told CNN that they are starting to fly out the P-8A Poseidon and P-3C Orion aircraft today: Eight planes are going to Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michigan\n10 planes are going to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio\n12 planes are going to Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base in Ohio\n12 planes are going to Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base in Texas Hurricane Dorian is forecast to hit Florida as a Category 4 hurricane over Labor Day weekend. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has urged residents to prepare for the storm now. So what should you do first?\u00a0Here's a checklist to help you get started, with tips from the\u00a0American Red Cross,\u00a0Federal Emergency Management Agency, the\u00a0Department of Homeland Security and the\u00a0National Hurricane Center Kennedy Space Center's visitor center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, will likely be closed on Sunday and Monday because of Hurricane Dorian, the space center said in a statement. The space center said the complex will be open during normal business hours on Saturday \u2014 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. However, there will be no bus tours or special interest tours.\u00a0 \"Preparations at the visitor complex are well underway in anticipation of severe weather due to Hurricane Dorian,\" the space center said. Major airlines are issuing travel waivers for passengers traveling through Florida ahead of Hurricane Dorian. Here's how some airlines are handling the hurricane:\u00a0 Delta has issued travel advisories for the these impacted cities.\nAmerican Airlines is letting some passengers change their flights without fees. Read more about which flights qualify here.\nSpirit Airlines is offering travel waivers for flights to, from and through at least 10 cities. \nSouthwest Airlines said 18 flights cancelled Wednesday and Thursday out of 800 flights per airline spokesman. Travel waivers have been issued for passengers traveling to and from multiple cities.  Florida State University's Saturday football game against Boise State will be played in Tallahassee due to the uncertainty of the Dorian, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said  The game was supposed to be played in Jacksonville, on Florida's Atlantic coast. \u201cAfter consulting with emergency responders, law enforcement and hurricane preparedness teams at the state and local level, moving the game is the best option given the information we have at this time,\u201d FSU Director of Athletics David Coburn said in statement Thursday. \u201cWe regret having to move the venue in particular because of the tremendous work that the City of Jacksonville has invested in this event. They have been great partners, and we are disappointed that the game had to be moved.\u00a0Our fans were very much looking forward to the experience.\u201d All tickets previously purchased for the game in Jacksonville will be refunded, the school said.\u00a0Florida State will sell $10.00 general admission tickets online.\u00a0\u00a0 A NASA Earth satellite is estimating rainfall rates for Hurricane Dorian as it moves through the Atlantic Ocean. The space agency tweeted that the storm is \"packing heavy rains as it moves toward the Bahamas.\" \"Our @NASAEarth satellite has the ability to peer under the \u201chood\u201d or clouds of a storm and estimate the rainfall rates occurring,\" NASA said. Take a look: There's a reason why these maps are called spaghetti models. Just take a look. There are lines all over the place. Also known as spaghetti plots, these models show where\u00a0a tropical system, such as a hurricane, may go. Here's how to read them: The forecast track from each model is represented by a line. When these are all plotted together, they can look like a bunch of spaghetti. Sometimes they spread out and go all over the place. That is a good indication that there is low confidence in where the storm is likely to go. However, when they are all packed in close together, the forecaster can be more confident in where the storm is going. Read more about spaghetti models here. Inmates in Pasco County, Florida, are continuing to work on sandbagging efforts in preparation for Hurricane Dorian. The storm is expected to make landfall over Labor Day weekend as a Category 4 storm.  A photo of the inmates working was tweeted this morning by the Pasco Sheriff's Office along a schedule for sandbagging operations.  These inmates are not paid but are part of the department's crew of non-violent offenders who receive time off of their sentence for working, Kevin Doll, community relations director with Pasco Sheriff's Office, told CNN. \"We typically have inmates assist with sandbag operations for citizens in every emergency storm situation,\" Doll said. \"I have been here 21 years, and they have\u00a0been doing\u00a0it at least that amount of time. Inmate work crews can be from anywhere from five to 10 inmates, depending on the job at hand, including sandbagging.\" Here's a list of locations for sandbag pickup: Dorian is currently Category 1 storm with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph. The hurricane is forecast to increase significantly in not only strength but also in size as it approaches the Southeastern US, becoming a Category 4 storm before it makes landfall in Florida. Categories of hurricanes are defined by their wind speeds: Category 1: 74-95 mph\nCategory 2: 96-110 mph\nCategory 3: 111-129 mph\nCategory 4: 130-156 mph\nCategory 5: 157 mph or higher Here's a look at other major storms' wind speeds: Katrina made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana\u00a0in 2005 as a Category 3 storm with winds near 127 mph.\nSandy approached the US in 2012 as a Category 2 storm, meaning it had winds of at least 96 mph.\nIrma, in 2017, was the\u00a0first storm on record to maintain winds as strong as 185 mph for 37 hours. Remember: While wind speeds dictate a storm's category, other factors can determine storms' strength. Bigger storms make for wider-spreading impacts and also make storm surge worse as they build up a bigger swell. Here's a look at forecast winds for Hurricane Dorian: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state currently have one million gallons of drinking water. The state also has more than one million meals available for those who need it ahead of Hurricane Dorian, DeSantis said during a news conference this morning. The Pasco County Board of County Commissioners has issued a local state of emergency  ahead of Hurricane Dorian, according to a tweet from the county's sheriff.\u00a0 What this does: The declaration allows officials to waive everyday procedures and do what they feel is necessary to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the community. This includes:  Ordering evacuations\nPerforming public work\nMaking emergency purchases\nRenting equipment\nHiring workers\nUsing volunteers. The local state of emergency will be in effect for 7 days or until rescinded by the County Administrator if it\u2019s no longer needed.  Here's the tweet: Hurricane Dorian is forecast to be a Category 4 hurricane when it makes landfall in Florida over Labor Day weekend, according to the National Hurricane Center's latest advisory. The storm, which is currently a Category 1 with 85 mph maximum sustained winds, is about 370 miles off the coast of the Southeastern Bahamas. Here's a look at the latest predicted path: While Hurricane Dorian has not been caused by the climate crisis, we do know that climate change is making hurricanes more dangerous.  Here\u2019s how:  Storm surges are becoming more destructive: Rising sea levels, a product of expanding oceans, the loss of ice sheets and melting glaciers, makes a storm surge more menacing. Water levels along the Florida coast are nearly a foot higher than they were a century ago, automatically making the storm surge much higher. \nStorms are also becoming wetter: As water and air warms, evaporation increases and the air is capable of holding more water. With a temperature increase of just 1 degree Celsius, the amount of water vapor increases by 7%. And as the climate crisis has already seen the world become 1 degree hotter than it was 100 years ago, that means that there\u2019s more than 7% more water available in the atmosphere. When storms come along, they ring out that atmospheric moisture as rain, resulting in an increase of the rate of rainfall in hurricanes \u2013 and all other storms. We saw this during Hurricane Florence and Harvey, two of the wettest hurricanes ever recorded.\nStorms are becoming more intense: Oceans are not only getting hotter at the surface but at lower depths due to climate change caused by humans. When there\u2019s a lot of heat content in the ocean, it allows storms to intensify rapidly through a process called rapid intensification, which is defined by when maximum wind speeds increase by more than 35 mph in a 24-hour period. In the case of Dorian, at 11 p.m. ET Wednesday, the storm had sustained winds of 85 mph \u2014 The night before they were recorded at 50 mph.  Hurricane Dorian expected to make landfall on the Atlantic coast of Florida, where there\u00a0are 11 Trump Organization-owned properties. There\u00a0are no evacuation orders in place yet, and CNN has reached out to the Trump Organization for updates on whether they plan to close\u00a0any of the properties. Here's where the Trump properties are located: Compare that to Dorian's possible path: How Trump properties have handled hurricanes in the past: As Florida braced for Hurricane Irma in 2017, Trump\u2019s\u00a0Mar-a-Lago\u00a0property closed for hurricane preparations following\u00a0a\u00a0mandatory evacuation order. As CNN reported\u00a0at the time, Secret Service is not obligated to maintain\u00a0a\u00a0presence\u00a0at the club during\u00a0a\u00a0hurricane because it is not\u00a0a\u00a0permanent protected property,\u00a0according to former Secret Service\u00a0agent Jonathan Wackrow,\u00a0a\u00a0CNN contributor. When Trump isn't there, the local West Palm Beach Secret Service field office stays in close communication with Secret Service, but that doesn't mean it's fully staffed. Procedurally, Secret Service treats\u00a0a\u00a0trip to\u00a0Mar-a-Lago\u00a0as \"bespoke,\" just like\u00a0any short-term presidential trip to\u00a0a\u00a0Seattle Sheraton or\u00a0a\u00a0Phoenix\u00a0Marriott, sweeping\u00a0and securing the facility\u00a0and taking electronic countermeasures beforehand, Wackrow said.\u00a0 President Trump said Florida is \u201cgoing to be totally ready and Puerto Rico was totally ready\" for Hurricane Dorian, which is expected to hit the US over Labor Day weekend. Trump made the comment this morning during a call in to Fox News' Brian Kilmeade Show. He thanked FEMA and \"all of the first responders.\"  On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced plans to shift $155 million from FEMA's disaster relief fund to immigration priorities \u2014 which, along with FEMA, is a responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security. A FEMA spokeswoman said the agency has sufficient funding and acknowledged the challenges of responding to Dorian \"on top of a complex recovery effort\" from the earlier storms. Hurricane Dorian is putting a wrench in Grove Roots Brewing production schedule. The Winter Haven, Florida, beer company shut down brewing operations for at least a week because of the storm. \"We are worried about losing power, which causes a whole string of issues with an actively fermenting beer,\" owner Joe Dunham said.\u00a0\"Power outages will take down our cooling systems that keep the fermenters cold and our large coolers holding finished product.\" But instead of letting their sterilized fermenters sit idle, they're going to be put to use to help the community. Dunham said they're filling them with 1,500 of drinking water for residents in case there's water quality issues post-storm. \"We are first and foremost a community-centric brewery,\" Dunham says.\u00a0\"We believe in our small town and will do all we can to help people.\u00a0If the need arises, we will have plenty of water to share.\u00a0It\u2019s the least we can do for the community we love.\" Here's a look at the fermenters turned water tanks: Walt Disney World Resort's Hollywood Studios opened its new Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge park expansion Thursday while Florida braces for Hurricane Dorian. The park opened roughly four months after Disneyland in Anaheim, California, opened its own version inspired by the film series.  Disney has yet to announce any disruption in its opening weekend plans as of Thursday morning. The storm is expected to hit Florida's Atlantic Coast by Labor Day. Here are some more details about Disney's newest attraction: The setting for this new, interactive chapter in the \"Star Wars\" cannon is called Black Spire Outpost, on the planet Batuu, situated on the Outer Rim of the galaxy. It's not a location seen in any of the films or TV shows (yet), but it feels very familiar.\nThere are many fun connections to earlier \"Star Wars\" films and shows throughout Galaxy's Edge, the biggest being a full-scale, 100-foot-long Millennium Falcon.\u00a0\nOf all the things you can buy, two are build-you-own: droids and lightsabers. These options are so popular that you can and probably should make reservations through the My Disney Experience app or online. Arthur Sanders went to a Wawa in Port St. Lucie, Florida, this morning to top off his gas tank before work, and he got caught up with other Floridians filling up ahead of Hurricane Dorian.\u00a0\u00a0 \"They were directing traffic and had part of the parking lot blocked off,\" he says.\u00a0\u00a0 This is the second hurricane he's preparing for: He also lived through Hurricane Irma in 2017.\u00a0 He still needs to get a few supplies but is mostly ready.\u00a0He said\u00a0he'll put up hurricane shutters on Saturday, and he plans to ride out the storm with nearby family. Here's a look at the gas line this morning: Brooke Koontz was at the Walmart in Port Orange, Florida Wednesday night buying things to prepare for Hurricane Dorian.\u00a0 When she got there she saw some shelves were already empty. Thankfully, soon after she got there, employees brought out a pallet of water. \"It was gone in seconds,\" she told CNN.\u00a0\"People were trying to race.\"\u00a0\u00a0 This is the third hurricane Koontz has prepared for. She lived through Hurricanes Matthew and Irma.\u00a0\u00a0 She says she's stocked up with about five to seven days of food but still needs to buy some small pools for her dogs in case they are without air conditioning for awhile. If you're looking for the 8 a.m. ET Hurricane Dorian update, it's not coming. The next update from the National Hurricane Center will come at 11 a.m. ET. Here's why: The National Hurricane Center releases new advisories every three hours \u2014 at 2, 5, 8 and 11, both a.m. and p.m. \u2014 when tropical storm or hurricane watches and warnings in place. But Dorian is over water right now, and no area is under a watch or warning. Under these conditions, the center only releases advisories every six hours: at 5 a.m., 11 a.m., 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. The 5 a.m. ET advisory is the latest, which reported that Dorian has maximum sustained winds of 85 mph. Here's a look at the latest predicted path: President Trump this morning tweeted about Hurricane Dorian, which is forecast to hit Florida's Atlantic Coast over Labor Day weekend. \"Be prepared and please follow State and Federal instructions,\" he said. Last night, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he spoke with Trump to give him an update on Dorian: Carnival Cruise Line is making some itinerary changes to avoid\u00a0Hurricane Dorian. \"Our Fleet Operations Center continues to monitor the storm and will make any adjustments as needed as the safety of our guests and crew is our number one priority,\" the cruise line said in a statement. Here's a look at how the company is changing its routes: Carnival Sunrise will stop at San Juan tomorrow, instead of Grand Turk. On Saturday it will stop at  Amber Cove instead of San Juan. On Sunday, it will dock in Grand Turk, instead of Amber Cove. \nCarnival Magic will stay at sea today instead of stopping at Amber Cove. It will stop in Nassau tomorrow instead of staying at sea.\nCarnival Sensation will stay at sea on Sunday instead of stopping in Nassau. On Monday, it will head to Grand Turn instead of Half Moon Cay. It will head to Half Moon Cay on Tuesday and Nassau on Wednesday.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parts of Florida could feel tropical-storm-force winds as early as Saturday evening, according to the National Hurricane Center. The center urged residents to make preparations now ahead of Hurricane Dorian. Dorian, currently a Category 1 storm, is\u00a0forecast to grow into a major Category 3 over Labor Day weekend before landing in Florida.

mosquitoes. A sample of mosquitoes from Washington Township, New Jersey, tested positive for West Nile Virus and Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), according to local officials. It's the first sample to ever test positive for EEE in Warren County. Basically, these mosquitoes could potentially kill you.  EEE is a virus that causes brain inflammation and, though rare, can be fatal.  Just earlier this month, a Massachusetts woman died after being infected with EEE. West Nile Virus also causes brain inflammation and is typically more prevalent than EEE, though EEE has a higher mortality rate.  Public officials in New Jersey were already bracing for an increased amount of West Nile Virus this year, with the first case of the infection being reported on July 2 -- the earliest ever reported in the state. Last year, a record 61 people in New Jersey were reportedly infected with West Nile.  But EEE has also been making its presence known. The Washington Township Police Department said in a Facebook post that this has been a very active year for EEE in New Jersey, with one recorded human case this year.  For comparison, the state only had one reported case in 9 years prior, between 2009 and 2018.  Approximately a third of people infected with EEE die, and there's currently no specific treatment for the virus, according to the CDC. There's no specific treatment for West Nile Virus, either. Meanwhile, local police are encouraging residents to wear repellent. The Warren County Mosquito Control Commission is also planning on spraying adult mosquitoes in the area where they collected the sample. But, as they say, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and the best way to prevent infections from EEE and West Nile is to not get bitten in the first place, says the CDC.  In other words, stay inside, people.

At 105 mph, Dorian is the strongest storm of the Atlantic hurricane season so far. If it makes landfall as a Category 4 storm on Monday as forecast, with sustained winds of around 130 mph, it will be the strongest hurricane to strike Florida's East Coast since Andrew in 1992, according to CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller. By late Thursday, Dorian was a Category 2  storm. It will also be the fourth year in a row of a hurricane of any strength hitting Florida, the most years in a row since the 1940s. With the devastation of 2018's Hurricane Michael still fresh in their minds, Floridians are not taking any chances. Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday declared a state of emergency for all 67 Florida counties. The state has 819,000 gallons of water and 1.8 million meals ready for distribution, he said in a news conference. After tearing through the British and US Virgin Islands and drenching Puerto Rico with rain Wednesday, Dorian was moving northwest in the Atlantic Thursday night.  TRACK THE STORM Warm waters are expected to strengthen the storm over the next few days. It's on track to smack Grand Bahama island on Sunday and likely crash somewhere along the Florida or Georgia coasts around Monday morning. Because it's four days out, the range of potential landfall spots stretches - from the Florida Keys to southeast Georgia. And the center may pause at sea shortly before landfall, leaving its outer bands to drench much of Florida with lots of rain, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. The affected areas in the US will feel tropical-storm force winds of at least 39 mph as early as Saturday evening. \"People have got to be ready before Sunday,\" Ken Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center, told CNN's \"New Day\" on Thursday. Floridians are lining up for gas and food Officials, including Florida's governor, have urged people to have seven days of food and medicine available -- and coastal residents already are stripping store shelves bare with Dorian in mind. Plenty of people also were stocking up on fuel Thursday along Florida's Atlantic coast. That included Arthur Sanders, who waited in a long line to get gas in Port St. Lucie. \"They were directing traffic and had part of the parking lot blocked off,\" Sanders said. In Port Orange, 40 miles northeast of Orlando, Brooke Koontz found shelves of bread and water nearly empty at a Walmart on Wednesday. There were also slim pickings among canned goods, toiletries and bananas, too. Thankfully, soon after she arrived, employees brought out a pallet of water. \"It was gone in seconds,\" she told CNN. \"People were trying to race.\"   Long lines and low supplies have been seen at several stores in the Miami area, CNN affiliate WSVN reported. States of emergency have been declared in more than 25 Florida counties. Numerous officials are urging residents to get ready. \"Get water, get gas, get cash out of the ATMs,\" West Palm Beach Mayor Keith James said on CNN Thursday. \"The more we hear about this storm, it sounds like a serious one.\" Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp told residents of his state to keep their eyes on Dorian, too. On Thursday, Kemp issued a state of emergency for 12 counties  Airlines, the military and athletes are adjusting Major airlines are allowing some passengers to re-book certain flights ahead of Hurricane Dorian, including Delta, American and Southwest.  The US Navy said it is moving more than 40 planes from Jacksonville to bases in Michigan, Ohio and Texas on Thursday, ensuring Dorian won't reach them. The US Air Force is evacuating 16 KC-135 aircraft from MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa to McConnell Air Force Base near Wichita, Kansas, according to a US Air Force official. Florida State University had been scheduled to play its season-opening game off campus, in Jacksonville near the Atlantic coast. But because Dorian will be approaching, the game has been moved to FSU's normal home field in Tallahassee, further inland. Because Dorian could impact Florida's Kennedy Space Center, NASA has said it will have a crawler-transporter move NASA's mobile launcher Friday from launch pad 39B to the Vehicle Assembly Building about 3.5 miles away. The launcher was being tested on the pad in anticipation of future Space Launch System missions. Dorian has cleared the Caribbean Sea, but not before lashing the British and US Virgin Islands -- first as a tropical storm and then as a Category 1 hurricane -- on Wednesday.  Puerto Rico, still recovering from Hurricane Maria in 2017, expected the storm to exacerbate the existing damage to infrastructure, but the island was largely spared.

The St. Louis man has spent more than half his life in prison for a murder the city's chief prosecutor says he did not commit.  Johnson, 45, is serving a sentence of life without the possibility of parole in Missouri. But a report from St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner and the Conviction Integrity Unit outlined what her office called misconduct by police and prosecutors in the case, including perjury, false testimony and the payment of more than $4,000 to the sole eyewitness. The witness later recanted. Dwight Warren, the assistant circuit attorney who prosecuted the case, vehemently denied the \"outlandish\" accusations laid out in the report, particularly the charge of paying a key witness. He also defended the detectives on the case.   \"Anybody who knows me, knows that that is not my character,\" Warren, who was also a St. Louis police officer, told CNN. \"I could probably have every judge in this circuit ... in my day testify to that. I think it's a one-sided hatchet job.\" \"The witness may have been compensated out of fear for his life and we may have relocated him, but this was 25 years ago and I cannot tell you with certainty,\" he added. Gardner's office said it will appeal a state court judge's denial of a new trial.  Circuit Judge Elizabeth Hogan ruled last week that the court had no authority to grant a new trial because the motion was \"filed approximately twenty-four years\" after the mandated deadline of 15 days after the verdict. \"The evidence is overwhelming,\" Johnson's attorney, Lindsay Runnels, who -- along with the Midwest Innocence Project -- also plans to appeal the ruling, said via email. \"The State agrees. In the interests of justice and fairness, that should be enough to overcome a missed deadline.\"   Two other men later signed sworn affidavits admitting to the killing  Johnson was convicted in 1995 of the murder of Marcus Boyd, who was shot to death a year earlier on the front porch of his apartment by two masked men.   Police said at the time that Johnson and another man, Phillip Campbell, fatally shot Boyd following what witnesses suggested was a drug dispute. But Campbell and a man named James Howard later signed sworn affidavits admitting they killed Boyd and that Johnson was not involved, according to court documents.  Campbell, who died recently, was sentenced to seven years for his role in Boyd's death, according to Runnels. He served less than six years, she said. Howard is serving a life sentence for a homicide committed after Boyd's murder, she said. \"There is no statute of limitations on innocence and there is no expiration date on justice,\" Runnels said. \"A prosecutor's duty to correct errors of this magnitude is never terminated, and rightfully so. The integrity of the justice system depends on those in power telling the truth and correcting errors when they become known.\" The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, through a spokeswoman, declined comment.  Lone eyewitness to killing recanted his identification of Johnson   A July report by the Conviction Integrity Unit in Gardner's office cited numerous errors and examples of misconduct by police and prosecutors that deprived Johnson of a fair trial. Conviction integrity units have been created in various US cities to review post-conviction claims of innocence and exonerate wrongfully convicted defendants.  \"Johnson's case is ultimately about innocence,\" the report said. \"Johnson did not shoot Boyd and had nothing to do with Boyd's murder, and he should not be in prison for the crime. Imprisonment of an innocent person constitutes a 'manifest injustice.'\" The 70-page report said the lone eyewitness to the shooting received more than $4,000 in payments from prosecutors \"to identify Johnson as one of the shooters.\" The payments were listed as moving expenses, utilities, storage and other items. The witness, Greg Elking, later said the state also helped him resolve several outstanding traffic violations. The report said the information was not disclosed to Johnson's defense lawyers at the time of his trial.  In 2003, Elking recanted his identification of Johnson in a letter to a St. Louis pastor.  Elking wrote that he could not pick the gunmen out of lineups and that he agreed to testify after police and prosecutors offered to \"help me financially,\" according to Gardner's report. He wanted to clear his conscience, he wrote.   The report also said police \"likely fabricated\" the alleged motive for Johnson to kill Boyd. Four witnesses who suggested a possible motive later disputed some statements attributed to them in police reports.  \"The newly discovered evidence exonerates Johnson,\" the state's motion for a new trial said.  \"The State has reviewed the evidence and conducted its own investigation and is convinced that Johnson is innocent and that repeated and prejudicial government misconduct occurred. These exceptional circumstances and the interests of justice warrant the granting of a new trial for Johnson or a hearing despite the motion being out of time.\" The deadline for the appeal of the judge's ruling is Tuesday.

Jason T. Harris, 44, was arrested Tuesday and is being charged with three felonies, Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton announced at a news conference filmed by CNN affiliate WJRT. Leyton said the charges include premeditated first-degree murder and solicitation of murder, both of which can result in a life sentence, and delivery of a controlled substance causing death.  \"We believe Jason Harris murdered his wife,\" Leyton said. \"We believe he put heroin into her cereal and milk the night she died after getting it from someone. ...\" Jason Harris' attorney, Nicholas Robinson, told CNN that his client has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is in custody at the Genesee County Jail.  Robinson said Jason Harris has been cooperating with state police and has been mourning his wife since she died.  \"We were very surprised and frankly saddened to learn the original determination of accidental overdose has been overturned and that has led to these charges,\" Robinson said. He declined to respond further to the prosecutor's allegations.  Authorities originally ruled the death of Christina Ann-Thompson Harris was an accidental homicide, Leyton said, but the medical examiner amended the ruling to homicide after a deeper investigation. At the news conference, Leyton said police were dispatched to a home in Davison, Michigan, on September 29, 2014, where Christina Harris was found dead.  According to Leyton, a neighbor told police that Jason Harris said Christina had been \"fighting a cold\" and had been treated for asthma, according to Leyton. He said police learned he had fed Christina cereal and milk the night before her death.  Leyton said Jason Harris's brother and sister went to police a few days later and told them Jason had \"made comments in the past about, quote, getting rid of Christina Harris.\" He said they also felt Jason Harris was seeing other women prior to his wife's death.  During the investigation, according to Leyton, some former coworkers of Jason's told police that Jason Harris asked them what kinds of pills are tasteless and odorless, and that he offered one of them $5,000 to kill his wife. The co-workers said Jason Harris told them he did pay a man $5,000 to kill his wife, but the man was arrested for a parole violation before he could do it, Leyton said. Leyton said Jason Harris was fired from his job for a \"pattern of positive drug testing\" and collected a total of $120,000 in life insurance money for his wife's death. Christina Harris, Leyton said, had recently been promoted to manager of Genesee County's busiest Subway restaurant, where said she was a mentor and friend to her coworkers. She had given birth in May to her second child with her husband and was an \"incredibly loving mother,\" according to Leyton.  He said Christina never tested positive for any drugs at doctors' visits during her pregnancy. Leyton said investigators were able to obtain samples of breast milk that Christina had frozen prior to her death, and found no controlled substances. Jason's next court appearance is scheduled for September 5.  John Potbury, deputy chief assistant prosecutor, said the Harris children went into the care of Child Protective Services within the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

Minutes later, Raleigh police showed up, handcuffed Oyeneyin and took him outside in his underwear while they started clearing his house.  \"What have I done wrong?\" the black homeowner asks, as seen in his home security camera footage from August 17. \"I haven't done nothing wrong.\"  On Monday, Raleigh police explained the officers' actions, saying there were several clues that led police to believe a real burglary might have happened.  But Oyeneyin, a concert promoter and nightclub owner known as Tim Boss, said the case is just another example of a black man getting profiled as a criminal in a predominantly white neighborhood. \"It's a stereotype that I just don't want to deal with,\" Oyeneyin said. What the home security footage shows  In one clip, Oyeneyin's burglar alarm blares through his townhouse. Oyeneyin walks downstairs, punches in a code to stop the alarm, and goes back upstairs.  In an interview with CNN, Oyeneyin said the alarm went off because a friend had stayed at his house the night before. When the friend left the house, he accidentally set off the alarm.  Oyeneyin said he's had about four false alarms before. But in the past, police usually came to his house and asked for identification. The officer typically took note of the incident and left, Oyeneyin said. Not this time.  The security footage shows the first arriving officer opening Oyeneyin's unlocked front door. \"Police! (If) you're inside, let yourself be known,\" the officer shouts into the home. Oyeneyin responds from upstairs, though his words aren't clear in the video.  The officer tells him to come down with his hands up. He quickly sees Oyeneyin has a gun in his hand.  Oyeneyin told CNN he wasn't sure who was downstairs at his front door, so he took his legally owned handgun with him as a precaution. In the video, he announces that he has a firearm.  The officer tells Oyeneyin to drop the weapon, and Oyeneyin immediately does. \"Come on out here,\" the officer says, stepping farther outside the house.  \"I got on my drawers,\" Oyeneyin responded, refusing to leave his foyer. \"Turn around. Put your hands behind your back,\" the officer said.  \"For what?\" Oyeneyin replies, exasperated.  The homeowner and officer have a tense exchange, with the officer demanding Oyeneyin get down on his knees and turn around with his hands behind his back.  Oyeneyin does get down on his knees, but he refuses to turn his back toward the officer. He later told CNN he feared for his safety. \"It's turning around that I'm afraid of. I'm afraid you're going to shoot me,\" Oyeneyin told CNN.  \"I'm tired of having cops pointing guns at me. I've been through this rodeo before,\" he told CNN. You want me to turn around and face the other (side) where I cant see you? It was more of a safety thing for me, not a compliance.\" The officer eventually enters Oyeneyin's home and handcuffs him. As they wait for a police supervisor to arrive, the officer asks Oyeneyin if he lives at the home and if he has identification.  \"Yep,\" Oyeneyin replied both times.  But the officer doesn't ask Oyeneyin to show him his ID. Instead, the officer explains his actions, saying the door was unlocked, he made several announcements before Oyeneyin responded, and that Oyeneyin emerged from upstairs with a gun.  \"I'm just trying to figure out whether you're supposed to be here or not, OK?\" the officer said. \"I got on drawers, bro ... (what do) you mean, am I supposed to be here?\" Oyeneyin replied. \"I'm just trying to figure out who you are, and whether you're supposed to be here or not,\" the officer said. But he does not ask to see Oyeneyin's ID. Moments later, the officer's supervisor shows up. The sergeant tells Oyeneyin to \"have a seat, because we're going to clear the rest of the house.\"  More officers show up. As Oyeneyin keeps asking questions, one officer says, \"put him in the car.\" \"I haven't done nothing wrong,\" Oyeneyin says, as he's taken away handcuffed. Later in the video, one of the officers brings Oyeneyin back inside, telling other police that Oyeneyin is the homeowner and that no burglary took place. The officers leave.  What the police department says Raleigh police sent a statement to CNN on Monday explaining the first officer's actions.  After receiving a report of an active burglar alarm, the officer \"arrived within minutes and found the front door ajar.\"  \"After several attempts to contact anyone within the residence, an unidentified male who was armed with a handgun came into the officer's view,\" Raleigh police spokeswoman Donna-maria Harris said in the statement. \"While the resident stated he turned off his alarm prior to RPD's arrival, the alarm company never called dispatch to cancel police response.\" The police statement said even though the resident said he lived at the house, \"the officer had no way to safely confirm the validity of the statement or check the residence for additional persons until other officers arrived on scene.\" \"Based on all available facts known to the officer at the time, the resident was detained until additional officers arrived and his identity could be confirmed,\" police said.  The resident was detained for about seven minutes, police said. The department said it is reviewing the incident.  'This has been going on too long' Oyeneyin said the incident is just the latest indignity he's faced as a successful black homeowner. \"I've been kicked out of a home I used to live (in) because police have accused me of being a gang member,\" he said.  \"I've been sweeping this under a rug, thinking this is America.\" But now that he has a son, Oyeneyin said it's time to speak out.  \"I want to raise awareness to what's going on,\" he said. \"This has been going on too long, and I just need it to stop.\"", "sourceId": "article_14F51F97-587F-AFE7-12A2-CEBA1E02FBE4", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/27/us/raleigh-burglar-alarm-homeowner-detained/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-08-27T14:35:54Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-08-27T19:28:54Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-08-27T19:28:54Z", "path": "/2019/08/27/us/raleigh-burglar-alarm-homeowner-detained", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Holly Yan and Tina Burnside, CNN", "contributors": ["Holly Yan", "Tina Burnside"], "headline": "A black homeowner was handcuffed and detained in his boxers after his burglar alarm went off", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190826011909-homeowner-detained-story-body.jpg", "tags": [{"id": "fd529c2d-a4f7-4f7e-b39a-850e8a28c03f"}, {"id": "3512d6d8-b2e5-4f74-97f6-024ab343c13a"}, {"id": "ccb6862b-2edc-455f-a65c-742126dc5cb0"}, {"id": "eed52bc5-e96a-43f0-bcfa-662dd1c61660"}, {"id": "ee690ffe-bb13-48d6-9030-ae1413b86e78"}, {"id": "8d7177ef-0a7e-44b5-9a58-6c98c0968023"}, {"id": "c7e52082-094d-5d63-b82e-4b8d5a9048b9"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d"}, {"id": "3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "b852b5d8-31c6-49e9-8ff1-986a55356fa1"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "95e6524c-9692-4f20-99de-7e4a401a69e6"}, {"id": "c2e82037-93f5-502f-b75b-0cb7b8316689"}, {"id": "1804359b-a654-428b-8e8a-d081c8ade29a"}, {"id": "80f3b9c3-a02e-5894-9465-e9338d4d0532"}, {"id": "9c5826c0-329c-54ce-b065-3826ae02b3ab"}, {"id": "f0a0d4d0-7cb3-5328-89b8-73721db659bf"}, {"id": "371d0edb-606f-5060-9394-aa93235b9684"}, {"id": "ae6f1bf1-a876-507e-9116-bb834e53cdae"}, {"id": "12967d01-3194-4c24-b4a8-91f471860718"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "tickers": []}, {"_id": "h_59f53977d9fe6b43ba35fe685d771b78", "type": "article", "body": "The 2020 Democratic candidates for president are everywhere. We know their policies. We know their playlists. But do we know their dogs?  Donald Trump eschewed tradition when he entered the White House pet-less. The last pups to live in the Oval Office were the Obamas' Portuguese water dogs, Bo and Sunny, and there is a long tradition of canines-in-chief. In honor of National Dog Day (annually on August 26), meet the canines vying to become America's next First Pup.  Joe Biden, Major and Champ Joe and Jill Biden adopted a German shepherd named Major from the Delaware Humane Association in 2018. The former foster pup befriended the family's other German shepherd, Champ, who's known to accompany the former VP to his office in Washington from time to time.  Clearly, Major is already media-trained--look at that smile! Elizabeth Warren and Bailey After losing her beloved golden retriever Otis in 2012, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren feared she wouldn't be able to love another dog. That's until the summer of 2018, when her husband, Harvard law professor Bruce Mann, gifted her a new retriever named Bailey.  Is there anyone on Earth (except maybe cat purists and people with allergies) who could resist a slobbery kiss from this angelic ball of fur? Warren certainly couldn't.  In an Instagram post, the senator said Mann sends her daily Bailey pupdates whenever she's on the road. It seems even when it comes to her dog, she's got a plan for that.  Pete Buttigieg, Truman and Buddy Both of the South Bend mayor's dogs are rescues, and now they're social media stars, too. Truman and Buddy share a Twitter account, where they explore their Indiana digs and root for their presidential candidate dad.  Buttigieg and his husband Chasten adopted Labrador-beagle mix Truman in 2017 and Buddy, a portly one-eyed puggle, came home one year later.  Kirsten Gillibrand and Maple Gillibrand adopted Maple, a labradoodle as sweet as her name, in 2017. She's known to make appearances at the New York senator's campaign headquarters, where she's showered in love and even plays some basketball. Beto O'Rourke and Artemis (and a handful of other animals) The former Senate hopeful from Texas seems to add an animal to his collection every day, and he regularly spotlights them on his Instagram stories.  The family lost their 16-year-old black Labrador retriever, Rosie, in July. But O'Rourke proudly shared his Vanity Fair cover with his other black lab, Artemis. He's filmed himself rescuing dogs, too, but for now, he's keeping just this one. As of press time, his family also has a cat named Silver, two turtles named Gus and Dan, a snake named Monty, a gerbil (who has not yet been fed to the snake) and what appears to be a bearded dragon his wife calls Sandman. If he's elected, his White House would closely resemble the National Zoo.  Tim Ryan, Bear and Buckeye The Ohio congressman went to a shelter for one dog and came home with these two sweet-eyed Labrador mixes. Buckeye shares his name with Ohio's state tree, and Bear shares his with any teddy that's as fluffy as him.  Michael Bennet and Pepper The Colorado senator promised his three daughters if he won his first campaign, he'd get them a dog. He did, so they ended up with Pepper, a tiny black Pomeranian mix they adopted through a Prison Trained K-9 Companion Program. Dogs are rescued from shelters statewide and paired with prisoners who train them before they're adopted by people outside of prison. You just know this feisty fluffball would stir up trouble in the Oval Office. The pup's partner in crime is a cat named Captain Flint. Honorable Mention: Cory Booker and Cha Cha New Jersey senator Cory Booker might not have a dog, but he did rescue a freezing pooch named Cha Cha who was stuck outside in the New Jersey winter in 2013, which seems like it merits a spot on a list of noted puppy lovers. Kamala Harris doesn't have a dog of her own, but she welcomes them in her Senate office. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has admitted he does not own a dog, missing an opportunity to name a St. Bernard after himself.  Representatives for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Marianne Williamson confirmed to CNN they, too, are pet-less, and the remaining candidates either didn't respond to CNN's requests for comment or haven't publicly discussed the pressing issue of their dog ownership.

The water crept out of Buffalo Bayou and into West Houston's Energy Corridor, home to numerous energy companies and residential neighborhoods.  It inundated Kyle Haines' home, drowning his 71-year-old husband, Bob. It left Maria Sotolongo's home nearly uninhabitable and set her on a costly road to rebuilding that would test her marriage. Two years later, they're still trying to recapture the sense of security that was swept away with their possessions. On top of that, they're embroiled in litigation over the Corps' role in what happened to them. Hundreds of West Houston property owners are suing the federal government, claiming the Corps flooded their homes to save the rest of the city. They allege the government owes them for effectively taking their property to store water from the reservoirs, in violation of a Fifth Amendment right which says the government can't take private property for public use without just compensation. But the government doesn't see it that way. The Corps referred questions about the litigation to the Department of Justice, which declined to comment. But in legal briefs, government lawyers blame the storm for the flooding. They claim the Addicks and Barker dams and reservoirs did their job and that the damage could have been worse if not for them. They say the government's responsibility to protect the public in an emergency trumps the plaintiffs' rights to their property. \"The Court should conclude here, as a matter of law and based on the undisputed facts, that to prove causation Plaintiffs must show that if the flood risk reduction Project had not been built, their properties would have flooded significantly less or not at all during Hurricane Harvey.\" And as the legal fight continues, so does the daily struggle to rebuild. \"This is not a 'been there, done that' kind of situation. We're still struggling to recover,\" said Marie Lynn Miranda, who oversees Rice University's Hurricane Harvey Registry, which tracks the storm's impacts on Houstonians. \"There are still people in Houston who are really having a hard time.\" He lost his love of 13 years It's not known exactly when Bob Haines died in the white ranch-style brick house at 754 Langwood Drive.  It took about five days after the first releases of water from the reservoirs for rescuers to deem conditions safe enough to retrieve his body. His death certificate says he was \"found\" on September 3, \"submerged in flooded residence.\" His cause of death is listed as drowning. Three days later, when Kyle Haines visited the house for the first time after the storm, he knew he could never live there again. The waters had receded, leaving colonies of mold splayed across the wall, he said. The smell of rot penetrated his face mask, imbuing the house with an intractable sense of loss, he said. Nevertheless, after settling in with relatives across town, he made regular visits to the home for months after. He would load his dog Paddi in his car and pick up a bouquet of flowers and a can of Foster's, Bob's favorite beer, on the way over. Once inside the house, Haines would cue up one of his late husband's favorite artists on his phone, usually Roy Orbison or the Mamas and the Papas. He would place the flowers on a spot in the bedroom where he believes Bob's body was found, take a seat on the floor and carry on conversations as if Bob were there. \"It was comforting to feel like I was with him,\" Haines said. Kyle met Bob at a bar in Montrose in 2004, a few months after Bob had moved into the house they would eventually share. When they met, Bob was 57 and nearing retirement after a successful career as a stockbroker. Kyle was 21 years old, and lacking direction. Though he was put off by the age difference between them, Bob won him over with his persistence and the promise of a comfortable life. They started a new chapter together despite objections from their families, Haines said. They weathered ups and downs stemming from the age difference and struggles with their own inner demons, he said. \"There was definitely some codependency and toxic behavior,\" he said. \"But I loved him. He was my teddy bear. You don't stay with someone for 13 years if there's no love.\" When Harvey made landfall in Houston overnight on August 25, Haines says he was in treatment for alcoholism, about an hour away in Galveston. Within 12 hours, Harvey was downgraded to a tropical storm, but rainfall continued, turning Houston's roads into rivers. The last time they spoke on the phone, on August 26 or 27, Kyle Haines says his husband was crying. He was fearful for Kyle's safety on the coast and pleaded for him to come home. Thinking he had survived the worst of the storm, Bob did not seem worried about himself, Kyle says, especially since no evacuation orders had been issued. Water released, but no evacuation orders In the late afternoon of August 27, the Corps released a statement on social media saying they would \"likely\" have to release intermittent amounts of water from both reservoirs to reduce the risk of uncontrolled flooding in the Houston metropolitan area.   Based on what the Corps had said about the amount it intended to release, the City of Houston and Harris County did not believe evacuation orders were warranted, said Alan Bernstein, director of communications for the Houston Mayor's Office. As the city and county saw it, the intended releases would amount to street flooding, \"which we don't consider to be flooding that invades people's homes and businesses,\" he said. To issue such a warning would have defied conventional wisdom, which recommends sheltering in place when water is the threat rather than directing a mass exodus of people onto the roads, where they will be more vulnerable to danger, he said. At 1:36 a.m. Houston time on August 28, the Corps shared another statement on social media saying the releases would begin immediately. The water surged through Buffalo Bayou, which carries water through West Houston and downtown Houston into the Houston ship channel. Later in the day, as rainfall continued and water levels in the reservoirs reached record highs, the Corps announced that releases would continue.  The flooding triggered rescue operations followed by voluntary evacuations of part of West Houston, then an evacuation order, Bernstein said. The Corps later acknowledged that it ended up releasing more water than it initially said it would.  \"The decision to make the increased controlled releases was a difficult, but necessary one that we did not take lightly,\" Edmond Russo, Galveston District deputy engineer, said in a statement.  \"We made them quicker than we would have preferred, because the Addicks pool rose faster overnight than we had forecast and the pool threatened our structures.\"  To this day, Kyle Haines wonders if he could have saved his husband's life if he had returned home when Bob asked him to. Because Kyle was in court-ordered rehab, he was worried about the consequences of leaving, in addition to being fearful of getting caught in the storm, he said. Haines filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Corps and Harris County Flood Control District in 2017 for his husband's death, but a judge dismissed it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  In a letter to clients, Haines' lawyer, Tony Buzbee, said the judge determined that HCFCD cannot be sued because it does not own the gates on the dam. Regarding the Corps, the judge said that it was insufficient to sue the Corps, and Haines had to identify the person who made the decision to open the gates, according to the letter.  The ruling felt like a \"slap in the face,\" Haines said. \"Why does it matter who made the decision? My husband is still dead.\" Now he sees the property litigation as his last chance to get justice for his husband. How the dams and reservoirs work Houston has long been prone to flooding. In response to devastating floods in 1929 and 1935, Congress authorized construction of the Addicks and Barker dams and reservoirs in the 1940s as part of flood control efforts in the Buffalo Bayou watershed. The project is managed jointly by the Corps, which oversees America's infrastructure, and local authorities, including HCFCD, which declined to comment citing the pending litigation. As urban development encroached upon the structures, the Corps made changes to minimize the risk of flooding. In 1963, they added gates to five conduits on each reservoir to restrict the flow of water to Buffalo Bayou. They also added auxiliary spillways at the ends of each reservoir to accommodate overflow. While refusing to answer questions about the litigation, the Corps led CNN on a tour of the project and provided information about how it operates. The vastness of the project is overwhelming. The Addicks and Barker reservoirs consist of earthen dams 11.5 and 13.5 miles in length, respectively, covered in vegetation. To imagine them brimming with stormwater as far as the eye can see is nothing short of terrifying. The reservoir is empty most of the time, and its gates are open. When it rains, the Corps' water control manual dictates when to close the gates to collect water, and when to open them to manage the flow of water through Buffalo Bayou. Documents included in legal filings show the Corps regularly assessed the structures. In 1979, anticipating that the reservoirs would capture a substantial amount of water during rain events of a certain magnitude, the federal government purchased land upstream of the reservoirs but did not buy the land it needed downstream, citing costs. Lawyers for the plaintiffs say the decision to not acquire more land put homes at risk during Harvey and will continue to threaten properties adjacent to the reservoirs. \"These reservoirs cannot handle the amount of rain we're seeing in this region,\" said Armi Easterby, lead counsel for plaintiffs upstream of the reservoir. \"It's pretty evident that until the government buys more land or changes its operations we're going to keep seeing this type of flooding.\" Where the litigation stands Haines' ordeal caught the attention of local television journalist Maria Sotolongo, who says her home was also wrecked in the aftermath of the releases. She included Haines in a documentary she produced about the flooding in West Houston, which has been screened locally.

The downstream cases are being tried separately from lawsuits involving properties that were upstream or behind the reservoirs because they involve different circumstances and legal arguments.

Facts:\nTwelve students and one teacher were killed by students Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18. The pair made home videos prior to the attack making references to what they were going to do and apologizing to their parents for it.  Harris and Klebold killed themselves with gunshot wounds to the head in the school's library at approximately 12:08 p.m. on the day of the shootings. SWAT teams entered the school 47 minutes after the shootings started. Five hours passed before law enforcement declared the school under control.  The Columbine shootings rank as one of the worst mass shootings in US history as well as one of the deadliest episodes of school violence. Victims: \nCassie Bernall, 17\nSteven Curnow, 14\nCorey DePooter, 17\nKelly Fleming, 16\nMatthew Kechter, 16\nDaniel Mauser, 15\nDaniel Rohrbough, 15\nWilliam \"Dave\" Sanders, 47\nRachel Scott, 17\nIsaiah Shoels, 18\nJohn Tomlin, 16\nLauren Townsend, 18\nKyle Velasquez, 16 Timeline:\nJanuary 1998 - Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris are arrested after stealing items from a van. After pleading guilty, they are sent to a juvenile diversion program. March 1998 - Randy and Judy Brown, parents of student Brooks Brown, file a report with the sheriff's office stating that Harris had threatened to kill Brooks and had written on the internet that he would like to kill people. April 20, 1999 - At approximately 11:19 a.m., two students, Klebold, 17, and Harris, 18, carrying guns and bombs, open fire inside Columbine High School, killing 13 and wounding 23 others before killing themselves. November 12, 1999 - Mark Manes is sentenced to six years in prison for selling a gun used in the murders to minors Harris and Klebold.  April 2001 - Close to three dozen families of Columbine victims settle suits with the parents of the suspects and gun suppliers. The settlement totals close to $2.5 million. The Harris' and Klebold's homeowners insurance will pay a large part and the rest will come from insurance company payments on behalf of the gun suppliers. The family of victim Isaiah Shoels does not accept the settlement.   August 20, 2002 - The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office settles with the daughter of teacher Dave Sanders for $1.5 million. June 2003 - Judge Robert Blackburn orders the family of Shoels to accept a $366,000 settlement in the lawsuit against the gunmen's families.  August 12, 2003 - The families of victims Daniel Rohrbough, Kelly Fleming, Matt Kechter, Lauren Townsend, and Kyle Velasquez settle a wrongful death lawsuit against parents Susan and Thomas Klebold and Wayne and Katherine Harris, in which the victims' families claim that the suspects' parents should have known what their sons were up to before the shootings. The terms of the settlement have not been released. October 22, 2003 - Home video of the two suspects is released by authorities. In the video, made six weeks before the murders, the suspects are seen in a forested area shooting at bowling pins.

February 12, 2016 - In the first television interview since her son Dylan killed 13 people at Columbine High School, Susan Klebold speaks to Diane Sawyer. Klebold states that \"If I had recognized that Dylan was experiencing some real mental distress, he would not have been there,\" she says. \"He would've gotten help. I don't ever, for a moment, mean to imply that I'm not conscious of the fact that he was a killer, because I am.\"", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120229124301-columbine-high-school-shooting-crosses-story-body.jpg", "language": "en", "tags": [{"id": "fd529c2d-a4f7-4f7e-b39a-850e8a28c03f"}, {"id": "b21c6c7c-6fe4-4f10-85da-b81821c55578"}, {"id": "3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734"}, {"id": "79e68efe-c60a-4a30-a061-75907457608a"}, {"id": "3512d6d8-b2e5-4f74-97f6-024ab343c13a"}, {"id": "6024d41e-1100-4a64-92fe-3b8fddd52f2b"}, {"id": "2d3d05cd-0408-44ab-9945-62f2e7b36321"}, {"id": "8d7177ef-0a7e-44b5-9a58-6c98c0968023"}, {"id": "e4fcd038-b942-42d8-83ca-196f124ca67e"}, {"id": "79c31015-bca0-413f-8b75-783b39c01385"}, {"id": "86f1d6f8-6a48-4e2c-8c1c-d3a9cbc794c2"}, {"id": "1354f0b2-eae6-43eb-b84c-2c2338105be1"}, {"id": "a1596a8a-0d9d-4ba3-ae1d-5035000deee4"}, {"id": "5650d962-d7f0-5810-89b5-67dd679215a0"}, {"id": "5905a802-fc93-4093-9c8c-fe1297ac434e"}, {"id": "089abbbb-0bb0-4d3f-91b6-877d37ba1c7b"}, {"id": "031ec210-598a-5479-9622-7a2760c51998"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "b852b5d8-31c6-49e9-8ff1-986a55356fa1"}, {"id": "5aa9e10b-1672-47d0-b9ad-68fb99bf3608"}, {"id": "3c4b8156-ac6f-48c2-90c8-bc18e0e184b9"}, {"id": "85186acd-6f35-432b-9fd7-5586c122151d"}, {"id": "5513f688-c810-4746-9612-5d9aa4fab994"}, {"id": "ba65a338-c7ea-48df-a75f-f66b59576260"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "e6776cec-1a1f-4f33-821d-a828e5e1a8d0"}, {"id": "7f9e3331-436d-4b95-8a53-05c644fe2597"}, {"id": "3cb08373-a14a-50f4-9aa1-56230e1e05ce"}, {"id": "9c5826c0-329c-54ce-b065-3826ae02b3ab"}, {"id": "a86a1280-b4cf-444a-a9dd-4722889c8cab"}, {"id": "f0a0d4d0-7cb3-5328-89b8-73721db659bf"}, {"id": "371d0edb-606f-5060-9394-aa93235b9684"}, {"id": "0156f51c-0c01-5ad6-935b-852c861d6c2a"}, {"id": "9e77e33a-ec67-5055-bb7a-f945a97882b6"}, {"id": "aac2ed4f-8594-4761-a990-875dbd31aafb"}, {"id": "12967d01-3194-4c24-b4a8-91f471860718"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "lastPublishDate": "2019-08-24T00:33:41Z", "tickers": []}, {"_id": "h_74944b4939a3b433568148281dc0799e", "type": "article", "body": "A former Houston police officer who authorities said lied to obtain a search warrant for a raid in which two people died and five officers were injured has been charged with murder, a prosecutor said Friday. Gerald Goines, who had a 35-year law enforcement career, faces two felony murder charges, said Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg. A second former officer, Steven Bryant, is accused of tampering with evidence. \"The eyes of this community and the nation are on this case; it is critical to the public trust that we reveal the true facts about what, how and why two civilians were killed in their own home by members of the Houston Police Narcotics Squad 15,\" Ogg said in a statement. The two officers were part of the tactical team during the botched January 28 raid of a home that killed Rhogena Nicholas and Dennis Tuttle and injured officers who were part of that team. Goines was injured in the shooting.   Goines obtained a warrant for a \"no knock\" raid from a municipal judge under false pretenses, which included claiming a criminal informant purchased heroin from a man at the address the day before and that the man selling drugs was known to have a gun, among other things, which meant there was no need for police to knock on a door before entering, Ogg said. Ogg said that because two people died while Goines was allegedly committing a felony -- tampering with a government record by obtaining one under false pretenses -- he was charged with two counts of felony murder in the deaths. She indicated a grand jury could consider capital charges. Bryant was charged with evidence tampering because he provided a supplement to the original report after the raid which contained falsehoods, authorities said. The officer allegedly said he had previously assisted Goines in the investigation of the home and that during the investigation he found baggies with a brown substance he believed to be heroin that matched the heroin purchased by an informant prior to the raid, Ogg said. Authorities said they were reviewing more than 14,000 cases within the department. Nicole DeBorde, attorney for Goines, said she wished a grand jury had reviewed the case before charges were brought. Her client has cooperated and has a $150,000 bond, DeBorde said. Bryant's attorney, Andy Drumheller, said the former officer turned himself in and was posting bond.  Drumheller said Bryant had no role in drafting the police affidavit, never discharged his weapon and did not enter the residence where the raid occurred. Bryant has cooperated with the investigation and \"we will defend him in court.\" Police Chief Art Acevedo in February said the department will change its policy and now require officers wanting to conduct a raid without knocking on the suspect's door or ringing the doorbell to get approval first from the chief or the chief's designee.  Police have said Goines used a confidential informant to confirm that drugs were being sold in the home that police raided, according to affidavits obtained by CNN. The affidavits, dated February 14, detail the investigation after the raid. Following the raid, Goines named his informants to investigators, but the informants told authorities they had not worked with Goines on this particular case, according to affidavits. When narcotics officers breached the front door of the home, gunfire erupted almost immediately. One suspect retreated to the back of a room and re-emerged, returning fire, police said. The second was shot while trying to wrestle a shotgun away from an officer, they said. Both suspects were killed.  Officers found marijuana, five guns and a white powder believed to be cocaine or the painkiller fentanyl, Acevedo said after the raid.  The Houston Police Officers' Union said it would not comment on the case against the two officers because of criminal proceedings. But the union said it was pleased no other officers were implicated. Ogg said she has not seen a case like this in 30 years. Asked what she would say to the Tuttle and Nicholas families, the prosecutor said: \"I want to tell them how sorry we are as a city and a county for actions that resulted in the loss of their loved ones' lives.\" The family of Rhogena Nicholas said it wants to see sworn depositions of those involved in management of the police department's narcotics squad. \"We believe the court has sufficient basis to order the depositions requested to investigate possible wrongful death, civil rights and other legal claims,\" the family said.", "sourceId": "article_EF2B5990-3F21-B1D0-C1F8-C02748058638", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/23/us/houston-officers-charged-no-knock-raid/index.html", "firstPublishDate": "2019-08-23T21:38:08Z", "lastPublishDate": "2019-08-24T00:11:29Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-08-24T00:11:29Z", "path": "/2019/08/23/us/houston-officers-charged-no-knock-raid", "source": "cnn", "location": null, "byLine": "By Hollie Silverman, Steve Almasy and Phil Gast, CNN", "contributors": ["Hollie Silverman", "Steve Almasy", "Phil Gast"], "headline": "Former Houston officer accused of lying to get warrant faces murder charges after botched raid", "section": "us", "mappedSection": "US", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190128184712-houston-police-shooting-aerial-story-body.jpg", "tags": [{"id": "fd529c2d-a4f7-4f7e-b39a-850e8a28c03f"}, {"id": "b21c6c7c-6fe4-4f10-85da-b81821c55578"}, {"id": "79e68efe-c60a-4a30-a061-75907457608a"}, {"id": "3512d6d8-b2e5-4f74-97f6-024ab343c13a"}, {"id": "40acf5f7-7996-4d60-bad2-489ef77cddf4"}, {"id": "8d7177ef-0a7e-44b5-9a58-6c98c0968023"}, {"id": "86f1d6f8-6a48-4e2c-8c1c-d3a9cbc794c2"}, {"id": "bbeba556-f98f-4db4-bbee-d73b417eb1c3"}, {"id": "05128cf4-78a5-44b4-9130-89fedf9e204e"}, {"id": "5da77f4f-b1c0-4f34-85db-e9e8ec049abe"}, {"id": "5650d962-d7f0-5810-89b5-67dd679215a0"}, {"id": "c848cd45-fe32-4a2a-acaa-e000873c76d7"}, {"id": "c848cd45-fe32-4a2a-acaa-e000873c76d7"}, {"id": "c848cd45-fe32-4a2a-acaa-e000873c76d7"}, {"id": "58da1feb-6773-40a4-bb2c-2267f06c5689"}, {"id": "58da1feb-6773-40a4-bb2c-2267f06c5689"}, {"id": "7f9e3331-436d-4b95-8a53-05c644fe2597"}, {"id": "524bdf78-fed5-5bc1-8c22-51da19e73867"}, {"id": "524bdf78-fed5-5bc1-8c22-51da19e73867"}, {"id": "c7e52082-094d-5d63-b82e-4b8d5a9048b9"}, {"id": "7f50cde6-db70-455f-86f5-4df7e10638a5"}, {"id": "7f50cde6-db70-455f-86f5-4df7e10638a5"}, {"id": "7f50cde6-db70-455f-86f5-4df7e10638a5"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}, {"id": "2a1fbdb6-333a-4b46-9ec8-29ca034d21ad"}, {"id": "28d880a2-7751-4914-8fc2-ea71eb30debc"}, {"id": "c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d"}, {"id": "3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734"}, {"id": "bfbad1a7-137f-47f7-9126-daaaf3f3984c"}, {"id": "367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6"}, {"id": "b852b5d8-31c6-49e9-8ff1-986a55356fa1"}, {"id": "15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158"}, {"id": "7bacc4f5-0758-4abd-a57e-c3633bd0f1aa"}, {"id": "3f9c3ae3-f072-4733-ad97-4748ce5e9bba"}, {"id": "b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c"}, {"id": "ba149945-03c8-4584-83c3-13dd4e4b89cd"}, {"id": "c8456516-b9be-42bc-ac2f-c96364001bee"}, {"id": "aa67276b-8530-439b-914f-1be2979f9bc7"}, {"id": "fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9"}, {"id": "1804359b-a654-428b-8e8a-d081c8ade29a"}, {"id": "7f601bec-88f1-403a-bd1f-b1529280db2c"}, {"id": "9c5826c0-329c-54ce-b065-3826ae02b3ab"}, {"id": "f0a0d4d0-7cb3-5328-89b8-73721db659bf"}, {"id": "371d0edb-606f-5060-9394-aa93235b9684"}, {"id": "edda3d1f-f4cb-474b-b0bd-3ebcc85ef274"}, {"id": "9e77e33a-ec67-5055-bb7a-f945a97882b6"}, {"id": "12967d01-3194-4c24-b4a8-91f471860718"}, {"id": "8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e"}], "tickers": []}, {"_id": "h_280b5b32f9319f54157f7772608c7b84", "type": "article", "body": "If you've seen a message going around Instagram warning people about a privacy policy change, don't bother sharing.

The President yesterday\u00a0told reporters he is \"seriously\" considering ending US birthright citizenship,\u00a0even though such a move would face immediate legal challenge and is at odds with Supreme Court precedent and, well, the 14th Amendment. This is far from the first time Trump has talked about ending the\u00a0process by which babies born in the country automatically become citizens, and such hard-line anti-immigration proposals\u00a0are popular with his base. What might not play as well? Using messianic language -- about yourself.\u00a0Speaking to reporters at the White House about trade relations with China, Trump paused and pointed to the heavens, saying, \"I'm the chosen one.\" He'd earlier thanked a\u00a0conspiracy theorist\u00a0who described him\u00a0as being like the King of Israel and said Jews \"love him like the second coming of God.\" He also\u00a0joked to a group of veterans about giving himself the Medal of Honor, which\u00a0recognizes the highest levels of military valor. 2. Foiled mass shootings\u00a0\u00a0 The aftershocks of this month's mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso continue to reverberate in frightening ways. At least 27 people have been arrested over threats to commit mass attacks since the pair of shootings a few weeks ago. A significant number of these threats have come from teenagers making violent promises from the perceived anonymity of the internet, and several more credible threats were racially motivated: A 35-year-old man was arrested in Seattle after threatening to kill people and calling for the \"extermination\" of Hispanics, and a\u00a0self-described white nationalist threatened to attack an Ohio-area Jewish center. After the two shootings in early August, the FBI announced it would ask\u00a0agency offices nationwide to conduct new threat assessments to hopefully thwart more mass attacks. The agency said in a statement it was concerned extremists would see the attacks as an opportunity to \"engage in similar acts of violence.\" 3. Rudy Giuliani\u00a0 It appears Rudy Giuliani is still invested\u00a0in getting the Ukrainian government to investigate President Trump's political enemies. The former New York City mayor said he spoke with a Ukrainian official about 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who investigated Biden's son.\u00a0Giuliani has directly pursued Ukrainian investigations into American politics for the better part of a year now, although he claims he hasn't done so at Trump's request. As for how that relates to the Biden situation,\u00a0Giuliani has long been pressuring\u00a0Ukraine to investigate\u00a0a 2016 call Biden made\u00a0to remove a prosecutor who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company connected to Biden's son, Hunter. 4. Officer shootings In the last seven days,\u00a0there have been several shootings of police spanning five states,\u00a0from California to Pennsylvania. Luckily, none was fatal, but the cases have caught national attention and demonstrate the range of dangers officers face. The incidents\u00a0unfolded in varying ways: a\u00a0routine traffic stop in Texas, a deputy targeted by a sniper in California, a standoff in Missouri and a search warrant execution gone wrong in Illinois. Last week,\u00a0police serving a narcotics warrant in Philadelphia\u00a0were ambushed by a barrage of gunfire that left six officers wounded and sparked an eight-hour standoff; the suspect was eventually arrested. 5. Wildfires Forest fires are ravaging two very different parts of the world. In Alaska, the McKinley Fire has now spread to more than 4,300 acres and destroyed at least 80 structures. It's one of more than 50 wildfires burning throughout the country right now (summer is peak wildfire season in the US.) An even more ominous blaze is tearing through the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.\u00a0Fires are raging at a record rate in the region, and scientists warn that it could strike a devastating blow to the fight against climate change.\u00a0The Amazon is\u00a0the largest rainforest on the planet and produces\u00a020% of the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere. As trees fall to the fires, so too does the source of that oxygen. The forest is also home to uncountable species of plants and animals, all threatened by the blaze.\u00a0There have been 72,843 fires in Brazil this year, with more than half in the Amazon region. That's more than 80% more than\u00a0the same period last year.

The shootings were not fatal, and occurred during traffic stops, tense standoffs and in some cases ambushes while officers served warrants at homes.  Here's a breakdown of the officers shot in the past week:  California: A sniper aims at a deputy  A possible sniper took aim at a deputy in Southern California on Wednesday, hitting him with a bullet in the chest, authorities said. The unidentified deputy was in the parking lot of the Lancaster station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department when the shooter opened fire from a four-story complex across the street. The deputy was wearing a bulletproof vest, which saved his life by deflecting the bullet into his shoulder,  Lancaster Mayor R. Rex Parris said.  By early Thursday, a manhunt was underway for the shooter, and a nearby school was put on lockdown and students evacuated. Texas: An officer is shot at a routine stop A Texas deputy was shot multiple times after he approached a vehicle during a routine traffic stop in Houston, and his bulletproof vest likely saved his life, authorities said. Deputy Quinton Goodwill of Harris County was treated and released from the hospital Wednesday, the same day he was shot, CNN affiliate KTRK reported.  The shooting happened shortly after midnight after he stopped a car and the suspect opened fire, authorities said.  The suspect fled the scene but was arrested shortly after.  Missouri: Two officers are wounded in standoff A man surrendered Friday following a shooting and standoff that left a state trooper and a sheriff's deputy wounded in southern Missouri. The incident started when the man opened fire as troopers and deputies were attempting to serve an eviction notice, authorities said.  Missouri State Highway Patrol officers were assisting the Carter County Sheriff's Department deputies to serve the notice at a residence in Van Buren, Missouri.  \"A male suspect began firing from inside the residence,\" Missouri State Highway Patrol said in a statement.  The shooter barricaded himself in the home in a standoff that lasted eight hours and ended when he surrendered to a SWAT team.   Missouri Gov. Mike Parson said the attack was an \"ambush\" on local law enforcement. Illinois: An officer is shot at a home   An Illinois state trooper was shot while serving a search warrant at a home in Wheeling on Aug. 15, authorities said.  The officer was taken to the hospital, treated and released. The suspect is in custody.  Philadelphia: Six officers are injured    Just last week, police serving a narcotics warrant in Philadelphia were met by a barrage of gunfire that left six officers wounded. What followed was a tense standoff that lasted nearly eight hours and ended just after midnight Aug. 15.  The suspect emerged from a house with his arms held over his head. His surrender came after a conference call with his lawyer, the police commissioner and the district attorney.  The suspect, identified as  Maurice Hill, 36, has an extensive criminal history, police said. Texas: An officer and a suspect are wounded In Texas, police in Odessa responded to a call of shots fired on Aug. 14 and when they arrived, a man started shooting at officers, authorities said. An Odessa police officer was shot and taken to the hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening. The suspect was also shot and hospitalized with serious injuries, police said. All three officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave. \"As with all officer-involved shootings, the Odessa Police Department has requested the Texas Rangers office investigate,\" police said.

Dawnta Harris admitted to police that he fatally struck Officer Amy Caprio with a Jeep Wrangler in May 2018 when he was 16. The officer was trying to get the teenager to get out of the vehicle.  His attorney, Warren A. Brown, told CNN he had asked for a 30-year sentence for Harris, but the case was \"pretty gruesome\" and widely publicized. \"The judge was under a lot of scrutiny,\" Brown told CNN.  Brown said he thinks the judge was fair because the guidelines for felony murder call for a life sentence.  Caprio was investigating a report of a possible burglary when she asked Harris to get out of the Jeep. The driver instead ran her over, police said after Harris was arrested.  Harris admitted to police that he was waiting in the driver's seat of the Jeep as associates were committing a burglary, according to court documents.

Diesel Pippert, a seventh grader from Huron County, Ohio, will donate every penny of his auction proceeds to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Diesel's generous decision stemmed from a bit of friendly competition. He'd heard about a teen in nearby Medina County who auctioned off his hog for $11,000 and donated the proceeds to the nonprofit children's hospital in Memphis. So he set out to one-up him, his mother Erin Sanders told CNN.  He told Saturday's crowd at the Huron County Fair large animal sale about his plans. Auctioneers started the bidding for Diesel's hog at $500, and quickly grew from there. By the time the final bidder lowered their paddle, the boy had raised $15,000, Sanders said.  Diesel's a regular at the fair, his mother said.  He's auctioned off pigs, cows and dairy steer since age 9. Now, she hopes he'll keep up his giving streak and donate his earnings to St. Jude every year.  \"Our hearts are full of joy,\" she said. \"He's a remarkable young man.\"  The family's planning a visit to the Memphis hospital, Sanders said, where they'll hand-deliver toys and games to the pediatric patients.  Western Reserve Schools superintendent Rodge Wilson said he wasn't surpised when he heard about Diesel's good deed. In a Facebook post, the school district called the 12-year-old a \"hero.\"  \"We're very proud of what an upstanding young man he is,\" he said.  Cynthia Gardner, regional executive director of American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC), St. Jude's fundraising and awareness organization, called Diesel's compassion commendable.  \"His kindness demonstrates that age does not limit kids from fundraising and making a difference in the lives of other children battling cancer at St. Jude,\" she said in a statement to CNN.
