"WASHINGTON — President Trump pressed the Ukrainian president in a July call to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son, according to a person familiar with the conversation, an apparently blatant mixture of foreign policy with his 2020 re-election campaign. Mr. Trump also repeatedly told the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, to talk with his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had been urging the government in Kiev to investigate Mr. Biden and his family, according to two other people briefed on the call. Mr. Trump’s request is part of the secret whistle-blower complaint that is said to be about Mr. Trump and at least in part about  his dealings with Ukraine , according to two people familiar with the complaint. Mr. Biden is a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. The president has made no secret that he wanted Ukraine to investigate any improper overlap between Mr. Biden’s own diplomatic efforts there and his son’s role with a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. “Someone ought to look into Joe Biden,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday in response to a question about his call with Mr. Zelensky. The revelations added urgency to questions about Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, which is battling Russian-controlled separatists in the country’s east. When the president sought the Biden investigation, the Trump administration’s military aid to Ukraine had been frozen for weeks. The United States suspended that assistance in early July, according to a former American official. Mr. Trump did not discuss the aid in the July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky, whose government did not learn of the suspension until August, according to people familiar with the call. The Wall Street Journal  first reported  details of the call. For Democrats who want to examine the whistle-blower complaint — itself the subject of  an internal administration dispute  over whether to hand it over to Congress, as is generally required by law — the key question is whether Mr. Trump was demanding a quid pro quo, explicitly or implicitly. Democratic House committee chairmen  are already investigating  whether he manipulated American foreign policy for personal political advantage and have requested the transcript of the Zelensky call. The growing controversy had echoes of the dominant scandal of the first years of Mr. Trump’s administration: whether his campaign sought help from Russia to benefit him in 2016. Ultimately,  the special counsel found  that although “insufficient evidence” existed to determine that Mr. Trump or his advisers engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the Russians, his campaign welcomed Moscow’s election sabotage and expected to benefit from it. Any attempt by Mr. Trump to ask a foreign power to “dig up dirt” on a political rival while withholding aid is corrupt, said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, one of the panels examining Mr. Trump’s Ukraine dealings. “No explicit quid pro quo is necessary to betray your country,”  tweeted Mr. Schiff , who has also pushed for the whistle-blower complaint to be given to Congress. Mr. Trump opened a direct counterattack on Friday against the whistle-blower, whose identity is unknown, as are many details about the complaint. The president dismissed the allegations and labeled the whistle-blower, without evidence, a political partisan. “It’s a ridiculous story. It’s a partisan whistle-blower,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, though he acknowledged he did not know the person’s identity. “They shouldn’t even have information.” Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have pressed for an investigation of the Bidens for weeks, after reports this year in  The New York Times  and  elsewhere  examined whether a Ukrainian energy company sought to buy influence in Washington by hiring Mr. Biden’s younger son, Hunter Biden. The younger Biden had a lobbying business in Ukraine while his father was vice president. When he was vice president, Mr. Biden cast himself as both the Obama administration’s advocate of military assistance to Kiev as well as the chief antagonist of the notorious corruption in Ukraine’s government. In early 2016, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in American loan guarantees if Ukraine’s top prosecutor was not dismissed after accusations that he had ignored rampant corruption. Mr. Biden succeeded; the prosecutor general was voted out office. And Hunter Biden had an interest in the outcome: He sat on the board of an energy company that had been in the sights of the ousted prosecutor general. On Friday, the former vice president accused Mr. Trump in a statement of using the power of the United States to extract “a political favor.” Mr. Biden called for the president to release the transcript of his call with Mr. Zelensky and said that if the reports about it proved true, “there was no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.” He also said the allegations that he or his son committed wrongdoing in Ukraine were baseless. “Not one single outlet has given any credibility to his assertion,” Mr. Biden told reporters after a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Controversy over the Trump administration’s Ukraine policy has swirled for weeks but has been confined mostly to foreign policy experts. The revelations about the whistle-blower complaint plunged the issue into the center of the political debate. Congress has still not seen the whistle-blower’s allegation. Although the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, has sought to provide it, the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has blocked him in  a dispute over legal requirements . Mr. Maguire and his general counsel decided against providing the complaint to Congress after consulting with Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, according to a person familiar with the move. Mounting evidence that the White House was involved in the effort to withhold the complaint from lawmakers has stirred anger on Capitol Hill. Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Mr. Maguire of violating the law. “If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,” she added in a statement. Republicans were largely silent about Mr. Trump’s calls for a foreign investigation of his political rival. Their apparent desire to avoid criticizing the president during a political crisis stood in contrast to the criticism from party members after the administration froze aid to Ukraine. The administration, critics said, has struggled to explain the move, which has convinced some Democrats that it was part of an effort bring about a Biden investigation. “They have no shame,” said Michael Carpenter, a former aide to Mr. Biden and expert on Ukraine. He added: “They released the assistance in mid-September after the bipartisan uproar over the freeze — and under pressure from the House investigations. But strikingly, the administration never articulated why the assistance was frozen in the first place.” Mr. Giuliani has spearheaded a push for a Biden inquiry. He  met with Mr. Zelensky’s emissaries  this summer in hopes of encouraging his government to pursue investigations into the family as well as whether Ukrainian officials took steps during the 2016 election to damage Mr. Trump’s campaign. Mr. Giuliani has said he was acting on his own, though his comments on Thursday seemed to draw a closer connection to Mr. Trump. “A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job,”  Mr. Giuliani tweeted  shortly after  an appearance on CNN,  where he first denied, then admitted, asking the government in Kiev to investigate the Bidens. Although they agreed to meet with Mr. Giuliani, the Ukrainians have so far refused to open the investigations. But there is little doubt the pressure from Mr. Trump is causing stress on the new government, according to a former Ukrainian official. Since 2014, Ukraine has been under attack by Russia and its proxy, a fight that has become a grinding conflict that has made it difficult for Kiev to continue its overhaul efforts and work to become more integrated with Europe and the West. But now Ukraine also finds itself potentially at odds with the leader of its most critical partner, the United States, and at the center of a political battle in Washington. Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky  will meet next week  on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, a senior administration official confirmed on Friday after Mr. Zelensky’s office announced the meeting. But the administration has put off any commitment for a White House meeting, which Mr. Zelensky views as critical for the relationship."
"To the Editor: Re  “ Claim on Trump Is Said to Involve a Foreign Leader ” (front page, Sept. 20): Donald Trump has said, “ I have the right  to do whatever I want as president.” Indeed this is mostly true. The president not only has broad powers but he can even be spared legal consequences as long as he remains in office. This was made painfully clear in the Mueller investigation. There are, however, red lines. The founding fathers did allow for congressional oversight and action in the event of a bad actor who would use the office of the presidency in service of himself rather than in service of the country. Now there is a whistle-blower in the intelligence community who has urgent information about the president that he believes Congress needs to know. It is information that Mr. Trump and the Justice Department would rather see withheld from Congress. If speculations are true, and the president himself or through an emissary threatened to withhold vital military aid to Ukraine if it did not investigate business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden’s son or pursue a corruption investigation of Mr. Biden himself, that type of quid pro quo would be deeply troubling. It is the definition of politically self-serving. Lawlessness is rampant in the Trump administration. If we want to restore the rule of law to our republic and faith in our democracy, we must insist that the whistle-blower be permitted to speak, come what may.  Felicia Massarsky Atlantic City To the Editor: The  legacy of President Trump will be a field of horrors stretching to the horizon, but interrupted by a few bits of important insight into the flaws in our democracy. Who would have thought a president would refuse to disclose his potentially conflicting business interests, then use his powers to enhance those very interests? Who would have thought that the nation’s chief executive would dispatch a lackey to threaten his duly appointed attorney general with professional execution if he didn’t reverse a principled decision? Who would have thought that in service of his re-election, the leader of the nation might have tried to enlist a foreign power to conduct an investigation of his likely political opponent? Yes, one day we’ll look back on these times with disgust, but it will be seasoned with a pinch of sardonic gratitude to the man who showed us where we might find the cracks in what we thought was the seamless wall of our democracy.

"The Wall Street Journal reports that in a July phone call, President Trump repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son. The controversy over President Trump’s  mysterious call  with a foreign leader that prompted a whistleblower complaint ratcheted up Friday afternoon as a new report said it involved Trump asking the president of Ukraine numerous times in a single phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. Meanwhile, after Trump called the whistleblower a partisan and dismissed the allegation as “another political hack job,” Democrats in Congress accused the president of trying to intimidate whistleblowers and demanded the administration hand over the complaint and a transcript of the call, while 2020 hopefuls renewed calls for impeachment. CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. In a lengthy statement Friday evening, Biden said that if the reports were true ""there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.  ""This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,"" Biden continued. ""It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation—a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia—pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor ..."" ""At minimum,"" Biden concluded, ""Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress."" What initially touched off the  controversy is a secret  whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM   Trump called that initial story “ridiculous” in the Oval Office, and said he doesn’t know the identity of the whistleblower. He wouldn’t say what was discussed in the call but said someone should “look into” Biden family connections to Ukraine. ""I have conversations with many leaders. It's always appropriate. Always appropriate,"" Trump said. ""At the highest level, always appropriate. And anything I do, I fight for this country."" Afterward, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democratic committee leaders issued a statement demanding the administration hand over the complaint, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would not share details of it with lawmakers. “President Trump just went on national television—from the Oval Office—and personally attacked an Intelligence Community whistleblower who reported an urgent matter involving serious or flagrant misconduct,"" the statement said, adding that the ""brazen effort to intimidate this whistleblower risks a chilling effect on future whistleblowers."" After the publication of the Journal’s story, 2020 Democrats quickly weighed in. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro said that Trump “is a criminal.” “He must be impeached immediately,” he said. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said that Trump “appears to be collaborating with foreign governments to attack America’s democracy” before she urged the whistleblower to come forward. “I would absolutely urge this whistleblower to go directly to Congress, whether in closed session or in open session,” she said. Schiff told reporters Friday that the whistleblower claim ""deserves a thorough investigation."" ""Come hell or high water, that’s what we’re going to do,” he said. Democrats have been looking into whether Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure the government to investigate the Biden activities, and have also sought a transcript of the July call between Trump and Zelensky. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The inspector general for the intelligence community received the whistleblower complaint and, according to correspondence with Schiff, considered the allegations “credible” and dealing with an “urgent concern.” Inspector General Michael Atkinson wrote that the DNI, “after consulting with the Department of Justice,” determined the complaint does not have to be shared with the intelligence committees under law. He wrote that he will “abide by that determination,” but disagrees with it. In a letter Tuesday, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of ""urgent concern."" He said the complaint ""concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision."" Maguire is expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. after being subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee. Schiff had accused Maguire of withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioned whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general. Fox News' Alex Pappas, Hillary Vaughn, Andrew Craft and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"True to form the President and his confederates are only adding to the chaos. In response to questioning from CNN's Chis Cuomo Thursday night, for example, Trump's personal lawyer and TV attack dog,  Rudolph Giuliani, both denied and confirmed  that the controversy may have to do with the fact that Giuliani has urged Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden is leading the pack of Democrats hoping to oppose Trump in 2020. Could it be that the President's lawyer is mixing politics and policy in an unsavory way?   As usual it's hard to follow the action, but what is known thus far should worry us all. According to various news outlets, the White House and Justice Department told the inspector general for intelligence matters there was nothing to the whistleblower's report that a high level official, most likely the President, communicated in some untoward way with a foreign leader. Under apparent pressure from the White House and Justice, the acting director of national intelligence blocked the intelligence IG from notifying Congress of the complaint, sidestepping a law requiring this. Now Capitol Hill leaders and the administration are battling over  just who has a right  to see the complaint. In a normal, pre-Trump Washington, the issue of such a complaint would have been handled in a routine, if not collegial, way. But in this era, when the White House stonewalls as a matter of course, such a conflict seems inevitable—and, too, that the President would act in a way so heedless that some intelligence professional would sound an alarm But this new crisis is completely in character for Trump, who has always operated as if personal relationships, and his self-interest, are all that really matter in every context. In every organization he has ever led, from his businesses in New York to the US government he has insisted on being the sole authority and expert, a man who ignored the rules as a matter of routine. During his decades as a real estate developer and entertainer,  Trump's style meant that he controlled  all of the many hundreds of entities under his organization's umbrella, and those who worked below him were charged with making sure his decisions -- whether good or bad -- turn out for the best, while he claimed credit for successes and dodged accountability for failures.  Then, and apparently now, Trump relied on his instinct, which often got him into big trouble. Multiple bankruptcies proved that Trump's decision-making gut is a less-than-perfect instrument. Upon examining his failures,  Susan Craig, of The New York Times, declared,  ""We found most of it was just bad business.""  As President, Trump has depended on unconventional operatives like Giuliani to help him in an unofficial capacity. For months Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, has been trying to stir up concerns about Biden and his son Hunter's involvement with a Ukrainian energy firm. An official in that country  told The Daily Beast  that Trump is seeking compromising information. Trump himself  has said ""it doesn't matter""  if the President of the United States is engaged in this slimy business. In comments to reporters Friday,  he added:  ""I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate.""    Hope for real clarity on the matter is dimmed by the fact that Trump enjoys rubber-stamp support from the Republican-controlled Senate, which has approved nearly all of his nominees for federal positions only to see  a record number leave their posts in short order.  Most recently Trump was forced to withdraw his nominee for the top job at the Federal Emergency Management Agency amid an FBI investigation. FEMA is part of the  Department of Homeland Security, where ""acting"" officials are found in striking numbers  at the top of the organizational chart.  ""Actings"" are running things across the administration. In fact, the director of national intelligence caught up in the latest mess, Joseph Maguire, is on temporary assignment and, therefore, lacking the gravitas of an appointee who really owns the job. Although officials who lack permanent status surely suffer for it, their insecurity seems to suit Trump's seat-of-the-pants style.  He has said he prefers provisional appointees  because they are more readily moved in and out of positions. They might also be assumed to be more vulnerable to whatever pressure the White House applied.  The downside, of course, is that ""acting"" leaders may struggle to get anything done or to win the respect of their troops. (Imagine, for example, an army going into battle under a general whose stars were applied with Velcro and whose orders are under constant presidential review.)      Indeed, Trump has spent his life making sure that those who serve him feel like they are never quite secure, while at the same time he has sought to make himself immune to examination. As President,  he has long banned note-takers  from some talks with foreign leaders and then limited White House reporting on his phone calls with them.  The current whistleblower controversy appears to be yet another case of Trump seeking ways to avoid accountability. The  Washington Post reported  that White House records indicate that that Trump had had ""conversations or interactions with at least five foreign leaders in the preceding five weeks"": Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani.  CNN reported Thursday that the White House and the Justice Department told the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that the nature of the whistleblower complaint isn't covered by laws governing intelligence whistleblowers.   According to CNN : ""Previously the White House has cited longstanding precedent in refusing congressional requests for documents related to Trump's meetings with his Russian counterpart. 'It is settled law that the Constitution entrusts the conduct of foreign relations exclusively to the Executive Branch, as it makes the President 'the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations,'  White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote in a letter to Democrats in May."" The President defends his secretive dealings with foreign leaders by insisting that America's international success depends on his personal rapport with them. He says he has great relationships with the likes of Putin, North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un, China' President Xi and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.   Russia, China, North Korea and Saudi Arabia have all caused trouble to America during the Trump era, and his brand of personal politics hasn't seemed to help any. Instead, it has reinforced the suspicions that many held toward Trump when he was just a self-promoting businessman. Back then, of course, his business was his business. Today, he acts on behalf of the American people. Earning their trust requires that he follow the rules.     "
"""The president asked a foreign power to help him win an election. Again,"" the former secretary of state tweeted, referring to Trump's call during the 2016 race for Russia to look into Clinton's deleted emails. Clinton's tweet included a video of  Giuliani's comments on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time""  Thursday, when Chris Cuomo pressed the former New York mayor over conversations he'd had with a  Ukrainian official  about Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who had investigated the former vice president's son, Hunter. ""Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?"" Cuomo asked Giuliani.  ""No, actually I didn't. I asked the Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016 by the Ukrainians for the benefit of Hillary Clinton, for which there is already a court finding,"" Giuliani responded. ""You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden and his role with the prosecutor?"" Cuomo asked. ""The only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that (Yuriy) Lutsenko, who was appointed, dismissed the case,"" Giuliani said. ""So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?"" Cuomo pressed. ""Of course I did,"" Giuliani said. When asked about his contradicting answer, Giuliani said he ""didn't ask"" for Biden to be investigated specifically, but asked Ukraine ""to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme."" Asked Friday if he discussed the former vice president with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed"" but that someone should look into Biden. During the 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump called on Russia, China and other hackers to turn over Clinton's emails. ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump said in July 2016.  Then-White House press secretary  Sean Spicer later said Trump was ""joking""  when he publicly asked Russia to hack his Democratic rival."
"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — College students are back on campus.  Bernie Sanders  is, too. Earlier this month at Iowa State University, he lectured to young voters as they played “Green New Deal Pong” (the  Solo cups  were filled with green-colored water) and “Bern Bag Toss.”  At the University of Nevada, Reno,  he croaked through a hoarse voice to address a crowd that stretched from the college lawn to the open-air floors of a  parking garage beside it. And at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Thursday evening, he implored students to get themselves to the primary polls come February — and vote for him. “You have friends out there, and I know you do, who think that the political system” is absurd, he said, using a colorful expletive. “Tell them that instead of just complaining, they must get involved into the political process.” It was a sentiment he has repeated often this month as he crisscrossed the country on what has amounted to a whirlwind back-to-school tour. In Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina, he has by turns used flattery (“Your generation is the most progressive younger generation in the history of this country”) and subtle warnings (“The future of this country and in fact the world rests with your generation”) to bolster his appeals. Everywhere, his goal was the same: muster a version of the army of young voters who propelled his campaign in 2016. His message was one that has resonated with Brianna Williams, 19, who arrived with a group of friends to hear him in Chapel Hill .  “I’ve seen a lot of his policies, and I’m just excited for what he has to offer as a candidate,” she said. But she was just as excited by Senator Elizabeth Warren. “I would love to see a woman running the country,” she said. “That would be really cool.” Last time around, Mr. Sanders’s rants against the elite and promises of free college tuition endeared him to legions of young fans. It also helped that Mr. Sanders —  74  at the time, with unruly white hair and an old-school Brooklyn accent — was both decidedly uncool and new to presidential politics, affording his campaign a paradoxical edge that inspired millions of young supporters to “feel the bern” and vote for him over Hillary Clinton.  As he fights anew for the Democratic nomination, it is not lost on him or his allies that his success hinges, in no small part, on his ability to capture that enthusiasm again —  for both the optics of his race and the actual votes.   But this time he is no longer an insurgent, nor is he the only anti-establishment candidate in the race — factors that helped boost his standing among young voters. With the race entering the crucial fall period, other candidates, including Ms. Warren and Andrew Yang, have begun siphoning off some of his support. [ Sign up for our politics newsletter  hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race. ] Even Mr. Sanders’s closest advisers acknowledge that he cannot take for granted a voting cohort they view as critical, even if it is traditionally unreliable in actually making it to the ballot box. “Last time it was much more organic,” Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, said. “And this time it’s far more intentional.” In interviews, many young voters still praised Mr. Sanders, sometimes breathlessly — citing his authenticity and conviction but also his calls for free college and universal health care and his proposal to cancel student debt. But many also expressed curiosity, if not exuberance, about other candidates  “I love everything he stands for,” said Asha Loutsch, 18, as she sat with a circle of friends who were waiting for his event at the University of Iowa. “I think he really cares about what he’s trying to say. Like, he’s always getting up in there, you know?” But she also said she was interested in Ms. Warren and wanted to hear her speak. Jiego Lim, an 18-year-old student at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was volunteering at Mr. Sanders’s event there, said he supported Mr. Sanders but was also intrigued by Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris. “I feel like we need a fresh new face in politics,” he said. “Bernie comes off aggressive to me sometimes.” Others were less equivocal.  “He’s America’s dad,” offered Gabriel Olier, 19, a student in Reno. “I love Bernie.” That affection for Mr. Sanders is reflected in some more tangible metrics. His campaign said it had so far raised over $1 million from people under the age of 25, a relatively small figure compared to his overall haul but one that nevertheless points to his continued strength with young voters. [ Here’s the latest data  on who’s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] And in most polls, Mr. Sanders still maintains a strong lead among young voters:  A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey  showed that a third of voters under 35 supported him. Yet at the same time, a quarter of these respondents said they supported Ms. Warren , suggesting Mr. Sanders no longer has the same hold on the group he had in 2016. Any candidate relying on the support of younger voters faces an undeniable challenge: Younger voters tend not to vote in high numbers compared with other groups. In the 2016 election, for instance, only  11 percent of voters  under 30 participated in the Iowa caucuses, representing just 15 percent of the total, according to an estimate from the  Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and  Engagement   at Tufts University. But the high turnout among young voters during the 2018 midterm elections has given some experts hope that the 2020 election will be different. That strong showing has provided organizers with a larger pool to identify and target potential presidential voters. Issues, including climate change, criminal justice, health care and gun control, are also motivating young voters to act. “The truth is that if younger people in this country voted at the same level as people 65 and over, we could transform this country,” Mr. Sanders said this month at the University of Iowa. “Please do it!” John Della Volpe , the director of polling at Harvard’s  Institute of Politics , said that Mr. Sanders was still “doing really well” but that the field was more complex and his pool of support was smaller. “At this stage, he’s essentially sharing support of young people in most polls with Elizabeth Warren,” Mr. Della Volpe said. “The idea of going after structural reforms is really, I think, what is resonating so clearly with young people.” Indeed, of all the other candidates, it is Ms. Warren who appears to be generating the most powerful wave of energy among young voters in Democratic presidential politics — particularly among those who once supported Mr. Sanders. Olivia Stecklein, 19, a student at the University of Iowa, said she had been a fan of Mr. Sanders since 2015 but was now choosing between him and Ms. Warren. “I feel like they’re pretty similar, but I just kind of like how Elizabeth Warren has a set-out plan for everything,” she said. “She just seems very prepared.” Eliza Link, 18, a University of Iowa student, said she was also deciding between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. “I think they’re both the cool aunt and uncle of the political race right now,” she said. With his characteristic verve that can exhaust even young reporters, Mr. Sanders has been in an all-out sprint to earn the vote of the youths, months before any of them can even cast their vote.  His team set up a Bernie Summer School program to train campus leaders in the art of campaigning. He urged his campaign to get him back on college campuses in the first weeks of the new school year. He constantly asks his team to share data on young voters. To win over the group, however, Mr. Sanders will have to convince people like Tim Watts, 19. Before Mr. Sanders’s event in Reno, Mr. Watts wore a “MATH” hat, the universal accessory of Yang supporters. But despite his overt support for Mr. Yang — who in some ways is benefiting from the outsider status among young voters that Mr. Sanders enjoyed in 2016 — Mr. Watts said he had not yet closed the door on Mr. Sanders. “I’m part of the Yang gang, I guess,” he said. “I will probably feel the bern later.” Rachel Shorey contributed reporting from Washington."

"The affair, centering on Trump's contacts with a leader of a mystery foreign nation -- identified in two reports as Ukraine -- has also injected a toxic element into relations among the President, the intelligence community and Congress. It is hard to see how any of this ends well. Six months after special counsel Robert Mueller shut up shop, the White House again faces suspicion over Trump's dealings with a foreign power and seems to be taking steps to stop the full story from coming out. Democrats are rummaging for new skeletons in Trump's closet and yet another showdown is developing between the executive and Congress that appears almost certain to play out in the courts. The details of the controversy unleashed  when a whistleblower sounded the alarm  about the President are complex, disputed according to political allegiance and largely not public. The Washington Post  and  The New York Times  reported Thursday that the contacts at issue between Trump and the foreign leader involve Ukraine. In the past, some of Trump's supporters, including his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, have urged the Kiev government to open investigations that the President could use to raise suspicions about his political rivals, including Joe Biden. In a  heated exchange with CNN's Chris Cuomo  on Thursday night, Giuliani denied asking Ukraine to investigate the former vice president, before admitting he had done just that. The US and Ukraine were in discussions about $250 million in military aid to Kiev this summer that had been delayed by the White House. Giuliani said he didn't know anything about the package, but that if Trump had used it as leverage to benefit himself politically in any way he would not have done anything wrong.  ""The reality is that the President of the United States, whoever he is, has every right to tell the president of another country you better straighten out the corruption in your country if you want me to give you a lot of money. If you're so damn corrupt that you can't investigate allegations -- our money is going to get squandered,"" Giuliani said.  T rump attempted to discredit the whistleblower as ""highly partisan"" in a series of tweets Friday morning, echoing remarks made by Giuliani on Thursday night. The President said his comments to ""a certain foreign leader"" were ""pitch perfect."" Trump tweeted: ""Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!"" Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. There is so far no public evidence that the whistleblower's complaint pertains to this conversation or that there was any abuse of power by Trump. The White House later lifted the hold on aid.  But the potential ramifications of this new storm are already becoming clear and the risks facing the President, the intelligence community and Democrats in Congress are climbing by the day. Disturbing possibilities There must at least be a possibility that Trump abused his power or committed a grievous ethical lapse in dealing with the foreign leader. His defense was not exactly reassuring, considering some of the wild comments the President has made in the company of rogue counterparts such as Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un. ""Is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call?"" Trump tweeted on Thursday. CNN reported Thursday  that the intelligence community inspector general suggested to the House Intelligence Committee that the complaint raised concerns about multiple actions. He would not say whether those instances involved   Trump, sources familiar with the closed-door briefing told CNN. The inspector general, Michael Atkinson, was legally unable to discuss the complaint itself, since Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has declined to hand it over. Democrats say he is compelled to provide the complaint under whistleblower legislation, and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said his committee may take legal action if it isn't turned over. The Washington Post on Wednesday  said the complaint referenced a ""promise"" Trump allegedly made to the unidentified leader. CNN has not confirmed that aspect of the controversy. The whistleblower didn't have direct knowledge of the communications, an official briefed on the matter told CNN. Instead, the whistleblower's concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration's determination that the complaint didn't fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said. It is hard to know the potential exposure faced by the President. But given the sensitivity of the issue, the complaint is likely to have come from an official familiar with the scope of presidential power. And it was signed off as ""urgent and credible"" by the inspector general -- a Trump appointee -- who thought Congress should know in line with whistleblowing laws. The implication of such a fact pattern is staggering and opens up the potential of serious misconduct inside the White House -- despite Trump's denials of any wrongdoing. A President maligned?  If, on the other hand, the alleged behavior by the President does not reach such a bar, the political fallout will be considerable. Trump, acting within his wide Article Two constitutional powers, may have been maligned and there will be accusations that the whistleblower -- though moving within the scope of the law -- will have overreached. The President's suspicion of the intelligence community, which he sees as a ""Deep State"" bent on overthrowing him, will grow. If a president cannot trust his own spies, and thinks they are working against him and not the country's enemies, then America's national security will be harmed. The President's allies are already arguing that the controversy is simply another ruse by House Democrats to damage Trump. ""He has very wide authority, really unchecked authority, to talk to world leaders about anything he deems appropriate as he is representing the United States of America,"" said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union.""If this were able to go forward, any staffer in an agency could constantly hobble a Democratic President, duly elected."" ""This is an unconstitutional argument,"" Schlapp said on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Of course, the White House could clear all this up by explaining the contents of the alleged contacts between the President and the foreign leader. But it is taking the opposite tack. According to three CNN sources , the White House and the Justice Department advised the director of national intelligence that the complaint isn't governed by laws covering intelligence whistleblowers. The revelation is the first known evidence of the White House's involvement in the standoff. There may be an argument that the content of the President's communications or an official's impressions of them sent to Congress are subject to executive privilege. But the administration's resistance to scrutiny is already fueling suspicions of a cover-up. And it throws new light on the role of Attorney General William Barr -- who has been accused by critics of shaping special counsel Robert Mueller's damning revelations to the President's advantage. Barr, who served in the same role for President George H.W. Bush, advocates a theory of expansive presidential power, one reason why he has become perhaps Trump's favorite Cabinet member. Whistleblowers exposed House Democrats argue that the White House is yet again adopting a model of presidential power that threatens to tear the checks and balances of the US system to shreds. Schiff effectively argued that the approach taken by the administration could lead to the quashing of whistleblower claims in the government. That could lead down a road of power without accountability and in theory impunity for any presidential wrongdoing. ""The impact of this opinion is that if the Department of Justice decides that any employee of the intelligence committee comes forward, follows the law, follows the process, is nonetheless outside the process, they're not protected,"" the California Democrat said. ""Which not only means this whistleblower is not protected, it means no whistleblower is protected. That is the danger of the DOJ's misinterpretation of the law."" The fresh confrontation between the White House and the Congress is certain to fuel the frustration of Democrats at the White House's efforts to evade scrutiny. And it will add momentum to claims of many grass roots liberals and a growing corps of House Democrats who do not share House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reluctance to proceed with impeachment."
"""Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion,"" Biden said Friday. ""Not one single one, and so I have no comment except the President should start to be president."" Biden said no more about the issue as he and his staff loaded into a van to depart the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, after hosting a town hall on Friday afternoon.  His remarks came as a communication between Trump and a foreign leader prompted  a whistleblower complaint that is now at the center of a dispute  between the director of national intelligence and Congress. The whistleblower's complaint deals at least in part with Ukraine, The New York Times and Washington Post reported Thursday night, prompting speculation that it could be tied to reports that the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, had asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.  Trump pressed Ukraine's President to investigate Hunter Biden during a call earlier this summer, a person familiar with the situation said Friday. In 2014, while Biden was vice president under President Barack Obama, Hunter Biden joined the board of a natural gas company called Burisma owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. In 2016, while Burisma was being investigated, Western governments, including the Obama administration, called for the removal of Ukraine's top prosecutor due to concerns about corruption in his office. Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor wasn't let go. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  On Thursday, Giuliani denied asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden but moments later said he had done just that. Giuliani's comments came in a heated exchange on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" as Chris Cuomo pressed the former New York mayor over conversations he'd had with a Ukrainian official about Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of the prosecutor -- who had investigated Burisma. Earlier Friday,  Trump continued to blast news of the whistleblower complaint  in the Oval Office, calling it ""a ridiculous story."" ""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" he said, adding, ""It's just another political hack job.""  Trump said he doesn't know the identity of the person who made the complaint. Later Friday, Biden released a statement about the whistleblower complaint, saying: ""If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump's willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. ... At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress."" UPDATE: This story has been updated with additional context about the lack of evidence to support the allegations against the Bidens. "
"HOUSTON — A groan erupted at a  debate  watch party at Texas Southern University last week as former vice president  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  got a question about slavery and racism and  gave an answer about Venezuela and record players .  But amid that exasperation, some students channeled their inner Beltway operatives and began a targeted  rapid-response campaign.   Tyler Smith, 19, texted his grandmother after the debate, hopeful that Mr. Biden's meandering answer may have swayed her from supporting him.  Amaya St. Romain, 19, mounted a three-day lobbying blitz on her mother and her great-grandmother, making sure they had seen the former housing secretary  Julián Castro ’s criticisms of Mr. Biden onstage.  In  meme-speak ,  the efforts amounted to Killmonger, the villain in the Black Panther movie, challenging the people of Wakanda:  “Is this your king?”   “I think I’m definitely influencing them,” Ms. St. Romain said of her family members. “But my dad is definitely still pro-Biden. And I don’t really argue with him.”  If Mr. Biden,  76 , is going to win the  Democratic nomination , it is likely to be because of the  support of older black voters , a key constituency for the party  and one that polls show is overwhelmingly supportive of the former vice president’s candidacy .  But if he is to be overtaken by one of his more progressive rivals, the most powerful tool against him may not be opposition research or negative advertisements. Instead, it may be an organic effort by younger black voters — concerned about Mr. Biden’s age and more moderate ideology — to sway their older family members. Mr. Biden seems aware of this dynamic. In interviews, he has both acknowledged the generational gap among his black supporters and downplayed its importance,  arguing that the support of older, more moderate black voters  would be enough to give him an electoral advantage.  Still, Mr. Biden, by his own admission, would be unwise to underestimate the lobbying efforts of those who are young and politically engaged. At a gathering of the New Hampshire Young Democrats in July, Mr. Biden said the same phenomenon — young people converting their skeptical parents — had helped fuel his own ascension in politics almost 47 years ago, when he was elected to the Senate as a fresh-faced 29-year-old.  “The fact of the matter is, you have more influence on how your parents vote than they have on you,” Mr. Biden  said  in July. “You may sit at the dining room table, having dinner with your mom and dad, and say, ‘I met her and I really like her,’ or ‘I met him and I really like him.’ And your parents will pretend it didn’t matter much. But they’ll go up, not a joke, they’ll go up and say, ‘If my kid liked that person that much, and knew them, there must be something there.’”  At Texas Southern University, a historically black university founded in 1927 and the site of last week’s Democratic debate, dozens of students, ages 19 to 23, differed on their top candidate. Senators  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont,  Elizabeth Warren  of Massachusetts, and  Kamala Harris  of California were among the favorites, as was one of the two Texans in the race, former Representative  Beto O’Rourke .  For Mr. Biden, though, students carried mixed feelings. They respected his tenure as Barack Obama’s vice president, but implicitly rejected his campaign’s central premise, that the primary goal of Democrats in the 2020 election should be defeating President Trump.  They pointed to systemic problems they said the country must address, such as inequality, climate change and gun violence. The Democratic nominee, they said, should embrace progressive proposals like canceling student loan debt, the Green New Deal and gun buyback programs.  “Me and my dad have the debate all the time,” said Samantha Williams, 19, a sophomore. “We want a candidate that reflects us and what the world is going to look like when we run. But  he  says what we call ‘woke’ is really just sensitive.”  Jaylan Jones, 20, said, “Older people have that conservative outlook on things,” even older black Democrats.  “Young people don’t want Biden. We want Beto. We want Bernie,” said Ms. Jones, a junior. “I think we can convince them.”  The difference in opinion across generations speaks to the changing politics of black communities, said Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, the racial justice organization.  And the  historically diverse Democratic field  has given voters plentiful options to choose from: multiple black candidates, white progressives  who openly back once-radical ideas like reparations , and Mr. Biden, who served as vice president to the first black president.  Black voters are overwhelmingly members of the Democratic Party, and polls show they have long regarded Mr. Trump as a racist president and individual whom they are desperate to replace. A  recent national poll  of Democratic primary voters from NBC and The Wall Street Journal showed Mr. Biden had the support of nearly 50 percent with black respondents, though others have shown a less commanding lead. “Black people are strategic voters, particularly older black people,” Mr. Robinson said. “They’re thinking harm reduction. They’re doing a deep analysis about what they think white people will accept and won’t accept.” He pointed to the last Democratic primary, when younger black voters tracked more toward Mr. Sanders than their older counterparts, who overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton. In 2008, younger black voters supported Barack Obama in much bigger numbers than the electorate at large, until his victory in the Iowa Caucus led to a surge of support.  “Young people are constantly signaling what’s next and what’s possible,” Mr. Robinson said. “And while there’s some love for Biden, but sometimes you’re in a relationship because you’re comfortable and it’s what you know.”  Another Texas Southern student, Christopher Anwuri, 22, said the generational differences in how black voters saw the primary were fueled by opposing theories of political change: incrementalism versus immediate upheaval.  “This generation is looking for an instant, quick fix for problems,” he said. Older black people, meanwhile, think “these things need to take time.”  It also comes back to Mr. Obama, and  the long shadow he casts over national Democratic politics , particularly in black communities. Older black voters invoke his name in deference, and cite his embrace of  Mr. Biden  as something that helped him win the trust of skeptical white voters in 2008.  To younger generations, many of whom were in high school or younger at the time, Mr. Obama’s achievements exist on their own. Their first memories of Mr. Biden stem from his highly meme-able vice-presidential years. They are also more likely to hold his long and at times controversial record — on  criminal justice ,  school segregation  and the  Clarence Thomas hearings , among other things — against him.  Jayla Lee, 19, said older black voters “like Biden because he was with Obama, and they feel like since they could trust Obama that means they can trust him.”  “But the things we endure are not the things they endured,” Ms. Lee said. “And I’m looking for someone who can change the things that affect me.”  Darren Black, 22, said older generations were always “going to ride” for Mr. Biden, because “Joe was there with Obama.”  “But the younger generation, we've seen mass shootings, we’re seeing more police brutality — we’re looking at different things,” Mr. Black said.  Yet contrary to their stereotype as idealistic and apathetic, and with the steely pessimism of seasoned political operatives, younger voters expressed a cleareyed understanding that their efforts to lobby their relatives would not necessarily be successful.  Asked if she’d had any luck converting her family to more progressive candidates, Ms. Williams, a political science major, said, “I’m making no progress. None. Not even a tiny bit. I wish.” Ms. Williams called her pro-Biden father a lost cause. “We’re both opinionated and headstrong people, a nd I just don’t have the energy to go back and forth,” she said.  Mr. Smith, a member of the school’s College Democrats, said he liked Mr. Biden, but preferred his more left-wing rivals, such as Mr. O’Rourke, Mr. Castro, Ms. Harris or Ms. Warren.  After the debate, he thought about further pestering his grandmother over her support for Mr. Biden, but he reconsidered out of fear of coming off as pushy.  “You know, it’s grandma, so you got to let her have it,” Mr. Smith said.  When reached by phone, however, Mr. Smith’s grandmother, Alice Varnado, said his previous lobbying efforts had been more successful than he may have realized.  Ms. Varnado, 69, said she still preferred Mr. Biden, but that she had grown concerned about his age in recent months. She said she would vote for whichever Democrat earned the nomination, but she now considers Ms. Warren her second choice.  Her family members — Mr. Smith and his uncle — had convinced her. “You know, since talking with my grandson and my son, I think I can go with her,” said Ms. Varnado. “I’m starting to like her. There’s been a turning point.”  Katie Glueck contributed reporting."
"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines for Sept. 20 are here. Check out what's clicking today in entertainment. Rosario Dawson  penned an op-ed in which she said the current U.S. immigration policies feed into “a larger white nationalist narrative.” The 40-year-old actress, who is dating  2020 presidential  hopeful Sen.  Cory Booker , shared her thoughts in an article for The Daily Beast in which she pulled no punches speaking about the  Trump administration's  rhetoric on immigration, directly linking it to the  Aug. 3 shooting in Texas . “The story that the current administration repeats ad nauseam is about a “violent invasion” of immigrant hordes — the exact same words used by the gunman who targeted our Latino community and shot down 22 innocent people in El Paso last month,”  she wrote . “This last week’s denial of refugees from the Bahamas fleeing the destruction of Hurricane Dorian because they could be “very bad gang members” saw thousands of climate refugees abandoned to squalid conditions.” ROSARIO DAWSON POSTS TOPLESS VIDEO TO MARK 40TH BIRTHDAY The star highlighted the importance of telling positive stories about immigrants in the U.S. as well as the consequences of misrepresenting them.

They operate as part of a larger white nationalist narrative, a continuation of manifest destiny-thinking remixed for the age of Twitter,” she wrote. WHY ROSARIO DAWSON REPORTEDLY DIDN'T ATTEND BOYFRIEND CORY BOOKER'S DEBATE NIGHT Dawson continued: “The truth is, this thinking is symptomatic of an old and still very much alive colonial disease. If we want to heal this country’s deep scars on these issues, we need to look at the root causes and treat them at the source. When it comes to immigration, this is more than just a political crisis—we’re suffering a crisis of our very humanity. And one way to change the debate in Washington is by changing the stories we produce and consume in our own lives.” Dawson pointed to a new web series that she helped make and co-stars in titled “The North Pole” as an example of something telling worthwhile stories about immigrants. The series is set in Oakland, Calif., and follows four young people as they deal with issues such as immigration struggles, wildfires, racial tensions and much more. The actress, who fans may know from roles in films like “Rent,” “Men in Black II” and “He’s Got Game,” is also known for her political activism. She backed  Sen.

"Top conservative blogger Matt Drudge says the Democratic presidential nomination is Elizabeth Warren's to lose; reaction on 'The Five.' A Wall Street executive made a gloomy prediction on Thursday about a potential  Elizabeth Warren  presidency, suggesting that the stock market ""won't open"" if she was sworn into office. Omega Advisors CEO Leon Cooperman appeared on CNBC to express his concerns and shared his predictions on what would happen if the Massachusetts senator was elected. ""There’s unquestionably a shift to the left in this country. They won’t open the stock market if Elizabeth Warren is the next president,"" Cooperman claimed. He later explained his rationale; “When I said they wouldn’t open the market if Elizabeth Warren won, my way of just saying the market would be very vulnerable.” WARREN GETS STUMPED BY COLBERT WHEN PRESSED ON MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES TO FUND MEDICARE-FOR-ALL When asked what will happen to the stock market if Warren clinches the Democratic nomination, Cooperman predicted that the market will be ""lower"" if she or her progressive colleague, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, becomes a ""credible opponent"" to President Trump, citing a potential ""25 percent"" dip in the market. ""Her policies are counterproductive, they're negative for capitalism, and the capitalism is what brought America to the position that we're in today,"" Cooperman added.

"But in a back-and-forth with reporters, he did not deny discussing former Vice President Joe Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call -- a potential subject for the complaint.  And he admitted he did not know the whistleblower's identity, despite his accusation of partisanship. It was a robust self-defense against accusations that remain, for now, veiled in mystery. An intelligence watchdog has said the claims are ""urgent"" and ""serious,"" but the acting top intelligence official has declined to provide them to Congress. Trump dismissed them as another attempt to bring down his presidency. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump called the story ""ridiculous"" and described the whistleblower as ""just another political hack job.""  ""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" Trump said alongside his Australian counterpart, who he was hosting for a state visit. Asked whether he'd discussed Biden with Ukraine's Zelensky during a phone call in late July, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed,"" but insisted that someone should look into Biden. ""It was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor's taken off the case,"" Trump said, appearing to refer to January remarks when Biden discussed his interactions with Ukraine's leadership when serving as vice president. ""The fake news,"" Trump claimed,""doesn't look into things like that."" Trump's remarks came a day after the New York Times and Washington Post reported that an intelligence whistleblower had submitted a complaint related to Trump's interactions on Ukraine. Precise details of the accusation aren't known, much to the chagrin of Democratic lawmakers, who have demanded more information. Trump admitted Friday he did not know the whistleblower's identity, and said he wasn't even sure if it was his conversation with Ukraine's leader that was the topic of the complaint. But he nevertheless appeared defensive about his interactions with Zelensky, whom he will meet next week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Appearing in a rambling interview on CNN on Thursday evening, the President's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani admitted he himself had discussed Biden with Ukraine's leaders during a visit to the country. That conversation has come under scrutiny from House investigators, who have demanded more information about Trump and Giuliani's interactions regarding Ukraine and the Biden matter. That includes a transcript of Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president. Democrats are also looking for more information about the whistleblower's complaint. ""There's a real sense of urgency here since the Inspector General was so clear this is not something that can wait,"" said House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff on Friday, a day after his panel was briefed behind closed doors by the inspector general."

"Fox Nation host  Tomi Lahren  blasted the latest controversial proposal from 2020  Democratic  presidential candidate Bernie  Sanders , I-Vt., to spend a whopping $2.5 trillion to guarantee housing for every American. “Guaranteed housing, add that to the list of socialist agenda items that sound good to some, but in reality, are just big government solutions that move our nation away from freedom and closer to  socialism ,” said Lahren on  Fox Nation’s  “Final Thoughts.” TRUMP SAYS CALIFORNIA CITIES 'DESTROY THEMSELVES' WITH HOMELESSNESS On Wednesday, Sanders unveiled his “Housing for All” plan. The progressive senator said there’s a shortage of 7.4 million affordable homes for the lowest-income renters. And he stressed that more than 18 million families across the country are paying more than half of their limited incomes on housing and utilities. A spokesman for President Trump's reelection  campaign  called it ""yet another pie-in-the-sky, big government socialist promise by the Bernie camp."" Lahren panned the plan as “another giant, expensive federal program” and blasted Sanders’ plan to pay for it all. “How does he plan to pay for it? The way all these Democrats plan to pay for their radical proposals, taxation.  Bernie claims a wealth tax on the top 1/10 of 1 percent of Americans will fund his initiative.” She continued, “Well, folks, he and others in his party already plan to dump the burden of Medicare-for-all, free college, medical debt cancellation, and the Green New Deal on the backs of the wealthy. Do they really think the top 1 percent can afford to fund the entire nation? Total income confiscation wouldn’t pay for all those programs!” Lahren argued that increasing taxes on the wealthy encourages them to move, leaving the middle class to foot the bill. “Here’s the thing about wealth, Bernie, it’s MOBILE. Meaning the wealthiest Americans are not going to sit idly by as their incomes are confiscated to fund your big government pie-in-the-sky plans,” Lahren said. She continued, “Then what? What happens when the richest Americans take their money elsewhere? Who pays for these quasi-socialist plans? Answer, we do. The middle class, the average American.” The concern that the wealthy may move to avoid paying taxes is not a hypothetical, according to Lahren. She said that is exactly what has happened in her state. “That’s why the middle class has been driven out of places like California, for cryin’ out loud. It’s only affordable for the exorbitantly wealthy and the homeless!” LAHREN ON AMERICAN UNITY AFTER 9/11: 'WE HAVE JUST LOST IT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY' Finally, Lahren said that Sanders’ proposal would not decrease homelessness. “I live in California, the state that is comprised of 47 percent of all unsheltered people in the nation. Yet what do we do here in California? We add more taxes, more regulations, more control on top of already cash-strapped residents and families. Here’s what else I know, throwing more government and more taxpayer dollars at the problem does not solve the problem. If it did we wouldn’t be in this predicament right here in California.” Lahren concluded, “When will these socialist wannabes figure it out?  Throwing taxpayer dollars, big government and entitlement at the problem does not solve the problem. It just moves our nation one dangerous step closer to socialism. Maybe that’s what people like Bernie want but it’s up to us to stand in his way.” To see Lahren's full remarks and for more episodes of Tomi Lahren's daily commentary offering a refreshing and unfiltered perspective on issues across the country, join  Fox Nation  and watch  ""First & Final Thoughts""   today.

"The president defends his conversations with world leaders and blasts Joe Biden's 'disgraceful' statement on Ukraine during an Oval Office meeting with Australian PM Scott Morrison. The developing controversy over a mysterious phone conversation  President Trump  had with a foreign leader apparently centers on Ukraine, as the president and his allies fight back and claim the uproar is just another ""partisan"" plot against him. What touched off the  controversy is a secret  whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM   Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, seemed to acknowledge some effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate potential corruption related to the Biden family, though he gave conflicting answers on the matter in a CNN interview overnight. It remains unclear what the supposed ""promise"" from Trump entailed. The president, however, maintained he said nothing improper, tearing into those pushing the allegations Friday. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, alongside visiting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the president blasted the “ridiculous” story, blaming a “partisan whistleblower” and calling it “just another political hack job.” “I don’t know the identity of the whistleblower,” Trump said. He wouldn’t say what was discussed in the call but said someone should “look into” Biden family connections to Ukraine. He also argued the press has had “a bad week,” insisting he has prevailed in controversies reported by the media. “I guess I’m about 22 and 0, and I’ll keep it that way,” the president said. Afterward, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democratic committee leaders issued a statement demanding the administration hand over the complaint. “President Trump just went on national television—from the Oval Office—and personally attacked an Intelligence Community whistleblower who reported an urgent matter involving serious or flagrant misconduct,"" they said, adding that the ""brazen effort to intimidate this whistleblower risks a chilling effect on future whistleblowers."" Earlier Friday, Trump sounded off on Twitter, accusing Schiff of joining with the media to go after him once again. “The Radical Left Democrats and their Fake News Media partners, headed up again by Little Adam Schiff, and batting Zero for 21 against me, are at it again!” the president tweeted Friday. “They think I may have had a ‘dicey’ conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a ‘highly partisan’ whistleblowers statement.” He added: “Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!” For his part, Schiff told reporters Friday that the whistleblower claim ""deserves a thorough investigation."" ""Come hell or high water that’s what we’re going to do,” he said. Meanwhile, allies of the president took to the airwaves to downplay the story ""This is a clear example of someone from the deep state ... from the intelligence community,"" former  Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said on Fox News’  ""The Story with Martha MacCallum."" ""It was completely overblown. ... It will be a big nothing burger."" Fueling intrigue, Giuliani has raised questions about the activities of former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into that company. During an interview Thursday on CNN, Giuliani was asked whether he had asked Ukraine to look into Biden. Giuliani initially said, ""No, actually I didn't,"" but seconds later he said, ""Of course I did."" He explained that he sought for the government to look into how the case was dismissed. Later, Giuliani tweeted, ""A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job."" MATTHEW WHITAKER CALLS REPORTED WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT A 'CLEAR EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE FROM THE DEEP STATE' The whistleblower complaint has triggered a major showdown with Congress, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would not share details of it with lawmakers. The inspector general for the intelligence community received the complaint and, according to correspondence with Schiff, considered the allegations “credible” and dealing with an “urgent concern.” But the watchdog reported to the committee that his office is “at an impasse” with the director of national intelligence over the disclosure. Inspector General Michael Atkinson wrote that the DNI, “after consulting with the Department of Justice,” determined the complaint does not have to be shared with the intelligence committees under law. He wrote that he will “abide by that determination,” but disagrees with it. After a closed-door hearing Thursday with Atkinson, Schiff voiced concerns about not having access to the information, warning Congress could use legal action or budgetary powers as leverage. ""What’s at stake here goes well beyond this complaint and this president,"" he said. Schiff had subpoenaed Maguire saying he was withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioning whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a letter Tuesday, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of ""urgent concern."" He said the complaint ""concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision."" Schiff said last week that Maguire is required to share the complaint with Congress and said the attempt to hold it back ""raises serious concerns about whether White House, Department of Justice or other executive branch officials are trying to prevent a legitimate whistleblower complaint from reaching its intended recipient, the Congress, in order to cover up serious misconduct."" Following Thursday’s Atkinson hearing, Maguire is still expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. Fox News’ Judson Berger and Hillary Vaughn and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"That call, which took place on July 25, one day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was also part of  a whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, the source added, a revelation that is likely to raise more questions in the ongoing controversy.  The Wall Street Journal  was first to report that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the July phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son Hunter, citing multiple people familiar with the matter.  The Journal also reported that Trump told Zelensky ""that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know"" whether allegations were true or not, one of the people said, according to the Journal.  Trump did not discuss a pending aid package to the country in the July 25 call, indicating that there may not have been an explicit quid pro quo outlined by the President in the conversation, the source familiar with the issue told CNN.  A readout of the call put out by the Ukrainian government says, ""Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA."" Joe Biden responded to the new revelations in a strongly-worded statement Friday.  ""If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump's willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation—a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia—pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor,"" Biden said.  ""Such clear-cut corruption damages and diminishes our institutions of government by making them tools of a personal political vendetta. At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress,"" he added. Trump downplays whistleblower's claims  Before the Journal's report was published, Trump downplayed the significance of the whistleblower complaint at the center of the latest controversy consuming Washington. During remarks in the Oval Office Friday, Trump claimed the whistleblower is partisan and his conversations with foreign leaders are ""appropriate."" But in a back-and-forth with reporters, Trump did not deny discussing Biden with Zelensky in that July phone call -- a potential subject for the complaint. ""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" Trump said prior to the Journal's report being published while appearing alongside the Australian Prime Minister, who he was hosting for a state visit. Precise details of the accusation aren't known, much to the chagrin of Democratic lawmakers, who have demanded more information. ""To ask a foreign leader to interfere in a presidential election - right after a year long investigation into potential foreign interference in a presidential election - would be pretty extraordinary. Even for these times,"" Connecticut Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy tweeted Friday in reaction to the news.   Trump admitted Friday he did not know the whistleblower's identity, and said he wasn't even sure if it was his conversation with Ukraine's leader that was the topic of the complaint. But he nevertheless appeared defensive about his interactions with Zelensky, with whom he will meet next week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Trump still pushing Biden claim Asked whether he'd discussed Biden with Ukraine's Zelensky during a phone call in late July, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed,"" but insisted that someone should look into Biden. ""It was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor's taken off the case,"" Trump said, appearing to refer to January remarks when Biden discussed his interactions with Ukraine's leadership when serving as vice president. Appearing  in a rambling interview on CNN on Thursday evening , Giuliani admitted he had discussed Biden with Ukraine's leaders during a visit to the country. Giuliani has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden's call in 2016 to remove the country's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company connected to Biden's son, Hunter. Other Western governments also called for that prosecutor's dismissal, and no evidence has indicated Biden's move was inappropriate. Ukraine's prosecutor general told Bloomberg in May he had no proof of wrongdoing by Biden or his son. Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian President has come under scrutiny from House investigators and they have demanded more information about Trump and Giuliani's interactions regarding Ukraine and the Biden matter, including calls for a transcript of Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president. Democrats are also looking for more information about the whistleblower's complaint. ""There's a real sense of urgency here since the Inspector General was so clear this is not something that can wait,"" said House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff on Friday, a day after his panel was briefed behind closed doors by the inspector general."
"The Wall Street Journal reports that in a July phone call, President Trump repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son. President Trump  faced fresh calls for impeachment on Friday after a new report claimed Trump asked the president of Ukraine numerous times in a single phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. Biden said on Friday that the claim has no credibility. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary  Julian Castro , a  2020 candidate , responded to the report by calling Trump a ""criminal"" who need to be impeached ""immediately."" WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., renewed his impeachment calls on Friday, accusing Trump of ""moral vandalism."" ""This story is stunning and should be shaking Washington right now -- Donald Trump's moral vandalism disqualifies him from being president. As I've said before, it's time for impeachment proceedings,"" he tweeted. Fellow 2020 contender  Beto O'Rouke  had already called for impeachment in reaction to statements made by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's attorney, on Thursday night. ""When will Congress have the courage to act?"" he asked in an apparent dig at leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. DEMOCRATS AREN'T ACTUALLY IMPEACHING THE PRESIDENT-- YET, BUT THEY ARE DIGGING DEEP Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, claimed the House had ""no choice"" but to impeach after the Journal's report surfaced. ""Everything Nixon did during Watergate pales in comparison to Trump using the power of the Presidency to pressure a foreign leader who needs U.S. Aid to investigate a political opponent,"" Pfeiffer said. The whistleblower controversy seemed to raise even more concerns among the 2020 field, many of whom already called for the president's impeachment. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , called on Friday for the whistleblower to come forward, offering protection as he defied the administration. She also suggested that Trump was trying to interfere in the 2020 election like, according to her, he did in 2016. ""He has openly invited interference and now we have information that suggests that again, he is engaged in that kind of behavior,"" she said at a campaign stop. ""What he fails to understand is that he is the President of the United States and that office ... is the people's office -- not his office,"" she added. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., didn't directly address the report on Twitter but did dispute Trump's attorneys' claims that he couldn't be criminally prosecuted. ""Yes, he can,"" she tweeted on Friday after the Journal's report surfaced. Trump, for his part, has denied any wrongdoing. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The Radical Left Democrats and their Fake News Media partners, headed up again by Little Adam Schiff, and batting Zero for 21 against me, are at it again!"" he tweeted, referring to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. ""They think I may have had a 'dicey' conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a 'highly partisan' whistleblowers ... statement."" ""Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!"" he added."
"McAleenan called white supremacist extremism is one of the most ""potent ideologies"" driving acts violence in the US.  ""In our modern age, the continued menace of racially based violent extremism, particularly white supremacist extremism, is an abhorrent affront to the nation, the struggle and unity of its diverse population,"" he said in a speech at the Brookings Institution. He pointed to the attacks in  Poway ,  El Paso ,  Pittsburgh  and  Charleston , saying they were motivated by various extremist ideologies, including ""very concerningly and increasingly, white supremacist violent extremism."" According to McAleenan, ISIS and al Qaeda remain the ""two most pressing radical Islamist terrorist threats"" to the US with potential to direct plots and also to inspire homegrown violent extremism in their name.  The strategic announcement  comes just days after a judge ruled  that the American Airlines mechanic accused of trying to sabotage a commercial airliner before takeoff will be held in custody until trial. The judge said during a bond hearing that Ahmed Alani, who allegedly tried to damage or disable an aircraft's air data module system, ""may be very sympathetic to terrorists.""  Alani has been charged with ""willfully damaging, destroying, disabling, or wrecking an aircraft, and attempting to do so,"" according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court earlier this month. No terror-related charges have been filed. President Donald Trump has been criticized for not condemning white supremacy strongly enough, with some accusing him of exacerbating the problem.  Earlier this month, former Vice President Joe Biden connected Trump's rhetoric with the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, saying in a speech that the President has ""fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation."" In August,  CNN reported that White House officials rebuffed efforts  by their colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a year to make combating domestic terror threats, such as those from white supremacists, a greater priority as specifically spelled out in the National Counterterrorism Strategy, sources told CNN. Last October, the  White House unveiled its national counterterrorism strategy , which offered a broad strokes blueprint for how the Trump administration will and already has approached the threat of terrorism, from targeting terrorists at their source to beefing up efforts domestically to tackle the threat of homegrown terrorism.  Recently-ousted national security adviser John Bolton described the new strategy at the time as a sharp departure from President Barack Obama's approach to confronting terrorism, emphasizing the Trump administration's recognition of the threat as one rooted in radical Islamist ideology. ""Radical Islamist terrorist groups still represent the preeminent threat to the United States,"" Bolton said. ""We recognize that there is a terrorist ideology that we're confronting. And I think it's long been the President's view that without recognizing that we're in an ideological struggle, that we can't properly address the terrorist threat."""

"'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on why President Trump's handling of the latest showdown with Iran is drawing increased media criticism, especially from the likes of John Bolton and neocons. John Bolton had to know he was sending a message to the man who pushed him out of the White House. And a strong message it was, disagreeing with the president on just about every foreign policy hot spot. The recently departed national security adviser was speaking to a Manhattan luncheon for the Gatestone Institute, a conservative think tank he once chaired. About 60 people were gathered at Le Bernadin, including such hotshots as Alan Dershowitz, former attorney general Michael Mukasey and Newsmax chief Chris Ruddy. So the leak, in this case to Politico, was inevitable. The former Fox News contributor certainly gets that any words uttered before such a large audience will soon find their way into print. SIZE MATTERS? MEDIA PRAISE ELIZABETH WARREN -- AND HER CROWDS What’s fascinating here is that the Bolton broadside comes as Trump’s handling of the latest showdown with Iran is drawing increasing media criticism, especially from the right. The president is essentially in a no-win situation, whether he chooses a military strike against Iran or sticks with diplomacy and sanctions. The neocon wing of the GOP wants him to retaliate for the attack on Saudi oil facilities that our intel agencies are blaming on Iran, and is casting his reluctance as a sign of weakness. Bolton told the luncheon that any negotiations were Iran (and North Korea) are “doomed to failure,”  according to Politico. “Bolton also said more than once that Trump’s failure to respond to the Iranian attack on an American drone earlier this summer set the stage for the Islamic Republic’s aggression in recent months…Bolton said the planned response had gone through the full process and everybody in the White House had agreed on the retaliatory strike. But ‘a high authority, at the very last minute,’ without telling anyone, decided not to do it.” Reporters quickly asked Trump for his response. “John was not able to work with anybody, and a lot of people disagreed with his ideas,” he said. “A lot of people were very critical that I brought him on in the first place because of the fact that he was so in favor of going into the Middle East, and he got stuck in quicksand and we became policemen for the Middle East. It’s ridiculous.” SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES The president was referring to the Iraq war and Bolton’s role in the Bush administration. Trump ran against that war, and endless wars, and obviously wants to get out of Afghanistan. The neocons are growing more critical of Trump’s reluctance to pull the trigger in these situations. He even got into a little spat with his pal Lindsey Graham, who said, like Bolton, that the president’s failure to strike back after Iran downed an American drone is what paved the way for the attack that cut Saudi oil production in half. The Beltway press, as part of an establishment whose kids are rarely sent off to fight, often reflects these pro-war instincts. Iraq, you’ll recall, was going to be a cakewalk. Bret Stephens, a conservative  New York Times  columnist who detests the president, wrote yesterday that Trump’s policy is “locked, half-cocked, and probably bluffing.” He said this president combines “the rhetorical impulses of Bob Dornan with the strategic instincts of Dennis Kucinich.” Trump does like to talk tough with foreign adversaries. And obviously he has ordered airstrikes before. But it’s no accident that he threatened to incinerate North Korea and wound up in a pen pal relationship with Kim Jong-un. And yet if he keeps turning to sanctions and diplomacy, does there come a point where he looks like Barack Obama and his Syrian red line? Trump is bound to disappoint the neocons by exercising restraint when it comes to military options, knowing full well that there are unintended consequences that could bog down U.S. troops for years to come. That means he’s likely to face continued criticism from John Bolton, but might be in tune with the war-weary portion of the country."

"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders sits down with Bret Baier following the debate. For the third straight time, the  Democratic  presidential debate in Houston led with a discussion of health care. As Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., put it: ""Every one of my colleagues on this stage believes in universal health care."" Booker’s statement prompts this question: Why should government get involved in health care for Americans who do not require government assistance? Most Americans believe the  government  should provide a ""safety net"" for the poor. It does this with assistance such as food stamps. However, you do not hear anyone calling for an expansion of food stamps to cover all Americans regardless of whether they are rich or poor. So why is that the case with health care? HOW MUCH WOULD 'MEDICARE FOR ALL' COST? DEMOCRATS' HEALTH CARE PLAN EXPLAINED The federal government, through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – more commonly known as food stamps – provides  assistance  to low-income people. The government does not make the food or control the price of food. It does not dictate what foods people should buy. And the government provides absolutely no food assistance to the majority of American households. This is a ""safety net."" It is designed to make sure the poorest among us have food on their table. There seems to be broad agreement that food stamps are a good way to address the nutritional needs of our poor. In health care, we have something similar. It is called Medicaid. It provides funding for medical services for low-income and disabled people. We also have Medicare, which provides health insurance coverage for older Americans. So the government already has programs in place to take care of the health of our poor and elderly. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Until President Obama came along, there seemed to be rough consensus that this was the right way to ensure America took care of its poor and elderly. Most Americans were, presumably, in a position to take care of their own health care. Most accomplished this by working in job that provided health benefits, buying their own insurance, or relying on a parent or spouse's health insurance plan. Others chose not to buy insurance and to pay for care as they received it. Obama and his fellow Democrats insisted that every American have government health care or private insurance, and thus devised ObamaCare, which expanded Medicaid to cover more Americans. In order to cover everyone else, for the first time in our nation’s history the federal government made it illegal not to purchase a particular product: in this case, health insurance. Yes, even if you paid tens of thousands of dollars for your child to become a doctor who could take care of you for free, you still were legally obligated to buy health insurance. Now health care is again front and center for Democrats. They say ObamaCare is not enough. They insist America must provide free health care for every single American, old and young, rich and poor. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., criticized former Vice President Joe Biden’s plan in the last debate because it only covered 97 percent of Americans! For his part, Biden proudly announced that under his plan the government will tell drug companies what they can charge for drugs. With government now involved in everyone’s health care, we are seeing the adverse effects. Everyone is now on government health care or mandatory insurance, and insurance premiums cost the same regardless of a person’s heath, destroying much of the free market in health care. Where are the menus of services with prices at the doctor’s office? They are not there because people do not care what the cost is because they don’t pay it! The government and insurance companies are in the middle, determining what and how much to pay, but never sure about what services the doctor or hospital actually provided. Fraud, therefore, runs rampant. Patients have no incentive to shop for better pricing, and doctors have no incentive to provide it. Patients similarly have no financial incentive to avoid doctor visits by maintaining a proper diet and exercise. As a result, we have runaway increases in the costs of health care. The Democratic solution? For Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others on the stage, it is to put the final bullet in what is left of the free market in health care. Progressivism has taken over the Democratic Party. It no longer believes in free markets. History shows that if government would get out of the way and allow the free market to do its thing, there is no telling what solutions would emerge for health care. New technologies utilizing the Internet, cell phones, Skype, and artificial intelligence would be fully exploited. Competition would bring down prices, as we have seen in areas of medical care not covered by the government or insurance companies. Sanders complains that America is ""the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people."" America also is the richest country on Earth. Has he ever considered that the two may be related? It is precisely because America does not hand over control of large sectors of its economy to the government that we have had such economic success. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Why is a safety net insufficient for Democrats? Is it about control? Is it about destroying free-market capitalism wherever they can? Is it in pursuit of a liberal utopia where everyone is treated the same? We do not know. The question was never asked.

"John Yoo and Buck Sexton react. President Trump  nominated a slew of judges Friday to posts on California-based federal courts, ramping up efforts to reshape the judiciary after hitting a milestone earlier this month with the confirmation of the 150th federal judge on his watch. Two nominations are for the influential San Francisco-based  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , a long-liberal bench with jurisdiction across the American West whose political makeup has shifted with Trump’s aggressive appointment campaign. TRUMP TAKES ON CALIFORNIA OVER FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS Among the nominees is Patrick Bumatay, a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of California whom Trump nominated last year for the same job. But objections from California Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, over his lack of judicial experience and other issues, derailed the nomination. Trump later nominated Bumatay, who is openly gay, to a district court seat but his name resurfaced over the summer for a possible comeback bid for the Ninth Circuit amid a new vacancy.  While it is traditional for a nominee's home-state senators to give their approval, it is not required, and Trump lately has  bypassed the so-called “blue slip” tradition  in order to get conservative judges on the bench. While Democrats have fumed at the tactics, conservatives cheered Trump this month for seeing the 150th federal judge confirmed. “This is a historic milestone,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a statement. “As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will continue to push through highly qualified, conservative judges at all levels of the federal courts.” Graham and his Republican allies on the committee are likely to be receptive to Trump’s latest picks. Trump also nominated Lawrence VanDyke, a Justice Department official and former Nevada solicitor general, for the Ninth Circuit. Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, praised his record fighting “the overreach by the Obama Administration and its job-killing EPA.” Trump on Friday announced four other nominees for California District Court posts. But the Ninth Circuit has been a focal point given the sprawling territory it covers and its record in decades past of liberal-leaning rulings. Under Trump, the court has shifted more moderate with the addition of seven Trump-appointed judges. Nearly half of the 29 seats are now occupied by GOP-appointed judges. Last year, that number stood at six. NINTH CIRCUIT HANDS TRUMP WIN ON ASYLUM POLICY Earlier this month, the court handed Trump a win as it lifted a nationwide injunction on his controversial asylum policy, ruling that for now the injunction should only apply to states within the circuit. Trump also scored a victory from a California district court on Thursday when a Bush-appointed judge granted a request to block, for now, a law requiring presidential candidates to release tax returns in order to run in the state primaries. Democrats, though, have accused the Trump administration, along with GOP allies in the Senate, of destroying congressional custom by moving past consultations with home-state senators. Feinstein, in a floor speech over the summer about another Ninth Circuit nomination, said, “This disregard of blue slips represents another breakdown of Senate traditions.” She said screening candidates for lifetime appointments to ensure they’re qualified is a “critical” task and warned Republicans: “What goes round, comes around.” The latest nominations also come amid new legal battles between the Trump administration and California. Early Friday afternoon, 23 states banded together to sue the administration in a bid to stop its plan to revoke California’s authority to set strict fuel economy standards. That suit was filed in a D.C. federal court and does not fall in the Ninth Court, but California Attorney General Xavier Becerra touted prior rulings in his state that upheld California’s standards. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Two courts have already upheld California’s emissions standards, rejecting the argument the Trump Administration resurrects to justify its misguided Preemption Rule. Yet, the Administration insists on attacking the authority of California and other states to tackle air pollution and protect public health,” he said in a statement.  Fox News’ Gregg Re and Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report."
"Klopfer died on September 3 and his family  was going through his belongings at his home  in Will County, about 45 miles from Chicago, when they found the medically preserved remains, authorities said. They were inside small, sealed plastic bags that contained a chemical used to preserve biological material, Will County Sheriff Mike Kelley told reporters at a news conference Thursday. They were in boxes that were mixed in with other storage boxes  ""I can tell you, the 31 years I've been doing this job, I have never seen anything like this, ever. It is a strange, one of those once-in-a-lifetime things,"" he said.  Klopfer operated three abortion clinics in South Bend, Indiana, before his license was suspended in 2015. County officials estimated how long the remains had been preserved but did not provide details on how they determined they were from nearly two decades ago. ""The condition they are in, it is clear that they are older,"" said James Glasgow, Will County state's attorney.  Klopfer did not follow Indiana law for disposal of the fetal remains and the filing of the proper paperwork, Glasgow said. The remains will be transferred to the custody of the Indiana attorney general.  An attorney representing the doctor's family called the Will County coroner's office on September 12 to inform them the family had discovered what appeared to be the remains of fetuses and asked for assistance in removing them, the Will County Sheriff's Office said. Detectives arrived at the address and the coroner's office took the remains. The family is cooperating with the investigation.  There is no evidence any medical procedures were conducted at the doctor's property, according to the sheriff's office.  Anti-abortion groups have gathered at the site of his former clinics to demand the identification and burial of the remains,  CNN affiliate WNDU reported.  One woman  told WNDU  that she was raped as a minor and had an abortion at one of Klopfer's clinics. ""For me, closure would be just know if my baby was on his property so that I can just have a proper burial,"" Serena Dyksen said.  South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, called for an investigation. ""Like everyone, I find the news out of Illinois extremely disturbing, and I think it's important that it be fully investigated,"" Buttigieg  said Wednesday . ""I also hope it doesn't get caught up in politics at a time when women need access to health care. There's no question that what happened is disturbing. It's unacceptable. And it needs to be looked into fully."""

"Here's what else you need to know to  Get Up to Speed and Out the Door . (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily.  Sign up here .) 1. Whistleblower scandal OK, this story is really complicated, so let's just start at the beginning. A whistleblower inside the intelligence community filed a complaint about communications between President Trump and a foreign leader. The whistleblower was alarmed by a ""promise"" Trump allegedly made to the foreign leader. The Democratically led House Intelligence Committee wants to see the complaint, but Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence, has blocked that. (He's set to testify before the committee next week.) The White House and Justice Department told the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  not to share the complaint  because they don't believe it's governed by laws covering intelligence whistleblowers, three sources told CNN. Then, yesterday the  Washington Post  and  New York Times  reported that the communications at the center of all this involved Ukraine. Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by phone in July. Some Trump supporters have  pushed for the Ukrainian government to open investigations  that the President could use to raise suspicions about his political rivals, including Joe Biden. Some observers wonder if there's a connection between the push for an investigation and Trump's call with Zelensky. But there's no public evidence that the whistleblower's complaint pertains to the Trump-Zelensky call. The potential ramifications of this story are starting to become more clear, CNN political analyst Stephen Collinson says, and the  risks facing the President, the intelligence community and Democrats  in Congress are climbing by the day.  Here are 5 key questions  about the whistleblower case. 2. Justin Trudeau Another day, another apology from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. After a  third incident emerged  of him  wearing brownface or blackface , he was forced to meet with reporters for the second day in a row to say he's sorry for wearing racist makeup. He also flat out said he doesn't remember how many times he's worn blackface. Trudeau, known for his uber-progressive views, insists he's still an ally in the fight for social justice. But this scandal  and other recent political hiccups  could mix to seriously threaten his chances at re-election next month. 3. Israel It's been three days since votes were cast in Israel's elections, and we  still don't know who will be leading the country . Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White party, declared victory because his party is projected to win a few more seats in Israel's legislature than Likud, the political party headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But Gantz won't have enough seats to govern. He'd probably have to form a coalition with Netanyahu to do that, and that's probably not going to happen. So, that brings up another possibility: Israel may have to have a third election to settle the political gridlock. 4. Weather The remnants of Tropical Storm Imelda are  pushing into northern Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana  today, dumping heavy rain along the way. The storm left quite the mess in southeast Texas, where some areas got more than 30 inches of rain. Flooding was so bad in Houston that  hundreds of cars were abandoned  after rising water made some roads impassable. Meanwhile, out in the Atlantic,  Hurricane Jerry has developed . It's a Category 1 storm right now and is expected to pass just north of the Leeward Islands today before moving north of Puerto Rico and the Bahamas over the weekend. 5. Climate strike If your co-worker or classmate isn't around today, it may not be because they're getting an early jump on the weekend. They could be on strike. Global climate strikes are taking place today all over the world, with people walking out of workplaces and classrooms  to demand action to address the climate crisis .

"Giuliani's comments came in a heated exchange on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" as Chris Cuomo pressed the former New York mayor over conversations he'd had  with a Ukrainian official  about Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who had investigated the former vice president's son, Hunter. Giuliani has repeatedly pointed to the event as a scandal, even as other Western governments also called for that prosecutor's dismissal and no evidence has indicated Biden's move was inappropriate. That prosecutor was replaced by Yuriy Lutsenko, who would later drop an investigation into a company in which Hunter Biden was involved. ""Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?"" Cuomo asked Giuliani. ""No, actually I didn't. I asked the Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016 by the Ukrainians for the benefit of Hillary Clinton, for which there is already a court finding,"" Giuliani responded.  ""You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden and his role with the prosecutor?"" Cuomo asked.  ""The only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that Lutsenko, who was appointed, dismissed the case,"" Giuliani said.  ""So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?"" Cuomo pressed. ""Of course I did,"" Giuliani said.  When asked about his contradicting answer, Giuliani said he ""didn't ask"" for Biden to be investigated specifically, but asked Ukraine ""to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme."" Giuliani's remarks come the same day  The Washington Post  and  The New York Times  reported that a recent whistleblower complaint about Trump making a ""promise"" to a foreign leader involves Ukraine.  As CNN previously reported , the complaint has led to a standoff between Congress and acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who has refused to turn over the complaint to the House Intelligence Committee."
"Fox Nation hosts Diamond &amp; Silk come to President Trump's defense on 'Fox &amp; Friends.' Fox Nation's   Diamond & Silk  weighed in on former NBA player  Charles Barkley  slamming  Democrats'  for their lack of action in the black community and accusing them of taking the black vote for granted. ""Let me just tell you this here, when it comes to Democrats listening, they promise on everything and they deliver on nothing,"" said Diamond on  ""Fox & Friends."" TRUMP TOUTS HISTORICALLY LOW LEVEL OF AFRICAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT Diamond also blasted some Democrats for pushing for reparations for African-Americans, which has recently become a talking point amongst 2020 Democrats. ""Look at how they're promising reparations, black people don't need reparations, they need liberation from the Democrat party,"" Diamond said. The duo agreed largely with Barkley, who went after Democrats for allegedly only paying attention to black voters around election time. CHARLES BARKLEY JOKES ABOUT JUSSIE SMOLLETT, LIAM NEESON CONTROVERSIES DURING TNT'S NBA HALFTIME SHOW ""They’ve been taking black people’s votes – and they only talk to black people every four years. All of these politicians only talk to black people every four years because they want their vote,"" Barkley  said  in an interview aired Wednesday. He added that he thought Republicans didn't talk to black voters and that Democrats did ""nothing in the four years in between."" ""Fox & Friends"" host Brian Kilmeade agreed with Barkley, and called on Republicans to further their efforts in the black community, but Diamond and Silk pointed to President Trump's actions in response. ""When it comes to the Republican party, we have a Republican president. He's not all talk, he takes action,"" Diamond said, referencing the  historically low black unemployment rate  and Trump's commitment to the  First Step Act. ""So...Republicans don't have to pander, because they deliver...our Republican president...is delivering,"" she continued. Silk said she hoped black people would have a ""come to Jesus moment"" and that they would ""realize that the Democrat party mean black people no good."" Reiterating Diamond's support for Trump, Silk said the president is helping the black community by ""leading by example."" ""The president is doing what he needs to do when it comes down to black people by showing people this is what you need for the black community."" ""You need jobs so you can take care of your family,"" Silk continued, ""instead of talking about it, he's 'being about it,'  and that's why black people are waking up to it."" When co-host Steve Doocy observed that Barkley offered support for  Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg  as a  2020 candidate , Silk said she preferred to support the candidate that works towards the ""betterment of all Americans.""

"David Webb, Donna Brazile and A.B. Stoddard on whether not Joe Biden will win the African-American vote. Former Vice President Joe Biden will need to rely on ""older"" African-American voters if he hopes to win the White House in 2020, according to A.B. Stoddard. “This age divide in the African-American electorate is the crux of Joe Biden’s viability,” Stoddard told  “The Daily Briefing”  with Dana Perino. “If he loses older African-Americans along with his non-college white support, he won’t be the nominee,” she said. The comments came after The New York Times ran a column titled,  “Young Black Voters to Their Biden-Supporting Parents: ‘Is This Your King?”  The piece looked at views of younger black voters, which in many case differ from theirs of their older counterparts. FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN AT NEW LOW IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE Stoddard said that the reason older African-Americans support the former vice president is that “they are afraid” and want to beat  President Trump . “They believe that the Obama presidency led to a flare-up of racism in this country, and President Donald Trump. They want to beat him,” she said. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS Stoddard went on to say that older black voters believe the new direction of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party -- its vow to decriminalize border crossings, take away private insurance and stand up for other “radical positions” -- is “out of step with the country.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden  has been considered the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination since before he even entered the race. However, while he currently still leads the field, his support has been diminishing, according to a new Fox News Poll. Biden has the support of 29 percent of Democratic primary voters, according to the poll. That figure is down from 31 percent in August and 35 percent in May. His current 11-point lead is down from a high of 19 points in June."
"Despite major holes in The New York Times story, members of 'The Squad' are calling for Brett Kavanaugh's impeachment and other top Democrats are attacking the FBI's investigation into the allegations; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' The latest smear on Supreme Court Justice  Brett Kavanaugh  is a disaster for Democrats, and everyone seems to know it except the party's presidential candidates. No sooner had The New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, then most of the candidates demanded Kavanaugh's  impeachment . ""These newest revelations are disturbing,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter, adding ""Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."" RUSH LIMBAUGH: TREATMENT OF TRUMP BY DEMOCRATS, MEDIA HAS AMERICANS 'QUIETLY SEETHING' Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Kavanaugh's ""place on the court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached."" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Obama housing secretary Julián Castro and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke joined in with impeachment calls of their own. Even former Vice President Joe Biden demanded Congress open an investigation and ""follow the evidence to wherever it leads."" That was considered the restrained response in the Democratic field. Never mind that the supposed victim has told friends she has no recollection of the alleged incident; facts have never stood in the Democrats' way when it comes to Kavanaugh before. If the Democratic presidential contenders want to see  Kavanaugh  impeached, I say go for it. Open the investigation Biden has demanded. Start impeachment hearings. And broadcast it for all of America to see. Let's remind voters of the disgraceful confirmation process Kavanaugh faced. Let's relive how Democrats accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, exposing himself to a college classmate and participating in gang rapes at high school parties -- all without a shred of corroborating evidence. Let's rehash Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, but this time with the knowledge that the principal witness Ford named to her alleged assault, Leland Keyser, is now on record saying she does not believe Ford. Let's remind Americans how Senate Democrats denied Kavanaugh the presumption of innocence and insisted that the burden was on him to prove he was not a sexual predator. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER That sure worked out well for Democrats last time around. In 2018, the Kavanaugh debacle may have cost Democrats control of the Senate. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D.-Mo., lost their seats thanks to voters disgusted by their party's campaign of character assassination against Kavanaugh, while Democrats blew a chance to pick up GOP seats in Tennessee and Texas. As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at the time, the Kavanaugh hearings were ""like an adrenaline shot"" for the Republican base. Now, Democrats want to bring out the hypodermic needle for the 2020 elections. Sounds good to me. On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders know this a path to disaster. In a stunning rebuke of the party's presidential contenders, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told those calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment to ""get real."" ""We've got to get beyond this 'impeachment is the answer to every problem,'"" Durbin said. ""It's become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you're unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. ... If that's how we are identified ... we run the risk that people will feel we're ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was even more succinct. Asked if the House was going to investigate the new allegation, she said ""no."" Durbin and Pelosi understand that the threats to impeach Kavanaugh are a godsend for Trump. And they come in the wake of Senate Democrats issuing an unprecedented threat to the other Supreme Court justices. In a brief, they warned that if the high court does not rule as Democrats wish in a gun case, they could ""restructure"" the court when they take power in the 2020 elections -- packing it with liberal justices, flipping a 5-to-4 conservative majority to a liberal majority. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats do not seem to realize that when they make threats like these, they are not hurting Kavanaugh or Trump, they are hurting themselves. In 2016, 26 percent of Trump voters said Supreme Court nominees were the most important issue to them, while only 18 percent of Hillary Clinton's voters mirrored the sentiment. As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose. In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Kavanaugh or liberal court-packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should. So, let the impeachment proceedings begin. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MARC THIESSEN"

"The labor union's show of strength so far has amounted to nearly 50,000 autoworkers indefinitely on strike with the promise of being compensated only $250 per week. The strike comes at a great time for the scandal-ridden union. It offers the UAW the opportunity to restore its tarnished reputation with workers after several UAW officials were  implicated in a federal probe  last week concerning embezzled member dues. Expenses were reported for luxury items such as golf outings, expensive cigars and extended stays in private villas among other things,  according  to a federal criminal complaint. The union issued this  statement  in response to the probe: ""While these allegations are very concerning, we strongly believe that the government has misconstrued any number of facts and emphasize that these are merely allegations, not proof of wrongdoing."" It makes you question whose best interest the UAW has in mind. On Sunday they  rejected  a contract offer from GM that met several of the union's demands and could have avoided a strike altogether. Instead, both workers and the company will experience losses while the UAW tries to play hard ball. Surely, the UAW wants GM to experience some pain in order to demonstrate its value. But how long are they willing to wait it out when autoworkers' livelihoods are on the line, especially when a reasonable deal seems obtainable.  Under the proposed contract  submitted  on Sunday before the strike began, GM would have invested $7 billion in 8 facilities in four states, promising over 5,400 jobs. Additionally, workers would have gotten lump sum pay increases and an $8,000 signing bonus, among other benefits. It's not a total win for autoworkers, but it's a respectable compromise that warrants serious consideration. This strike goes beyond the basic needs and working conditions of GM employees. It taps into growing public support for unions.  According  to a recent Gallup poll, 64% of Americans approve of labor unions. Others are piling on, using the strike to advance a larger agenda for American labor like increased unionization and worker benefits. Union support has been expressed by many high-profile Democrats, such as Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Of the strike, Sanders  called  on GM to ""end the greed"" and Ocasio-Cortez  tweeted , ""In a time of record profits, workers should prosper, not suffer. That's why unions play a key role in an economy that works for everyone."" Politicians who truly stand with the American worker, should call for more thorough investigations into corruption claims like that of the UAW embezzlement scandal. They could also support the Department of Labor in their union transparency efforts, such as the recent  proposed T-1 Rule , which will bring transparency to union-controlled trusts and expose financial corruption in those funds. Both workers and GM are losing a lot of money as a result of the strike. However, the UAW is benefiting from its show of strength, as are politicians and pundits rushing to make use of the strike to advance their agendas.  For the sake of the autoworkers who want to continue making GM a success, the UAW needs to more carefully consider the best interest of workers."

THE SHADOW OF CORRUPTION How corrupt do you think your government is? 
According to Transparency International, which has been ranking countries on its 1-100 scale for 25 years, the United States is not very corrupt at all. 
The  most recent rankings , built through a survey of experts and businesspeople, ranks the U.S. as 22nd cleanest in the 180 nations of the world. We run in a pack with other mostly Western liberal democracies like Australia, Britain and France just behind the squeaky clean Scandinavian nations and, of course, Canada. 
We are far removed from the rampant corruption under which most of the rest of the world is forced to live. Russia, China, India and Brazil are all bad news when it comes to basic principles of fairness. All of Africa except for Botswana and every Asian nation except Japan are considered substantially corrupt.   
So your government, on an empirical basis, is pretty much on the level. 
But that’s not the important question. What matters is how corrupt do you  think  your government is. And on that score, the news is bad. 
In our most recent Fox News  poll , we asked respondents “How many people in the government do you think are corrupt -- almost all, many, some, or almost none?” The results should be sobering for everyone concerned about the current trajectory of politics. 
About one in five said that almost all of the people in government are corrupt. An amazing 43 percent said that “many” are crooked. Just 31 percent got closer to reality saying that “some” in the government are corrupt. A sad 2 percent said “almost none.” 
As with all reputational goods, like a nation’s currency, the perception of value is far more important than the actual value itself. If a government is perceived as corrupt it’s almost as bad as the real thing, and will eventually result in real corruption anyway. 
If you think the game is rigged, you’re far more likely to be willing to cheat yourself. 
The 64 percent of Americans who believe their government is rotten with corruption don’t belong to any particular demographic or political group, either. Women are a little more distrustful than men and white people are more dubious than other ethnic groups, whites without college degrees most of all. 
But religious faith, political proclivities, education and income all had relatively little bearing on the overall perception that corruption is a major problem in our government. 
It’s no wonder, given what both political parties are selling these days. It would be one thing if the response was really about “draining the swamp” and some sustained effort for reforms that might bring public perception back into alignment with reality. But what tends to happen is that politicians exploit such perceptions to create lower expectations for good government and accountability once they are in power. 
If the whole system is rigged, why should our side have to play by the rules? After all  they’re  the real crooks  
That’s how the false perception of rampant corruption makes way for the real thing. THE RULEBOOK: THERE’S A DIFFERENCE 
“It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.” –  James Madison ,  Federalist No. 14 TIME OUT: SOUNDS LIKE AMERICA Gun&Garden:  “When  Ken Burns  decides to cover a topic, set aside some time to dig in. Best known for his epics, including his  Civil War  documentary, which aired on PBS over five nights in 1990 to an audience of 40 million people, the filmmaker is now readying for the premiere his latest deep-dive,  Country Music . The eight-part, sixteen-hour film takes a magnifying glass to the forces that shaped this distinctly American sound. ‘I’m looking for stories, and I’m looking for stories that are firing on all cylinders,’ Burns tells  Garden & Gun . … The film runs chronologically, tracing the many influences that shaped country music, from enslaved people bringing the banjo across the Atlantic from Africa all the way to the heyday of pop-country in the mid-1990s. The genre, Burns reveals, is less a set of rules and boundaries than it is a spectrum—one that trades on universal truths and bridges cultural, racial, and economic divides.” Flag on the play? -  Email us at  HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM  with your tips, comments or questions.

BIDEN RACKS UP KEY ENDORSEMENTS AP:  “ Joe Biden  sought to demonstrate a broad appeal to Democrats on Thursday with new endorsements from leading African American lawmakers and a former governor of a pivotal swing state. The backing from Reps.  G.K. Butterfield  of North Carolina,  Emanuel Cleaver  of Missouri and  Charlie Crist  of Florida reflects Biden’s play both for the party establishment and for minority voters who are critical in the early stages of the primary. Butterfield and Cleaver are former chairmen of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Crist was the governor of Florida before he entered Congress. The moves are the latest example of Biden’s durability as an early Democratic front-runner. So far, he’s successfully threaded different wings of the party despite skepticism from progressives and questions about whether, at 76, he’s too old for the presidency. … [T]he support of Butterfield and Cleaver in particular is a potential blow to Sen.  Kamala Harris  [and] Sen.  Cory Booker …” Younger black voters try to pry their parents from Biden -  NYT:  “If Mr. Biden, 76, is going to win the Democratic nomination, it is likely to be because of the support of older black voters… But if he is to be overtaken by one of his more progressive rivals, the most powerful tool against him may not be opposition research or negative advertisements. Instead, it may be an organic effort by younger black voters — concerned about Mr. Biden’s age and more moderate ideology — to sway their older family members. Mr. Biden seems aware of this dynamic. In interviews, he has both acknowledged the generational gap among his black supporters and downplayed its importance, arguing that the support of older, more moderate black voters would be enough to give him an electoral advantage. Still, Mr. Biden, by his own admission, would be unwise to underestimate the lobbying efforts of those who are young and politically engaged.” Harris takes aim at Warren -  WSJ:  “Ka­mala Har­ris, now a dis­tant fourth in the De­mo­c­ra­tic pres­i­den­tial race, took aim at poll-climber  Eliz­a­beth War­ren  for do­ing big-money events. In re­sponse to a ques­tion about War­ren, Har­ris said at a closed-door fundraiser it was hyp­o­crit­i­cal for her ri­val to claim she wasn’t tak­ing money from large donors when War­ren trans­ferred around $10 mil­lion from her Sen­ate funds be­fore de­nounc­ing big money do­na­tions. Har­ris moved $1.2 mil­lion into her pres­i­den­tial fund. Har­ris lamented that she now needs to be in places like New York to keep the cam­paign fi­nan­cially afloat but prefers to spend time in early vot­ing states. On a later press call, Har­ris’s cam­paign didn’t name War­ren di­rectly but noted re­peat­edly that Har­ris came into the cam­paign with less than other can­di­dates be­cause ‘we spent 2018 rais­ing for other can­di­dates.’” And same with Buttigieg -   AP:  “Democratic presidential candidate  Pete Buttigieg  is accusing his 2020 rival Elizabeth Warren of being ‘extremely evasive’ when it comes to explaining how she'd finance a universal health care plan. Speaking on CNN on Thursday, Buttigieg issued his most pointed attack yet on the Massachusetts senator, saying she ‘was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we've seen that repeatedly.’ The sharpened critique comes as the fall campaign kicks into high gear with Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses scheduled in February. Warren has assembled a well-organized campaign there and leads Buttigieg in Iowa, where the South Bend, Indiana, mayor's longshot presidential campaign is competing heavily and trying to break through.” Yang plays Perot for a new generation -   Atlantic:  “To understand why [ Andrew Yang  is hanging on in the polls], it’s worth looking at how he responded earlier this month when  Shane Gillis , a comedian for Saturday Night Live, referred to him using a racial slur. Yang urged that Gillis not be fired. … But more revealing was Yang’s explanation for why Gillis deserved forgiveness. Gillis, Yang tweeted, ‘does not strike me as malignant or evil. He strikes me as a still-forming comedian from central Pennsylvania.’ What does central Pennsylvania have to do with it? For Andrew Yang and his supporters, everything. It’s code for economic distress—which Yang believes fuels racism and most of the other problems that menace America. … Over the past quarter century, two presidential candidates have mobilized these economics-first, culture-war-indifferent voters into a potent force. The first was  Ross Perot . The second is Andrew Yang.” De Blasiout -   Fox News:  “New York Mayor  Bill de Blasio  announced Friday he is dropping out of the 2020 Democratic primary, ending his campaign after struggling to gain traction in the race. ‘I feel like I contributed all I can to this primary election and it’s clearly not my time,’ he said during an appearance on MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe.’ ‘So I’m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City and I’m going to keep speaking up for working people.’ De Blasio entered the presidential race in May, running as a proud progressive. But his campaign never caught fire: He qualified for the first two rounds of Democratic presidential debates but has failed to make the cut for the others.” Booker hides from past alliance with DeVos -   WaPo:  “Cory Booker was a little-known member of the Newark City Council 19 years ago when he received an extraordinary invitation from a Michigan group connected to  Betsy DeVos , now the U.S. Secretary of Education. DeVos and her husband,  Dick , were leading Republican proponents of a state ballot initiative that would allow taxpayer-financed vouchers to pay for private schools. … Booker accepted. … But as Booker runs for president, his relationship with DeVos, his previous support of vouchers and his continuing praise for charter schools present potential roadblocks. Vouchers and charters schools are anathema to many powerful teachers unions, who have outsize power in Democratic primaries, and some candidates in the party strongly oppose them on the grounds that they weaken traditional public schools.” UKRAINE AT CENTER OF FIGHT OVER ALLEGED TRUMP PROMISE Fox News:  “The developing controversy over a mysterious phone conversation  President Trump  had with a foreign leader apparently centers on Ukraine, as the president and his allies fight back and claim the uproar is just another ‘partisan’ plot against him. What touched off the controversy is a secret whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ‘promise’ Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. Trump's attorney,  Rudy Giuliani , seemed to acknowledge some effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate potential corruption related to the Biden family, though he gave conflicting answers on the matter in a CNN interview overnight. It remains unclear what the supposed ‘promise’ from Trump entailed. The president, however, maintained he said nothing improper, tearing into those pushing the allegations Friday.” Giuliani inconsistent -  WaPo:  “Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, contradicted himself when asked whether he personally asked Ukraine to investigate former vice president  Joe Biden , ranted about media bias and defended Trump amid new reports about an intelligence official’s whistleblower complaint, during a chaotic and fiery CNN interview Thursday night. Immediately after anchor  Chris Cuomo  introduced him and summarized the latest news out of the whistleblower story, which had only broken about an hour prior, Giuliani went into attack mode. … Giuliani spent the first half of the interview repeating the claim that Biden in 2016 pressured Ukraine to drop its top prosecutor, which at the time was also investigating a natural gas company where Biden’s son  Hunter  was on the board. …There’s been no evidence found that Biden was trying to help out his son.” TRUMP RALLIES WITH MODI IN OUTREACH TO KEY VOTER BLOC WaPo:  “President Trump heads to Harris County, Texas this weekend to a major rally ahead of next week's United Nations General Assembly — for Indian Prime Minister  Narendra Modi . The website for the ‘Howdy, Modi’ rally boasts that the ‘live audience will be the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader visiting the United States other than the Pope’: Some 50,000 people, many from Houston's large Indian diaspora, are expected to turn out. It's eye-popping that leaders of the world's two biggest democracies are appearing together at such an event — let alone that this particular American president will be holding court in the epicenter of Texas's blue wave and the most diverse city in America. You're not wrong if you think that doesn't sound like friendly territory for Trump. But that's a strong political reason for him to go: Democrats are making a big play for Texas in 2020 and Republicans are growing concerned. The rally for Modi, who is hugely popular in India, provides Trump with access to a potential pool of Indian American voters that could turn out to be critical in next year's presidential elections.” SENATE DEMS NEED BIG WINS IN THE SUN BELT Politico:  “To take back the White House, Democrats only need to win back three key Rust Belt states. But if they want to move a president’s agenda through the Senate, they have to flip the Sun Belt. From Arizona to North Carolina to a pair of seats in Georgia, Democrats have to clean up in that stretch of the country to have any chance of taking the chamber. President Donald Trump carried each of those states in 2016, and in an era of polarized politics when Senate races are increasingly nationalized, Democrats need at least strong performances by the party's presidential nominee in the Sun Belt states — if not victories — to have a shot at flipping their Senate seats. So while some Democrats are laser-focused on winning back the Rust Belt, Democrats across the Southern half of the country are urging their party to invest heavily in their states — not just as a way to flip the Senate, but as part of the path to 270 Electoral College votes.” Kemp frustrates GOP with cattle call for Senate appointment -   AJC:  “Within hours of Gov.  Brian Kemp ’s unusual decision to invite the public to apply to succeed U.S. Sen.  Johnny Isakson , his office was blitzed with resumes — some serious and some silly — from wannabe Washingtonians.Lawyers. Doctors. Local government officials. Serial jokesters. IT specialists. A well-known pundit. As of Wednesday evening, 158 people had applied — and many, many more are expected to join in. … Welcome to the next phase of the race for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Chances are, Kemp and his advisers already have whittled a list of top contenders for Isakson’s seat down to a handful — and that the online application process unveiled late Tuesday will be largely for show. But encouraging would-be U.S. senators to publicly declare their ambition might just expand the scope of his search even as it forces some tough decisions on potential contenders.” PLAY-BY-PLAY Fox Poll: Voters are frustrated with government, nervous about economy   -  Fox News Trump files lawsuit in bid to protect personal, corporate tax returns from release  -  Fox News McConnell flips stance, announces support for $250 million in election security funding  -  WaPo Sanders becomes first Dem candidate to hit one million donors  -  Politico AUDIBLE: IOWA NICE?

"As with so much in the Trump presidency, it all starts with Hillary Clinton. Here's what we know: Giuliani's accusation Rudy Giuliani, the President's attorney and political attack dog, said on CNN Thursday night that his ongoing efforts to  pursue Clinton took him to Ukraine . First he alleged, without evidence, that she and Democrats were behind the effort to discredit Paul Manafort, who is currently in prison for, among other things, laundering money he was paid as a political consultant in Ukraine. Then things turned away from Clinton. ""In the course of investigating that, I found out this incredible story about Joe Biden, that he bribed the President of the Ukraine in order to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,"" said Giuliani, alleging a media coverup. ""That is an astounding scandal of major proportions, which all of you have covered up for five or six months."" From there the interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo went completely off the rails and Giuliani eventually admitted he had asked the current Ukrainian government to look into Biden. ""Of course I did!"" he said. But the President's attorney trying to get action from Ukraine is one thing. It would be something different entirely if the administration used official leverage to get a foreign country to investigate a US political rival, especially just months after special counsel Robert Mueller detailed multiple interactions between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia but found nothing rising to the level of coordination between campaign associates and officials and Russian governmental officials. Trump spoke with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 and that phone call may be part of what led to the complaint against Trump. Asked Friday about that July 25 call and whether he mentioned Biden to the Ukrainian President,  Trump tried to deflect back to Biden . ""It doesn't matter what I discuss,"" he said. ""But I will say this: Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case."" On Friday afternoon, the Wall Street Journal reported that on that phone call Trump pressured the new president ""about eight times"" to work with Giuliani on Biden, citing people familiar with the matter. Vice President Mike Pence recently met with Zelensky and was asked about Giuliani's efforts and whether the administration has held up aid to Ukraine as a result. REPORTER: Specifically, number one, did you discuss Joe Biden at all during that meeting yesterday with the Ukrainian President?  And number two, can you assure Ukraine that the hold-up of that money has absolutely nothing to do with efforts, including by Rudy Giuliani, to try to dig up dirt on the Biden family? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE:  Well, on the first question, the answer is no.  But we — with President Zelensky yesterday, we discussed — we discussed America's support for Ukraine and the upcoming decision the President will make on the latest tranche of financial support in great detail. Ukraine uses the aid in its efforts against Russian separatists, part of a long-term conflict with Russia. Biden's efforts in Ukraine Despite Giuliani's allegation, there has been no media coverup of the allegations against Biden.  The New York Times wrote about Biden's son  and his activities back in May and made clear that Trump's allies were pushing it. The President tweeted about it at the time. Since then, Trump, Giuliani and others have come back to the story repeatedly. Asked about Trump's statement Friday, Biden said ""Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion."" ""Not one single one, and so I have no comment except the President should start to be (the) President,"" Biden said. The crux of Giuliani's allegation is that Joe Biden tried to have Ukraine's top prosecutor ousted in 2016 because of an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. At the time, Hunter Biden was serving on Burisma's board. But the reality is much more nuanced. It is absolutely true that at the same time Burisma was being investigated, western governments, including the Obama administration wanted the prosecutor removed due to concerns about corruption in his own office. Biden too opposed  the prosecutor in Ukraine, Viktor Shokin, and threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine. He's actually bragged about it. Recounting a trip he made to Kiev in 2016, he said it showed the US was able to get Ukraine to take corruption more seriously. ""I looked at them and said: I'm leaving in six hours,"" Biden  said during an event at the Council of Foreign Relations in 2018 . ""If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" None of this is a particularly good look for the Bidens, but there's no proof or suggestion of any actual wrongdoing. At least one former official in the prosecutor's office said the investigation into Burisma had already been shelved by the time Joe Biden was threatening to withhold financial aid unless Ukraine replaced its top prosecutor. It's also not clear if Hunter Biden was a focus of that investigation when it was occurring. In an interview on May 14 posted on Facebook by his assistant, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yury Lutsenko said Burisma paid an entity connected to Hunter Biden ""millions,"" but added, ""from my point of view, a board member can be paid whatever a company decides ... they didn't violate any Ukrainian laws.""  He said that he said it was a matter for US law to consider, not Ukrainian investigators. Lutsenko in May said he was looking to ""reanimate"" an investigation of Burisma, Hunter Biden's former employer -- but that apparently never happened. Lutsenko left office in August after the new administration of Zelensky took office. Giuliani himself went to meet with a representative of Zelensky after the President's call with Trump in July. According to Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Ukrainian officials understand there is a link between what Giuliani was asking of the Ukrainians to do and getting US military aid. Murphy met with the Ukrainian President a few weeks ago and described the scene on Twitter. ""Zelensky did not explicitly connect the two in our meeting, but he was VERY concerned about the cut off of aid, and VERY aware of the conversations that Rudy Giuliani was having with his team. I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump's campaign operatives. He agreed,"" Murphy explained in a series of tweets.   Trump's playbook Fostering conspiracy theories about his rival was a strategy that worked for Trump in 2016 as he used decades of conservative conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton to label her ""crooked"" and suggest she should be in jail rather than the White House. Biden, however, is not followed by the same political taint as the Clintons and the effort by Trump and his allies may now have led to a whistleblower sounding the alarm under a law meant to protect intelligence officials for uncovering improper activity. The specifics of the whistleblower complaint remain a mystery and could remain that way as Trump's new acting Director of National Intelligence refuses to share information about the complaint with Congress. The Intelligence Community Inspector General has caused alarm by publicly saying he is being kept from doing his job. Father and son Hunter Biden's personal life and substance abuse issues have already caused angst for the former vice president. The overlap between the father and son's political and business interests have fueled GOP attacks that Biden is little more than a self-interested politician. Whether the facts fully support that case appears to be an afterthought for his critics. GOP researchers have been digging through Hunter Biden's career history as well as the points where it appears to intersect with his father's, particularly where it pertains to Ukraine and China, another topic Giuliani brought up during his interview with Cuomo."
"New revelations, and now a previously-unseen interview, raising questions over former Vice President Joe  Biden's  account of his handling of Anita  Hill's  1991 sexual harassment allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence  Thomas . Biden chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation hearing of Thomas and the committee heard testimony from Thomas and Hill.  Biden has repeatedly  claimed  that he believed Hill from the very beginning and that he did everything in his power to keep Thomas from being confirmed. 'SPECIAL INTERESTS' WANTS TO TARNISH KAVANAUGH, AS THEY DID THOMAS: CLARENCE THOMAS ADVISER However, Biden's account is challenged in the Fox Nation documentary  'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching '  and now Fox Nation is releasing previously-unseen interviews elaborating on these claims. In  'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching ',  former Senator Orrin Hatch R-Utah, who sat on the 1991 Judiciary committee with Biden, told Fox Nation that Biden told him during the hearings that he 'didn’t believe [Hill].'"" Longtime Thomas adviser and radio host, Armstrong Williams told Fox Nation that ""Biden assured [Thomas], repeatedly on the phone and in person, 'Clarence, you will be confirmed.'"" Now, in new interview material, Williams said ""Joe Biden wanted to vote for Thomas – remember.  Joe Biden is getting grief right now because [of the way] they say he treated Anita Hill...by and large, the Southern Senators and Biden liked Thomas."" Thomas' nomination was eventually confirmed by a narrow majority of 52 to 48.  Biden voted against sending Thomas to the Supreme Court. “Biden was always confidentially talking to Thomas saying ‘I’m with you. I’m with you.’  That’s something that people don’t know.  Biden was very much encouraging him, behind the scenes. Telling him to hang in there...Behind the scenes, no one could have been more gracious than Biden,"" Williams continued. WOULD IT GO VIRAL TODAY? EXPLOSIVE TESTIMONY IN THOMAS/HILL SAGA: NEW DOC Biden's handling of the hearings has long been a point of contention for his critics, who fault Biden for not allowing more witnesses, supportive of Hill, to testify. In March, Biden  lamented  his apparent inability to provide a different forum for Hill to air her allegations. ""To this day I regret I couldn't come up with a way to give her the kind of hearing she deserved,"" Biden said at a New York City event honoring young people who helped combat sexual assault on college campuses. ""I wish I could have done something."" According to Williams, Biden pro-actively prevented witnesses from making allegations that Biden deemed unfounded. ""Well, there were people that wanted to testify, who had no credibility, that the other side was pushing for -- Biden never allowed them on the docket."" FLASHBACK: KAVANAUGH'S WIFE RESPONDS TO SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HER HUSBAND “I have a lot of respect for Biden. I've always found Biden to be fair, compassionate and really could read the tea leaves of where things are going, because he did let [Thomas and me] know 'This is not going well.  But I am not going to allow what is garbage and unproven accusations...to make it into this hearing'.  I mean – there were his colleagues, who were angry with him about it, but Biden was a stand-up kind of guy. I know conservatives are not going to like it, but as far as I'm concerned Biden was always decent,"" said Williams. Williams also acknowledged that his account may not be politically-advantageous to Biden. “I had no issue with Biden during that process.  Biden did all he could – this may not help him on-camera – Biden did all he could to be fair to Judge Thomas at the time.  He could not have been more gracious and more communicative with the Justice at the time, and he apologized profusely.  He felt so bad [about] what was happening to him and these allegations.” 'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching'  is available exclusively on  Fox Nation.
