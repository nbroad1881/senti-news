"The Wall Street Journal reports that in a July phone call, President Trump repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son. The controversy over President Trump’s  mysterious call  with a foreign leader that prompted a whistleblower complaint ratcheted up Friday afternoon as a new report said it involved Trump asking the president of Ukraine numerous times in a single phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. Meanwhile, after Trump called the whistleblower a partisan and dismissed the allegation as “another political hack job,” Democrats in Congress accused the president of trying to intimidate whistleblowers and demanded the administration hand over the complaint and a transcript of the call, while 2020 hopefuls renewed calls for impeachment. CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. In a lengthy statement Friday evening, Biden said that if the reports were true ""there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.  ""This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,"" Biden continued. ""It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation—a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia—pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor ..."" ""At minimum,"" Biden concluded, ""Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress."" What initially touched off the  controversy is a secret  whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM   Trump called that initial story “ridiculous” in the Oval Office, and said he doesn’t know the identity of the whistleblower. He wouldn’t say what was discussed in the call but said someone should “look into” Biden family connections to Ukraine. ""I have conversations with many leaders. It's always appropriate. Always appropriate,"" Trump said. ""At the highest level, always appropriate. And anything I do, I fight for this country."" Afterward, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democratic committee leaders issued a statement demanding the administration hand over the complaint, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would not share details of it with lawmakers. “President Trump just went on national television—from the Oval Office—and personally attacked an Intelligence Community whistleblower who reported an urgent matter involving serious or flagrant misconduct,"" the statement said, adding that the ""brazen effort to intimidate this whistleblower risks a chilling effect on future whistleblowers."" After the publication of the Journal’s story, 2020 Democrats quickly weighed in. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro said that Trump “is a criminal.” “He must be impeached immediately,” he said. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said that Trump “appears to be collaborating with foreign governments to attack America’s democracy” before she urged the whistleblower to come forward. “I would absolutely urge this whistleblower to go directly to Congress, whether in closed session or in open session,” she said. Schiff told reporters Friday that the whistleblower claim ""deserves a thorough investigation."" ""Come hell or high water, that’s what we’re going to do,” he said. Democrats have been looking into whether Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure the government to investigate the Biden activities, and have also sought a transcript of the July call between Trump and Zelensky. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The inspector general for the intelligence community received the whistleblower complaint and, according to correspondence with Schiff, considered the allegations “credible” and dealing with an “urgent concern.” Inspector General Michael Atkinson wrote that the DNI, “after consulting with the Department of Justice,” determined the complaint does not have to be shared with the intelligence committees under law. He wrote that he will “abide by that determination,” but disagrees with it. In a letter Tuesday, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of ""urgent concern."" He said the complaint ""concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision."" Maguire is expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. after being subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee. Schiff had accused Maguire of withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioned whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general.

"The president defends his conversations with world leaders and blasts Joe Biden's 'disgraceful' statement on Ukraine during an Oval Office meeting with Australian PM Scott Morrison. The developing controversy over a mysterious phone conversation  President Trump  had with a foreign leader apparently centers on Ukraine, as the president and his allies fight back and claim the uproar is just another ""partisan"" plot against him. What touched off the  controversy is a secret  whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM   Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, seemed to acknowledge some effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate potential corruption related to the Biden family, though he gave conflicting answers on the matter in a CNN interview overnight. It remains unclear what the supposed ""promise"" from Trump entailed. The president, however, maintained he said nothing improper, tearing into those pushing the allegations Friday. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, alongside visiting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the president blasted the “ridiculous” story, blaming a “partisan whistleblower” and calling it “just another political hack job.” “I don’t know the identity of the whistleblower,” Trump said. He wouldn’t say what was discussed in the call but said someone should “look into” Biden family connections to Ukraine. He also argued the press has had “a bad week,” insisting he has prevailed in controversies reported by the media. “I guess I’m about 22 and 0, and I’ll keep it that way,” the president said. Afterward, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democratic committee leaders issued a statement demanding the administration hand over the complaint. “President Trump just went on national television—from the Oval Office—and personally attacked an Intelligence Community whistleblower who reported an urgent matter involving serious or flagrant misconduct,"" they said, adding that the ""brazen effort to intimidate this whistleblower risks a chilling effect on future whistleblowers."" Earlier Friday, Trump sounded off on Twitter, accusing Schiff of joining with the media to go after him once again. “The Radical Left Democrats and their Fake News Media partners, headed up again by Little Adam Schiff, and batting Zero for 21 against me, are at it again!” the president tweeted Friday. “They think I may have had a ‘dicey’ conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a ‘highly partisan’ whistleblowers statement.” He added: “Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!” For his part, Schiff told reporters Friday that the whistleblower claim ""deserves a thorough investigation."" ""Come hell or high water that’s what we’re going to do,” he said. Meanwhile, allies of the president took to the airwaves to downplay the story ""This is a clear example of someone from the deep state ... from the intelligence community,"" former  Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said on Fox News’  ""The Story with Martha MacCallum."" ""It was completely overblown. ... It will be a big nothing burger."" Fueling intrigue, Giuliani has raised questions about the activities of former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into that company. During an interview Thursday on CNN, Giuliani was asked whether he had asked Ukraine to look into Biden. Giuliani initially said, ""No, actually I didn't,"" but seconds later he said, ""Of course I did."" He explained that he sought for the government to look into how the case was dismissed. Later, Giuliani tweeted, ""A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job."" MATTHEW WHITAKER CALLS REPORTED WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT A 'CLEAR EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE FROM THE DEEP STATE' The whistleblower complaint has triggered a major showdown with Congress, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would not share details of it with lawmakers. The inspector general for the intelligence community received the complaint and, according to correspondence with Schiff, considered the allegations “credible” and dealing with an “urgent concern.” But the watchdog reported to the committee that his office is “at an impasse” with the director of national intelligence over the disclosure. Inspector General Michael Atkinson wrote that the DNI, “after consulting with the Department of Justice,” determined the complaint does not have to be shared with the intelligence committees under law. He wrote that he will “abide by that determination,” but disagrees with it. After a closed-door hearing Thursday with Atkinson, Schiff voiced concerns about not having access to the information, warning Congress could use legal action or budgetary powers as leverage. ""What’s at stake here goes well beyond this complaint and this president,"" he said. Schiff had subpoenaed Maguire saying he was withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioning whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general.

He said the complaint ""concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision."" Schiff said last week that Maguire is required to share the complaint with Congress and said the attempt to hold it back ""raises serious concerns about whether White House, Department of Justice or other executive branch officials are trying to prevent a legitimate whistleblower complaint from reaching its intended recipient, the Congress, in order to cover up serious misconduct."" Following Thursday’s Atkinson hearing, Maguire is still expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Democratic presidential candidate  Bernie Sanders  released a plan Saturday to eliminate  $81 billion in past-due medical debt , going a step beyond his primary rivals who have called for a government-run health insurance program. “In America today, it is unacceptable that one out of every six Americans have past-due medical bills on their credit report, totaling $81 billion,” Sen. Sanders, I-Vt.,  said in a statement , adding: ""It is immoral and unconscionable that families across the country are being evicted, having their heat disconnected, or having their already-inadequate wages garnished because of crippling medical debt while the health care industry made more than $100 billion in profits last year."" SUPREME COURT COULD HEAR GROUNDBREAKING CASE THAT CHALLENGES UN IMMUNITY   Under his plan, Sanders said, the federal government would step in for the individual to negotiate and pay off past-due medical bills in collections reported to credit agencies. Sanders also vowed to create a public credit registry to replace the three for-profit credit reporting agencies in order to, as he put it: “remove the profit motive from assessing the creditworthiness of American consumers.” He said the registry would use ""public, transparent algorithm to determine creditworthiness that eliminates racial biases in credit scores."" The self-described democratic socialist added that he would exclude medical debt from credit reports and end credit checking for rental housing, employment, insurance and other non-lending practices. BIDEN GOES ON THE ATTACK OVER UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, PLEDGES TO BEAT TRUMP 'LIKE A DRUM' Sanders made no mention in the proposal of how he planned to cover the $81 billion cost.  According to Reuters , the Sanders campaign has said they would pay for the debt elimination proposal through a tax on corporations based on their pay for chief executives. The details of that proposal have not been released. During an interview with Fox News Sept. 3, Sanders acknowledged that $81 billion is ""a lot of money,"" but he added, ""Compared to what? Compared to the $1.5 trillion that Trump gave in tax breaks to the one percent and large corporations. Compared to the billions of dollars that we spent bailing out the crooks on Wall Street 11 years ago. It is a lot of money but I think it’s the right thing to do.” Sanders was one of the earliest supporters of “Medicare-for-All,” which would replace job-based and individual health insurance with a government-run plan. Other top Democratic rivals have expressed interest in a toned-down version of Medicare-for-All. Sen.  Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass. has endorsed Sanders' plan but said there may be different ways to achieve coverage for all. Former Vice President  Joe Biden  has called to extend the Affordable Care Act by adding a public option. Sanders has also released a plan to eliminate $1.6 trillion in student loan debt while also making public college tuition-free. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As for where he draws the line in wiping out debt, Sanders in his Sept. 3 interview said ""there's a difference"" between wiping out medical debt and credit card debt. ""I don't believe we wipe out credit card debt. You want something, you pay for it.,"" he said. ""If you want to go out and buy a fancy house, you want to go out and buy a yacht, and you go in debt, hey that’s your decision…But I do believe we have to make a distinction. Getting cancer is not your decision. And I think we have a moral obligation to do everything we can to cancel that debt.”"

"WASHINGTON — Everyone here is keyed up for the Big One. The One that’s going to finally bring Donald Trump down. As soon as the news  broke Wednesday night in The Washington Post  that a whistle-blower had accused the president of making some sort of nefarious “promise” during a call to a foreign leader, the hive erupted. Democrats haven’t been able to get Trump on paying off a porn star to protect his campaign. They haven’t been able to get him on being a Russian agent. They haven’t been able to get him on obstruction of justice. But maybe this time. Maybe this was the One where all would decide that they wanted impeachment, that the president’s behavior was so outrageous that they couldn’t imagine this sleazy business guy sitting in the Oval Office playing a tinpot dictator in a tinfoil hat for another second. Maybe this was the One that would finally move Republicans to turn on the Grendel who is terrorizing the village and gulping down their party. Certainly, Trump himself didn’t think so. As the capital was going into overdrive-freak-out mode Friday night trying to flesh out the whistle-blower story, the president was busy tweeting about a children’s book by a Fox News host: “Buy this Book — great for the kids!” If House Democrats can ever get their paws on the whistle-blower, maybe they can make up for the Judiciary Committee’s performance with Corey Lewandowski this past week, which left many wondering if these hearings designed to pry Trump out of office are just making Democrats look foolish. They certainly provide an ample platform for Trump loyalists to rail against their favorite deep state foils. When failed presidential candidate Eric Swalwell tried to get Lewandowski to read a message Trump had dictated to him, the witness nastily referred to the Democrat as “President Swalwell” and told him to read the message himself. The internecine strains between the impeach-now Nadler crowd and the get-him-out-in-2020 Pelosi crew grew more bitter.  Politico reported  that in a closed-door meeting, Speaker Nancy Pelosi shocked lawmakers and aides by harshly criticizing the House Judiciary Committee staffers for propelling the impeachment effort far beyond where the Democratic caucus stands. “And you can feel free to leak this,” Pelosi said acidly. In an  interview with NPR , she said she hadn’t changed her mind on impeachment, but she does think Congress should pass new laws so future presidents can be indicted. She said everyone had now seen what the founding fathers could not imagine: a president blatantly abusing the Constitution he has sworn to protect. Trump has certainly been working hard to prove Pelosi right that presidents should not ever be above the law. By Friday night, while Trump was readying for a state dinner with his ultraconservative  pal from down under , Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison,   The Wall Street Journal and The Times  were reporting  that the secret whistle-blower complaint involved this: President Trump repeatedly pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine — about eight times,  The Journal said  — to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s loony personal lawyer, to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. Giuliani has been pushing a story about the former vice president and his son, who had ties to a Ukrainian oligarch. After a fair bit of babbling on Chris Cuomo’s CNN show, Giuliani spit out some truth, that he asked the Ukrainians to look into the Bidens. Later  he tweeted : “A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.” Crooked Donald thinks he can create a crooked Joe narrative just like he created a Crooked Hillary one. Which is it, Donald: Crooked or Sleepy? So just consider this: Around the same time that Trump escaped the noose after Robert Mueller’s tepid testimony, sliding away from charges that he colluded with a foreign country to interfere in our election, he began arm-twisting another foreign country to interfere in our election. “Questions have emerged,”  The Times said , “about whether Mr. Trump’s push for an inquiry into the Bidens was behind a weekslong White House hold on military aid for Ukraine. The United States suspended the military aid to Ukraine in early July, according to a former American official.” So the president is under suspicion of making like Nixon and abusing power to go after his enemies, saying it would be a shame if anything happened to that military aid that you want because you don’t dig up some dirt on the son of my political rival. The administration kept the whistle-blower’s complaint from Congress, even though Congress has the legal authority to know what this urgent complaint is about. Pelosi issued an acerbic statement on Friday, noting that Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, was violating the law by refusing to disclose the complaint to Congress. “If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,” she said. Trump is literally acting like an international mobster.  Roy Cohn would be so proud . So is this the Big One? We don’t know because so much has come before. But if it is? Now that would be Big.

"HOUSTON — A groan erupted at a  debate  watch party at Texas Southern University last week as former vice president  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  got a question about slavery and racism and  gave an answer about Venezuela and record players .  But amid that exasperation, some students channeled their inner Beltway operatives and began a targeted  rapid-response campaign.   Tyler Smith, 19, texted his grandmother after the debate, hopeful that Mr. Biden's meandering answer may have swayed her from supporting him.  Amaya St. Romain, 19, mounted a three-day lobbying blitz on her mother and her great-grandmother, making sure they had seen the former housing secretary  Julián Castro ’s criticisms of Mr. Biden onstage.  In  meme-speak ,  the efforts amounted to Killmonger, the villain in the Black Panther movie, challenging the people of Wakanda:  “Is this your king?”   “I think I’m definitely influencing them,” Ms. St. Romain said of her family members. “But my dad is definitely still pro-Biden. And I don’t really argue with him.”  If Mr. Biden,  76 , is going to win the  Democratic nomination , it is likely to be because of the  support of older black voters , a key constituency for the party  and one that polls show is overwhelmingly supportive of the former vice president’s candidacy .  But if he is to be overtaken by one of his more progressive rivals, the most powerful tool against him may not be opposition research or negative advertisements. Instead, it may be an organic effort by younger black voters — concerned about Mr. Biden’s age and more moderate ideology — to sway their older family members. Mr. Biden seems aware of this dynamic. In interviews, he has both acknowledged the generational gap among his black supporters and downplayed its importance,  arguing that the support of older, more moderate black voters  would be enough to give him an electoral advantage.  Still, Mr. Biden, by his own admission, would be unwise to underestimate the lobbying efforts of those who are young and politically engaged. At a gathering of the New Hampshire Young Democrats in July, Mr. Biden said the same phenomenon — young people converting their skeptical parents — had helped fuel his own ascension in politics almost 47 years ago, when he was elected to the Senate as a fresh-faced 29-year-old.  “The fact of the matter is, you have more influence on how your parents vote than they have on you,” Mr. Biden  said  in July. “You may sit at the dining room table, having dinner with your mom and dad, and say, ‘I met her and I really like her,’ or ‘I met him and I really like him.’ And your parents will pretend it didn’t matter much. But they’ll go up, not a joke, they’ll go up and say, ‘If my kid liked that person that much, and knew them, there must be something there.’”  At Texas Southern University, a historically black university founded in 1927 and the site of last week’s Democratic debate, dozens of students, ages 19 to 23, differed on their top candidate. Senators  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont,  Elizabeth Warren  of Massachusetts, and  Kamala Harris  of California were among the favorites, as was one of the two Texans in the race, former Representative  Beto O’Rourke .  For Mr. Biden, though, students carried mixed feelings. They respected his tenure as Barack Obama’s vice president, but implicitly rejected his campaign’s central premise, that the primary goal of Democrats in the 2020 election should be defeating President Trump.  They pointed to systemic problems they said the country must address, such as inequality, climate change and gun violence. The Democratic nominee, they said, should embrace progressive proposals like canceling student loan debt, the Green New Deal and gun buyback programs.  “Me and my dad have the debate all the time,” said Samantha Williams, 19, a sophomore. “We want a candidate that reflects us and what the world is going to look like when we run. But  he  says what we call ‘woke’ is really just sensitive.”  Jaylan Jones, 20, said, “Older people have that conservative outlook on things,” even older black Democrats.  “Young people don’t want Biden. We want Beto. We want Bernie,” said Ms. Jones, a junior. “I think we can convince them.”  The difference in opinion across generations speaks to the changing politics of black communities, said Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, the racial justice organization.  And the  historically diverse Democratic field  has given voters plentiful options to choose from: multiple black candidates, white progressives  who openly back once-radical ideas like reparations , and Mr. Biden, who served as vice president to the first black president.  Black voters are overwhelmingly members of the Democratic Party, and polls show they have long regarded Mr. Trump as a racist president and individual whom they are desperate to replace. A  recent national poll  of Democratic primary voters from NBC and The Wall Street Journal showed Mr. Biden had the support of nearly 50 percent with black respondents, though others have shown a less commanding lead. “Black people are strategic voters, particularly older black people,” Mr. Robinson said. “They’re thinking harm reduction. They’re doing a deep analysis about what they think white people will accept and won’t accept.” He pointed to the last Democratic primary, when younger black voters tracked more toward Mr. Sanders than their older counterparts, who overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton. In 2008, younger black voters supported Barack Obama in much bigger numbers than the electorate at large, until his victory in the Iowa Caucus led to a surge of support.  “Young people are constantly signaling what’s next and what’s possible,” Mr. Robinson said. “And while there’s some love for Biden, but sometimes you’re in a relationship because you’re comfortable and it’s what you know.”  Another Texas Southern student, Christopher Anwuri, 22, said the generational differences in how black voters saw the primary were fueled by opposing theories of political change: incrementalism versus immediate upheaval.  “This generation is looking for an instant, quick fix for problems,” he said. Older black people, meanwhile, think “these things need to take time.”  It also comes back to Mr. Obama, and  the long shadow he casts over national Democratic politics , particularly in black communities. Older black voters invoke his name in deference, and cite his embrace of  Mr. Biden  as something that helped him win the trust of skeptical white voters in 2008.  To younger generations, many of whom were in high school or younger at the time, Mr. Obama’s achievements exist on their own. Their first memories of Mr. Biden stem from his highly meme-able vice-presidential years. They are also more likely to hold his long and at times controversial record — on  criminal justice ,  school segregation  and the  Clarence Thomas hearings , among other things — against him.  Jayla Lee, 19, said older black voters “like Biden because he was with Obama, and they feel like since they could trust Obama that means they can trust him.”  “But the things we endure are not the things they endured,” Ms. Lee said. “And I’m looking for someone who can change the things that affect me.”  Darren Black, 22, said older generations were always “going to ride” for Mr. Biden, because “Joe was there with Obama.”  “But the younger generation, we've seen mass shootings, we’re seeing more police brutality — we’re looking at different things,” Mr. Black said.  Yet contrary to their stereotype as idealistic and apathetic, and with the steely pessimism of seasoned political operatives, younger voters expressed a cleareyed understanding that their efforts to lobby their relatives would not necessarily be successful.  Asked if she’d had any luck converting her family to more progressive candidates, Ms. Williams, a political science major, said, “I’m making no progress. None. Not even a tiny bit. I wish.” Ms. Williams called her pro-Biden father a lost cause. “We’re both opinionated and headstrong people, a nd I just don’t have the energy to go back and forth,” she said.  Mr. Smith, a member of the school’s College Democrats, said he liked Mr. Biden, but preferred his more left-wing rivals, such as Mr. O’Rourke, Mr. Castro, Ms. Harris or Ms. Warren.  After the debate, he thought about further pestering his grandmother over her support for Mr. Biden, but he reconsidered out of fear of coming off as pushy.  “You know, it’s grandma, so you got to let her have it,” Mr. Smith said.  When reached by phone, however, Mr. Smith’s grandmother, Alice Varnado, said his previous lobbying efforts had been more successful than he may have realized.  Ms. Varnado, 69, said she still preferred Mr. Biden, but that she had grown concerned about his age in recent months. She said she would vote for whichever Democrat earned the nomination, but she now considers Ms. Warren her second choice.  Her family members — Mr. Smith and his uncle — had convinced her. “You know, since talking with my grandson and my son, I think I can go with her,” said Ms. Varnado. “I’m starting to like her. There’s been a turning point.”  Katie Glueck contributed reporting."
"Elizabeth Warren  did not want a goodbye party. She told her aides there would be no grand send-off, no celebration of a mission accomplished. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had been her idea from the start: a new arm of the government, uniquely empowered to police the kinds of loans and financial schemes that led to the Great Recession. Ms. Warren had detailed the idea in a journal article, then cajoled and pressured Congress to make it law. She was tasked by President Barack Obama in 2010 with setting up the bureau, and spent a year recruiting investigators and enforcers for an office they saw as an exhilarating cause. But as spring turned to summer in 2011, Ms. Warren faced a wrenching separation. The White House had decided not to nominate her to lead the bureau permanently. So she gathered the staff for an “all hands” meeting and told them her work there was over. “She told us that we were ready to sail the ship, that we did not need her there, and that we would be able to do it on our own,” said Patricia McCoy, a Boston College law professor who was a senior official at the bureau. Ms. Warren was right. Under her successor, Richard A. Cordray, the bureau would recover $12 billion for consumers from financial institutions by 2017. It would become, to supporters, a prized example of the government taking on big banks after the 2008 financial crisis. To opponents — Republican lawmakers, business associations and a few conservative Democrats — it would become an example of “runaway government,” an agency to be curbed at the first  opportunity . To Ms. Warren, the bureau is something else as well: a formative lesson in how an idea — a plan — can become reality. For it was through creating a new financial regulator that Ms. Warren developed the approach to government that now guides her  presidential campaign . And it was in losing the chance to lead her bureau that Ms. Warren came to see the value of asking voters, rather than a president, to give her power. A review of Ms. Warren’s role in creating the consumer bureau, including interviews with more than 30 people involved in the process, revealed an approach to politics that joins imaginative policy ideas with a keen instinct for mass communication and a willingness to negotiate. On one hand, she marshaled support from progressive activists and helped build public demand for her idea; on the other, she haggled with members of Congress to earn their backing. David Axelrod, who was Mr. Obama’s top political adviser during the battle to create the C.F.P.B., called Ms. Warren’s role a “bona fide credential” for the presidency. “There aren’t that many people who can say they had an idea, wrote about it and ended up bringing it to fruition, in terms of the creation of a whole new government agency with a very focused mission,” Mr. Axelrod said. If some of Ms. Warren’s rivals — and more than a few Democratic voters — question whether her ideas are realistic, she and her supporters answer by pointing to the consumer bureau. At the New Hampshire Democratic Party’s convention this month, supporters of Ms. Warren broke out in chants of, “C-F-P-B! She fights for you, she fights for me!” In a recent interview, Ms. Warren described the creation of the bureau as a “model” for how she would seek to deploy her plans as president. At  a September rally  in Washington Square Park in New York, Ms. Warren likened herself to Frances Perkins, the first secretary of labor — a woman, she said, “who worked the political system relentlessly from the inside, while a sustained movement applied pressure from the outside.” But if the bureau has been an enduring victory for Ms. Warren, it culminated in a painful disappointment.  In the interview, Ms. Warren — an upbeat presence on the campaign trail — became somber when the conversation turned to her exit from the bureau. Asked about her insistence against having a farewell party, her eyes began to  glisten .  “I couldn’t say goodbye to all those people I’d hired and all those people I’d brought in to fight,” Ms. Warren said, speaking slowly and quietly. “I’d made an implicit promise to lead the charge, and I would’ve stayed and led it if I could have. But I couldn’t. And I did not want to say goodbye to all of them.” Ms. Warren’s band of advisers, lawyers, researchers and technicians devised a more discreet send-off. Elizabeth Vale, a former White House official who was among Ms. Warren’s close counselors, said an immense farewell card was made from a “big, big, big piece of cardboard,” stamped with the electric-green logo of the C.F.P.B. and signed by scores of staff members. Still, Ms. Warren, then 62, declined to receive it before a throng of colleagues. “I remember two of us brought it to her,” Ms. Vale said, “and then I remember when she walked out, she just walked out quietly, by herself.” An Idea About Exploding Toasters It all began with Ms. Warren’s decision to write an article in the winter of 2007. She had endured one unhappy brush with Washington, testifying against a bill to tighten the bankruptcy code in a way she feared would burden low-income debtors. The proposal became law in 2005, with Joseph R. Biden Jr., then a senator, as its leading Democratic supporter. Back at Harvard,  where she was teaching law, Ms. Warren began considering a new idea: a proposal for a government regulator to address the issue on which Congress had spurned her advice — the problem of consumer credit and the often-deceptive financial products being offered to ordinary people. She outlined the concept to Kenneth Baer, then 34, a former Clinton administration aide who with several like-minded Democrats had founded a publication, Democracy, to stir an ambitious policy debate among liberals. He was skeptical at first of Ms. Warren’s regulatory proposal, wondering if forming a new government agency represented an “old Democratic way of thinking.” But Mr. Baer and his colleagues were hungry for big ideas to fill what they saw as an intellectual void in the Democratic Party, and he encouraged her to make the case for a new regulator. In a February email to Mr. Baer, Ms. Warren agreed to write it. As she tells it now, she was bursting for the chance. “The idea was ripe,” she said. “I was ready.” A draft of the piece followed in late March. Ms. Warren urged her collaborators to “edit aggressively,” an instruction that proved unnecessary. A copy of her first version reviewed by a reporter shows its now-famous opening was scarcely  changed . “In the U.S. today it is not possible to buy a toaster that has a 1-in-5 chance of bursting into flames and burning down a customer’s house,” Ms. Warren wrote in her draft. “But it is possible to refinance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same 1-in-5 chance of putting the family out on the street — without ever disclosing that  fac t to the homeowner.” When Democracy published Ms. Warren’s article in the summer of 2007, Mr. Baer and his colleagues promoted it — and its author — vigorously, booking Ms. Warren on CNN and winning coverage for her idea in national newspapers. And they promoted it to presidential campaigns, too. A breakthrough came in June when Heather McGhee, a policy adviser to Senator John Edwards, emailed Ms. Warren to say her candidate was about to endorse a new regulator for financial products. By early 2008, Ms. Warren and her sometime editors were musing over email that the proposal could really become law. When Ms. Warren noted praise for her idea in Newsweek, Andrei Cherny, a co-founder of Democracy, wrote back, “Next stop: law of the land!” “I’m working on it!” Ms. Warren replied, signing off with her initials, EW, in lowercase. It had been decades since either political party had tried seriously to impose tougher financial regulations. Even sympathetic Democrats, like Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, questioned the feasibility. Ms. McGhee, who stayed in touch with Ms. Warren after the Edwards campaign ended, said she saw the professor straining to discern what to do and whom to turn to in Washington. “She really was trying to figure out how to have all the right conversations,” Ms. McGhee said. “And then the financial crisis happened.” A Two-Sided Game The Congressional Oversight Panel, a body set up to scrutinize Washington’s bailout of the financial system, did not mention toasters in its “special report” on financial regulation. But the document, issued days after Mr. Obama’s inauguration in 2009, was unmistakable in its suggestion. The report recommended creating a financial regulator that could gather up the fragmented enforcement tools of the federal government and seek to avert another financial crisis. It was a natural suggestion for the oversight body, since Ms. Warren was its chairwoman.  Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader at the time, had named her to the post at the end of 2008, in the throes of a global financial catastrophe that sent unemployment soaring and threw millions of homeowners into foreclosure. From this perch, Ms. Warren began a campaign for her bureau. It was no longer a lonely effort. Mr. Frank, a powerful committee chairman, was now an ally. So was an emerging coalition of progressive groups, labor unions and consumer advocates, known as Americans for Financial Reform. Ms. Warren sought out its leader, Heather Booth, for insight into political organizing. “She knew many of the players on the policy side,” Ms. Booth said. “What she hadn’t been experienced with were the politics.” Ms. Warren also built alliances inside government, finding friends in people like Mr. Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett, one of Mr. Obama’s closest advisers. Mr. Axelrod saw the bureau as a political necessity, the one part of financial reform ordinary voters might understand. At times, Ms. Warren’s appeals were strikingly personal: Over dinner in Cambridge, Mass., Ms. Warren told Ms. Jarrett much of the life story that is now familiar to voters who follow her campaign, a tale of deep economic adversity for her family in Oklahoma. “It put in context why this policy was so important to her,” Ms. Jarrett said. Mr. Obama embraced the proposal, putting a consumer bureau in his blueprint for financial reform in the spring of 2009 and talking on late-night television about exploding toasters. Ms. Warren was elated but uneasy. The financial industry was mobilizing, warning that a new regulator would damage the economic recovery. And Ms. Warren was concerned about two of Mr. Obama’s lieutenants: Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, who helmed the National Economic Council. She had profound philosophical disagreements with both men, who believed that her savage criticism of the bank bailouts revealed a misunderstanding of the role of Wall Street in the fragile economic recovery. “Tim and Larry were not fans of this agency,” Ms. Warren said. “I heard more than once from Senate and House staffers that they had proposed scrapping it in return for some other concession that they cared more about.” Of Mr. Obama, she said: “I never worried about the president. I was worried about his advisers.” Mr. Obama remained forcefully supportive and senior officials at the Treasury Department helped negotiate the shape of the bureau at every stage. In the House, Ms. Warren blessed deals struck by Mr. Frank, including one exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from certain new regulatory requirements. The concession was intended to win over an influential trade group, the Independent Community Bankers of America, and its chief lobbyist, Cam Fine. The arrangement dismayed the left — until Ms. Warren endorsed it. “She was very realistic,” Mr. Frank said. “She was deeply engaged in talking to members and she did acquire her own sense of what was politically doable.” Ms. Warren had less influence in the Senate, where Democrats held the majority but their ability to break a filibuster hinged on centrist legislators. So Ms. Warren turned her attention beyond the chamber, rallying activists and talking to the media. In her most provocative move,  she told HuffPost  that the Senate must either create a “strong consumer agency” or have “no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor.” “That,” Ms. Warren said recently, “is the outsider’s game.” The Senate ultimately approved a bureau that was stronger in some ways than Ms. Warren’s 2007 proposal. Instead of a Financial Products Safety Commission, led by committee, it would be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, headed by a single director. And it would draw funding from the Federal Reserve, putting its budget beyond reach of adversaries in Congress. Ms. Warren attended the July 2010 ceremony where Mr. Obama signed the Dodd-Frank bill into law, and with it a consumer bureau that he asked her to help set up. He designated her an aide to himself and to Mr. Geithner, with a mandate to build the regulator she had devised on paper in 2007. There was no promise she would become the permanent director. If Ms. Warren had won a landmark policy victory, it came at the cost of making enemies in Congress and the administration. While Mr. Geithner would criticize business groups for opposing the consumer bureau in a 2014 book, he also cast Ms. Warren as an implacable critic of the bank rescue, more focused on “made-for-YouTube” grandstanding than on crafting practical ideas. He and Mr. Summers described her in White House meetings as unreasonably hostile to financial institutions, and as simply unreasonable. “You cannot play the role she was playing without making people mad at you,” said former Representative Brad Miller, a North Carolina Democrat involved in drafting Dodd-Frank. He said of the Obama economic team, “Those were folks who were used to getting their own way and not having to deal with critics at all.” Mr. Geithner, now president of the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed. Mr. Summers, who has criticized some of Ms. Warren’s 2020 campaign proposals, did not respond to interview requests. But Ms. Warren at times unnerved others in the administration. In a 2015 memoir, Mr. Axelrod wrote that Mr. Obama grew frustrated in 2010 with Ms. Warren’s assertive efforts to position herself to become director — a possibility he feared would enrage banks and doom the Dodd-Frank bill. “Tell her to keep her mouth shut,” Mr. Obama said, according to Mr. Axelrod’s book. “She may well be the choice, but we can’t surface that now.” ‘That Was Her Job’ In the spring of 2011, Mr. Fine, the lobbyist for community banks, got a call from Ms. Jarrett. If the White House selected Ms. Warren to lead the consumer bureau, she asked, would he fight for her confirmation? Mr. Fine said he would. A few days later, Ms. Warren told Mr. Fine over lunch in downtown Washington that the White House had decided against nominating her. “I said: ‘That’s just not right. Do you want me to start a campaign? Do you want me to demand a meeting over at the White House?’” said Mr. Fine, whose offers Ms. Warren declined. “She put on a brave face.” For Ms. Warren, this setback came at the end of a whirlwind year setting up the bureau. Since Dodd-Frank became law, Ms. Warren had traveled widely and hired aggressively. Eager to show her organization was at work, she demanded swift, visible actions, like the creation of a complaint hotline with a public catalog of Americans’ grievances against banks and other lenders. Her recruitment efforts had established the bureau as a political force, as well as a legal one. The staff swelled, and weekly meetings shifted from a modest conference room to an elevator-studded lobby. In a pair of public-relations coups, Ms. Warren asked Holly Petraeus, a Better Business Bureau official married to a renowned general, to lead the Office of Servicemember Affairs, and enlisted Mr. Cordray, the outgoing attorney general of Ohio, to lead her enforcement division.  “As she put it to me: It’s a chance to do on a nationwide basis what you’re doing in Ohio, with more tools, more authority to pursue the banks,” Mr. Cordray said, recalling Ms. Warren’s pitch. It was a chance, in other words, to wield great power. But Ms. Warren would soon learn that hers was borrowed power — power delegated by the president, and for only a year. By the spring of 2011, the opposition to Ms. Warren becoming permanent director was unbending. Republican senators said they would never confirm her; so did Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, a conservative Democrat. Mr. Nelson, who is supporting Mr. Biden in the Democratic primary, said in an interview that he worried about empowering someone he saw as a champion of “runaway government.” “I was very concerned about somebody who had been such a strong advocate for a government bureau that had virtually no control,” Mr. Nelson said. Mr. Reid said Republican opposition sealed Ms. Warren’s fate. “The Republicans stopped her from getting that job,” he said. “That was her job.” Among some of Ms. Warren’s allies, frustration lingers about what happened in 2011. They blame not just Republicans, but also her rivals in the Obama administration and a harsh strain of sexism directed at her by political opponents and the media. “Men never get this adjective, ‘strident.’ That bothers me, because I don’t think she is,” Ms. Petraeus said. “Yes, she’s passionate. She doesn’t hesitate to call somebody out, especially on the Hill, if they’re trying to serve up a bunch of double-dealing nonsense.” Sheila Bair, a Warren ally who was then at the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,  said she had been angry to learn the White House was leaning against nominating Ms. Warren. Her detractors in the administration, Ms. Bair said, had been “whispering behind the scenes that she couldn’t get confirmed.” “Even if that is true, fight it out,” Ms. Bair said. In the end, Mr. Obama concluded Mr. Cordray stood a better chance of clearing the Senate. Republicans would stonewall his nomination until 2013. It was Ms. Jarrett who called to inform Ms. Warren. She also suggested an alternative path forward: running for Senate. “She was not overly enthusiastic in our first call, because she never saw herself as a politician,” Ms. Jarrett said, “and I said I thought that’s the reason she’d be perfect for the job.” Others in the administration, including Mr. Geithner’s aides, saw the Senate race as a way to get Ms. Warren out of the executive branch. Mr. Miller, the former congressman, said he emailed Ms. Warren to warn that her critics might be trying to lure her “into a race that she could not win.” But in September 2011, Ms. Warren entered the race against Senator Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts, starting down a path that has led with improbable speed to a presidential campaign. Her candidacy today resembles a vastly enlarged version of the movement that gave rise to the consumer bureau. In a campaign framed as a crusade of ideas, Ms. Warren has vowed to restructure the economy as president using the same methods that helped make her imagined agency a real structure of concrete and glass. It is not lost on Ms. Warren that, had she become the director, it is unlikely she would be a leading presidential candidate now. “I would have stayed,” she said, “and done it forever.”"
"""We have a Senate that instead of trying to harness the opportunity and potential of every person in this country, they're trying to pull us back,"" Kennedy said Saturday in announcing his run. ""And I'm running for the United States Senate to tear that down, to fight back with everything we've got."" In recent weeks, Kennedy, 38, has sought to draw a generational contrast with Markey, 73, while benefiting from the goodwill shown for the generations of Kennedys who have represented the state before him.  In a campaign email Saturday, Kennedy lists conversations he's had with constituents following President Donald Trump's election and ""outdated structures and old rules"" as reasons he decided to enter the Senate race.  ""This is the fight of our lives, the fight of my generation — and I'm all in,"" he said.  Kennedy is the heir to a political dynasty that has never lost an election in the state, the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy and the son of former Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy II. One great uncle, Ted Kennedy, served in the Senate for nearly 50 years. Another, John F. Kennedy, won his first congressional race in 1946, when Markey was born. Kennedy drew on his family's long ties to Massachusetts in his announcement Saturday. ""It's extremely meaningful to me to be able to do this here, where in 1848 a few steps from where this building is today, my father's family first arrived here in this country,"" he said. Kennedy told reporters on Thursday that Markey is ""a good man,"" but had other issues he wanted to address in the race. Kennedy volunteered for the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic and worked as an assistant district attorney for Massachusetts before his election to Congress in 2012.  Last year, Kennedy gave the Democratic party's official response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, calling for a ""better deal,"" a ""living wage,"" paid leave, affordable child care, ""solvent"" pensions, ""fair"" trade pacts, good roads and a ""health care system that offers mercy, whether you suffer from cancer or depression or addiction."" He also turned his sights on the President. ""Bullies may land a punch,"" he said. ""They might leave a mark. But they have never, not once, in the history of our United States, managed to match the strength and spirit of a people united in defense of their future."" Some viewers focused less on his message and more on his mouth, wondering about his shiny lips. In 2019, Kennedy gave some advice to this year's speaker, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, tweeting to ""misplace your chapstick."" In the past several weeks, as the congressman's interest in the Senate seat became clear, Markey lined up prominent Democratic endorsements. His backers include fellow Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a presidential candidate, and  over 100 state legislators , including House Speaker Robert DeLeo and Senate President Karen Spilka.  ""I endorsed Ed Markey six months ago, seven months ago. I've cut a video for him. Eddie has been a great partner in the Senate,"" Warren told reporters last month, referencing her February decision. ""I think I know why you're asking that and if it's about Joe Kennedy, I will also say Joe Kennedy is also a great partner. He and Lauren were both my students and I worked with Joe before either one of us was in politics and have worked with him ever since he's been in Congress. He's really an amazing person."" US Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democrats' campaign arm and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the firebrand freshman, also back Markey. ""I'm going to run on all the issues I've been fighting for today and into the future: climate change, income inequality, a woman's right to choose and on gun safety legislation,"" said Markey this week. ""I am going to continue those fights into this campaign and I will do so every day that I'm out there crisscrossing the state of Massachusetts and fighting for the people of our state."" Rep. Lori Trahan, Democrat of Massachusetts, has endorsed Markey and said that Kennedy's entry to the race will not change her mind. She told CNN she supports Markey for his leadership on both local and national issues, including his work  addressing pipeline explosions  in her district and his role sponsoring the Green New Deal. She added that even though she's for Markey, ""I think the world of Joe."" Other Massachusetts Democrats are so far keeping out of the race, including Reps. Seth Moulton and Ayanna Pressley, who won their House seats through taking on sitting congressmen in primary campaigns in 2014 and 2018. Moulton told CNN that both Kennedy and Markey are ""great progressive leaders for the state."" In an interview, Pressley said she looked forward to continue working with Markey on environmental and gun control issues, while working with Kennedy on mental health care.  ""I think primaries are healthy,"" Pressley added. When asked about whether he had tried to flip the endorsements of his fellow members of Congress, Kennedy told reporters on Thursday that he respected the decisions that they've made.  ""The race is going to be decided by the people of Massachusetts,"" Kennedy said."
"The Deep State tried to use an illegitimate tool to throw up a smokescreen to distract the American people from President Trump's success, says former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. Republicans in  Congress  defended  President Trump  on Friday after a report said a ""whistleblower"" filed a complaint over an apparent July phone call between the president and the leader of Ukraine, blasting the allegations as ""highly partisan."" “It’s not like we haven’t seen this movie before,"" U.S. Rep.  Jim Jordan , R-Ohio, told the Washington Post. ""Democrats come out, they’re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out -- Whoa, different story! “This seems to be the same kind of deal,"" Jordan added. “It’s not like we haven’t seen this movie before. Democrats come out, they’re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out -- Whoa, different story!"" WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM The complaint made by an unnamed intelligence official, reportedly involved Trump asking Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son for alleged wrongdoing while the elder Biden was vice president. U.S. Rep.  Mark Meadows , R-N.C., echoed the idea that such complaints hamper the president in his work. “It would have a real chilling effect on dialogue between important leaders if they think that every time someone who overhears a conversation that wasn’t even party to the conversation is going to file a whistleblower complaint and it’ll end up on the front page of periodicals across the country,” Meadows said, according to The Post. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., said private phone calls with foreign leaders are part of the president’s job. “The fact is, the president, to quote John Marshall, is the ‘sole organ’ of U.S. external relations and has to have conversations in confidence with foreign leaders,"" he said. “There’s no practical way to conduct diplomacy without it.” “The fact is, the president ... has to have conversations in confidence with foreign leaders. There’s no practical way to conduct diplomacy without it.” But he added he’s in favor of transparency. The administration is also taking flak for not sharing the complaint with Congress. Most Republicans avoided commenting on the complaint, and while a few did express concerns, they were limited. Rep. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., said it would be “wildly inappropriate” for a president to ask a foreign government to get involved in a U.S. election, but added he isn’t accusing Trump of doing that. Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, broke with Republicans in saying some on his side of the aisle might join Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., in subpoenaing the president's phone records. “It’s certainly on the table,” he said. “When I say that I want to protect congressional oversight, I really mean that.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump has denied any impropriety and in a Twitter message Friday, he called the unidentified whistleblower ""highly partisan,"" The  Post  reported."
"Sen. Cory Booker's staff has been put on notice that he has until the end of September 2019 to raise $2 million or he will be dropping out of the race; former DNC Chair Donna Brazile reacts. Sen.

BOOKER VOICES CONCERNS OVER BIDEN'S ABILITY 'TO CARRY THE BALL' The existence of the memo was first reported Saturday morning by NBC News, with Fox News confirming the news with multiple sources. Two sources, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said it was no accident that the memo was leaked, and described it as an effort to spark a surge in fundraising over the next 10 days.  And a campaign memo sent to political reporters Saturday morning said: “This isn't an end-of-quarter stunt or another one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press. This is a real, unvarnished look under the hood of our operation at a level of transparency unprecedented in modern presidential campaigns.” Booker, who declared his candidacy for the White House in early February, quickly built a formidable operation in the early voting primary and caucus states.

"According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump did not offer a quid pro quo to Volodymyr Zelensky during the July call; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports. As Congress and the White House wrestle over a whistleblower’s complaint against  President Trump , the story took a new turn late Friday when the  Wall Street Journal reported  that, in a July phone call, Trump “repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine” to investigate the dealings of Joe Biden’s family in Ukraine. Trump’s call is reportedly the source of a complaint by a whistleblower against the president that has sparked a furor among Democrats in Congress, who are demanding to see the complaint. If, as multiple news organizations are reporting, the whistleblower’s complaint centers on Ukraine, there is strong evidence that it relates to President Trump’s urging the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son. NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT The story behind that story is itself worthy of serious scrutiny. The proposed investigation involves Hunter Biden’s involvement with a controversial Ukrainian natural gas company while then-Vice President Biden was overseeing America’s Ukraine policy. Critics of the president have accused Trump of attempting to “extort” Ukrainian officials for “dirt” on Biden, the current front-runner for the Democratic nomination to run against Trump next year. But why would Ukraine have dirt on Joe Biden? For answers, one must look at Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company which, until earlier this year, employed Hunter Biden. In April 2014,  Hunter Biden agreed  to join Burisma’s board of directors, ostensibly to advise on legal issues, The New Yorker reported. Biden had no known expertise on the natural gas industry, but Burisma was certainly in need of help. Earlier that month, British officials  had frozen  the London bank accounts of Burisma’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, and soon after, Ukrainian officials opened their own  corruption investigation  into Burisma, the Kyiv Post in Ukraine reported. Hunter Biden helped to recruit a legal team for Burisma, including former Obama administration Justice Department official John Buretta and several American consulting firms, The  New York Times reported. The younger Biden was well compensated for his efforts. Records obtained by the Government Accountability Institute show he was paid as much as $83,333 per month for his work at Burisma. Hunter Biden claims he had no role in the investigation of the company, and that he never spoke about it with his father – but the facts show a troubling overlap with the Obama administration’s actions in Ukraine. On April 16, 2014, White House records show that Devon Archer, Hunter Biden’s business partner, made a private visit to the White House for a meeting with Vice President Biden. Five days later, on April 21, Joe Biden landed in Kiev for a series of high-level meetings with Ukrainian officials. Soon the United States and the International Monetary Fund would be pumping more than $1 billion into the Ukrainian economy, as  I wrote in the New York Post . CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The next day, there was a public announcement that Archer had been asked to join the board of Burisma. Three weeks after that, on May 13, it was officially announced that Hunter Biden would join, too. Like Hunter Biden, Archer had no background or experience in the energy sector. In March 2016, Ukrainian officials fired Viktor Shokin, the controversial prosecutor general whose office was overseeing the investigation into Burisma, The  New York Times reported . Six months later, the Burisma case was dropped entirely, the  Kyiv Post reported . According to Joe Biden himself, the former vice president played a key role in the prosecutor’s dismissal. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In March 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loans if Shokin was not fired, according to Biden, who recounted the exchange in  a 2018 speech : “I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b----. He got fired.” While the propriety of Trump’s call to the Ukrainian president is certainly questionable and worthy of inquiry, the investigation he was hoping for certainly seems warranted on its own merits.

"We've experienced the peaceful transfer of power for 230 years, including the constitutionally messy outcomes in 1876, 1888, 2000 and, well, 2016 for that matter. No tanks rolled through the streets and no shadow governments operated from underground bunkers even when the guy with the most votes didn't end up in the White House.  So why in 2019 do so many Americans -- across party lines --  believe  that if their candidate loses next year it can only be because the election was rigged?  Here's one place we can look: For the third time in his presidency, Donald Trump has an 86-point gap between what Republicans and Democrats think about him, according to the  latest Gallup approval poll . Ninety-one percent of Republicans approve of his job performance to date, while only 5% of Democrats feel the same.   This ties the highest gap  Gallup has ever measured in a single survey. President Obama had an 86-point gap two days before his reelection in 2012. President Bush hit the low 80s twice in the run up to his reelection. Reagan only made it into the 70s -- also in the fall of 1984. In all 3 cases, the partisan divide peaked during the days and weeks before a highly contested election.  We are still 14 months away from Election Day. But Americans on both sides appear primed and ready to vote.  Just four years ago , only 32% of voters said they were ""extremely interested"" in the 2016 election. But this week, that same poll shows 59% are extremely interested this time around. And if you only include self-identified partisans, the number jumps into the 60s.  And with stakes this high, Democratic voters appear to be grappling with their own dilemma: vote for a candidate who best exemplifies their visceral loathing for Donald Trump or vote for the candidate who is most likely to beat him?  Current polling shows the race for the Democratic nomination  is tightening  between Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren. But that doesn't mean voters are picking between them.  The polls are pretty clear that Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters  would prefer  to vote for Elizabeth Warren.  They think  she's won every debate so far. And as the 20,000 people who showed up to her New York City rally this week can attest, she leads Biden in voter  enthusiasm  by double digits.  But  nearly half  of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters believe that Biden is best positioned to beat Trump. Barely 1 in 10 think that of Warren.  If history is any indication, there's every reason to suspect the partisan divide heading into 2020 will get worse. After all, that 86% gap just means we have 14% more to go.   All of this is a big problem for Elizabeth Warren.   As David Leonhardt noted in the  New York Times  this week, Warren has struggled to win blue collar workers (you remember: the ones that gave Trump his narrow wins in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania?) in her own state of Massachusetts since 2012. She underperformed even her fellow down ballot Democrats in the last election. Voters on both sides of the aisle in these swing states are tuned in and eager to vote, but Biden out performs her in a head to head with Donald Trump in Wisconsin  by 9 points , for instance.  Of course, Joe Biden has his own lurking shadows.  Unlike Elizabeth Warren, who has developed her following based on her progressive appeal and solid debate performances, Biden's standing with the Democratic electorate seems largely driven by fear—fear of losing again to Donald Trump. If she can assuage that fear—or if another candidate can prove more viable—Joe Biden could be looking at a swift and total collapse. We've got a long way to go in this race, but the growing partisan divide around Donald Trump and the fear of losing to him in 2020 means electability will only grow in importance to Democratic primary voters. And that's bad news right now for every candidate whose name doesn't rhyme with Schmiden.   Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the 2020 election is 16 months away. "
"The media mob and their handlers in the Democratic Party are so desperate to smear the Trump administration that pretty much anything goes. Sean Hannity  thanked the ""media mob"" Friday, saying they've ""opened the door for a national discussion"" on former Vice President  Joe Biden 's alleged pressuring of Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to his son Hunter. ""Multiple reports now suggest that the so-called whistleblowers claim it surrounds the country of Ukraine,"" the Fox News host said on ""Hannity."" ""Now they're doing us a favor because they're now opening up a lot of questions we wanted to a cover for a long time. ""The boomerang comes right back on Biden, his family and the Democrats."" ""The boomerang comes right back on Biden, his family and the Democrats."" CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, President Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was  eventually released  after objections from the Senate. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. Biden said Friday that the claim has no credibility. Biden released a statement Friday criticizing Trump for the alleged phone call, demanding the president release a transcript and the whistleblower's complaint. WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM ""This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,"" the statement read. Hannity blasted the media for ignoring Biden's possible corruption. ""I didn't see anyone in the mob interested in that story but I do think the media mob, you have opened the door now for a national discussion about, well, what did Biden and his son do -- and when did they do it?""

""What did Biden and his son do -- and when did they do it?"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Earlier, the host dismissed the allegations against Trump, calling them just another example of Democrats and the media trying to impeach the president. ""This is what the mob does best -- hyperventilating at the remote possibility that this unknown information will somehow lead to the impeachment that they've been craving [since] the day after Election Day 2016,"" Hannity said. ""This is a psychotic rage."" Fox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report."
"Giuliani's comments came in a heated exchange on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" as Chris Cuomo pressed the former New York mayor over conversations he'd had  with a Ukrainian official  about Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who had investigated the former vice president's son, Hunter. Giuliani has repeatedly pointed to the event as a scandal, even as other Western governments also called for that prosecutor's dismissal and no evidence has indicated Biden's move was inappropriate. That prosecutor was replaced by Yuriy Lutsenko, who would later drop an investigation into a company in which Hunter Biden was involved. ""Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?"" Cuomo asked Giuliani. ""No, actually I didn't. I asked the Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016 by the Ukrainians for the benefit of Hillary Clinton, for which there is already a court finding,"" Giuliani responded.  ""You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden and his role with the prosecutor?"" Cuomo asked.  ""The only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that Lutsenko, who was appointed, dismissed the case,"" Giuliani said.  ""So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?"" Cuomo pressed. ""Of course I did,"" Giuliani said.  When asked about his contradicting answer, Giuliani said he ""didn't ask"" for Biden to be investigated specifically, but asked Ukraine ""to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme."" Giuliani's remarks come the same day  The Washington Post  and  The New York Times  reported that a recent whistleblower complaint about Trump making a ""promise"" to a foreign leader involves Ukraine.  As CNN previously reported , the complaint has led to a standoff between Congress and acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who has refused to turn over the complaint to the House Intelligence Committee."
"DES MOINES — Allegations that President Trump courted foreign interference from Ukraine to hurt his leading Democratic rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr., dominated presidential politics on Saturday, as Mr. Biden demanded a House investigation of Mr. Trump’s phone call   with Ukraine’s leader and as Mr. Trump lashed out, denying wrongdoing without releasing a transcript of the call. With Mr. Trump seizing on a familiar defense, saying Democrats were undertaking a “witch hunt” against him, Mr. Biden called on the House of Representatives to begin a new investigation of whether the president sought the interference of a foreign government to bolster his re-election campaign. “This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power,” Mr. Biden said during a campaign swing in Iowa. “We have never seen anything like this from any president.” Mr. Trump is said to have urged the Ukrainian president on a July 25 phone call to investigate Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who did business in Ukraine while his father was vice president. Mr. Trump’s request is part of a secret whistle-blower complaint in the intelligence community that is said to involve Mr. Trump making an unspecified commitment to a foreign leader, according to two people familiar with the complaint. The sharp accusations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden elevated the president’s dealings with Ukraine as a potentially significant new issue in the presidential race, and offered voters a preview of what is likely to be an extraordinary general election contest  if Mr. Biden were to win the nomination.  The controversy has focused on whether Mr. Trump manipulated foreign policy — a military aid package to Ukraine had been delayed at the time of the phone call — to pressure the country’s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to take action to damage Mr. Biden’s election bid. On Saturday, Mr. Trump sought to deflect attention from that question by accusing Mr. Biden of acting improperly as vice president in calling for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had overseen an inquiry into corruption related to the oligarch whose company employed Hunter Biden.  Mr. Trump  described his conversation with Mr. Zelensky as  “perfectly fine and routine. ” “Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He said that any effort to investigate him would fail, comparing it to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into his ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign. Intensifying a line of attack he and his allies have stoked for months, Mr. Trump said the real problem was Mr. Biden and questions about what the president described as “the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son.”  Referring to his conversation with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump said: “Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster.” No evidence  has surfaced to support Mr. Trump’s claim that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor general’s dismissal. But some State Department officials had expressed concern that Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine could complicate his father’s diplomacy there. The issue strikes a particular nerve for Mr. Biden, who has long feared putting his family under the harsh spotlight of a presidential campaign. During a two-minute encounter with reporters on Saturday morning, he grew irate, angrily insisting that he had never spoken with his son about any overseas work. “You should be looking at Trump,” Mr. Biden said. “Trump is doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum.” Even as they avoided mentioning Mr. Biden, other Democratic presidential candidates moved quickly to capitalize on the new dynamic in the race. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who rarely mentions Mr. Trump in her stump speech, opened her remarks at a cattle call on Saturday afternoon by excoriating both the president and congressional Democrats. “He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system,” she told a crowd of 1,200 cheering Democratic voters gathered in Des Moines for an afternoon of primary speeches. “It is time to call out this illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings right now.” Ms. Warren,  who first called for Mr. Trump to be impeached in April  after the release of Mr. Mueller’s report, went further on Friday, arguing on Twitter that by failing to act on impeachment,  Congress had become  “complicit in Trump’s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in U.S. elections.” Though he has yet to call for impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump — as have several of his rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination — Mr. Biden on Saturday tiptoed closer to embracing the  idea, which  has been gaining support on Capitol Hill despite opposition from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Mr. Biden, whose appearances on the campaign trail can be halting and sprinkled with misstatements, has generally delivered his  strongest performances  when focused on Mr. Trump. Speaking about the president allows Mr. Biden to discuss foreign policy and national security, issues that his campaign has said differentiate Mr. Biden, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, from the rest of the 2020 Democratic field. While  Mr. Trump’s attacks give Mr. Biden the one-on-one showdown with the president that his campaign has spent months trying to create, it also exposes him and his son to another round of questions about Hunter Biden’s business activities in Ukraine.  The Biden campaign moved quickly to warn the news media over the story, underscoring a deep concern about how allegations about the younger Mr. Biden’s work will be received by voters. “Any article, segment analysis and commentary that does not demonstrably state at the outset that there is no factual basis for Trump’s claim, and in fact that they are wholly discredited,  is misleading readers and viewers ,” said the deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, in an email to reporters. But Biden advisers also seized on the furor to portray Mr. Trump as fixated on, and worried about, a potential general election race against Mr. Biden.  “There is only one candidate the president is trying to get foreign governments to dig up bogus dirt on,” Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Mr. Biden, said. The   effort by the president and his team to shift the focus to Mr. Biden could boomerang, casting the Democratic front-runner as a sympathetic figure unfairly attacked with foreign help. It could just as easily mark a defining moment for Mr. Biden, a 76-year-old politician first elected to the Senate in 1972 and long accustomed to playing by the more genteel political rules of a different era. [ Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week? ] Donna Brazile, the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman who led the party through Hillary Clinton’s loss to Mr. Trump three years ago, said the exchange on Saturday “in many ways feels like 2016.” Just the prominent discussion of the actions of Mr. Biden and his son in Ukraine, regardless of the merits of the president’s accusations, has the potential to hurt Mr. Biden, Ms. Brazile said. “We’re basically creating a political  story, which right now is undermining Joe Biden , when I do believe the real focus should be getting the substance of the complaint out to the American people as soon as possible,” she said. On Saturday morning, Mr. Trump posted a video mash-up of TV news footage of stories about Mr. Biden’s son. “This is the real and only story,” the president wrote.  Citing the reports by journalists seemed contradictory given the president’s claim that the media had not reported on the issue. But the tweets signaled that Mr. Trump and his campaign organization would be doing as much as possible to sow doubt about Mr. Biden. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a Biden backer, said that no matter who emerges as the Democratic nominee in 2020, that person will face misinformation and slashing personal attacks by the president and his campaign. “You have any other nominee, Trump will do something comparable to try to disadvantage that nominee,” said Mr. Coons, as he walked with Mr. Biden into a Polk County Democratic Party event. “I don’t see anything about this story that is specific to Joe Biden.” So far, Mr. Biden’s rivals, nearly all of whom converged on Iowa this weekend, have been quick to assail Mr. Trump while avoiding commentary about how the president’s accusations against the Bidens would affect the Democratic nominating contest.  Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey , whose campaign manager on Friday released a memo stating he would have to drop out of the race if he failed to raise $1.7 million before the end of September, remarked that “this is not a partisan issue.” He and  former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas  reiterated their calls for Mr. Trump to be impeached. Even if Mr. Biden’s primary competitors don’t take direct aim, the perception of Mr. Biden’s son leveraging his connections cuts a stark contrast with two leading rivals, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders, who have centered their candidacies around a fierce populist message of rooting out corruption in Washington. It’s a message that worked in 2016 for Mr. Trump, who cast Ms. Clinton as the avatar of establishment self-dealing, a past-her-prime creature of Washington unable to adjust to the times and to produce real change. Mr. Biden’s team is acutely aware of that comparison. After Mr. Biden initially gave only a meager retort on the Ukraine issue Friday, his campaign decided to go further. Sensing an opportunity to highlight Mr. Trump’s fixation with Mr. Biden, his campaign released a statement in his name condemning the president for “abhorrent” conduct and demanding Mr. Trump release the transcript of his call with the Ukrainian leader and allow the director of national intelligence to release the whistle-blower’s claims to Congress. Advisers to Mr. Biden said his  initial reluctance  to comment reflected his prudence about discussing sensitive national security matters rather than unease with the work of his son in Ukraine.  But the former vice president is highly sensitive about questions regarding his family, and it was not until several outlets reported on what Mr. Trump said in the phone call last month that the Biden campaign determined it should try to go on the offensive.

"'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on why President Trump's handling of the latest showdown with Iran is drawing increased media criticism, especially from the likes of John Bolton and neocons. John Bolton had to know he was sending a message to the man who pushed him out of the White House. And a strong message it was, disagreeing with the president on just about every foreign policy hot spot. The recently departed national security adviser was speaking to a Manhattan luncheon for the Gatestone Institute, a conservative think tank he once chaired. About 60 people were gathered at Le Bernadin, including such hotshots as Alan Dershowitz, former attorney general Michael Mukasey and Newsmax chief Chris Ruddy. So the leak, in this case to Politico, was inevitable. The former Fox News contributor certainly gets that any words uttered before such a large audience will soon find their way into print. SIZE MATTERS? MEDIA PRAISE ELIZABETH WARREN -- AND HER CROWDS What’s fascinating here is that the Bolton broadside comes as Trump’s handling of the latest showdown with Iran is drawing increasing media criticism, especially from the right. The president is essentially in a no-win situation, whether he chooses a military strike against Iran or sticks with diplomacy and sanctions. The neocon wing of the GOP wants him to retaliate for the attack on Saudi oil facilities that our intel agencies are blaming on Iran, and is casting his reluctance as a sign of weakness. Bolton told the luncheon that any negotiations were Iran (and North Korea) are “doomed to failure,”  according to Politico. “Bolton also said more than once that Trump’s failure to respond to the Iranian attack on an American drone earlier this summer set the stage for the Islamic Republic’s aggression in recent months…Bolton said the planned response had gone through the full process and everybody in the White House had agreed on the retaliatory strike. But ‘a high authority, at the very last minute,’ without telling anyone, decided not to do it.” Reporters quickly asked Trump for his response. “John was not able to work with anybody, and a lot of people disagreed with his ideas,” he said. “A lot of people were very critical that I brought him on in the first place because of the fact that he was so in favor of going into the Middle East, and he got stuck in quicksand and we became policemen for the Middle East. It’s ridiculous.” SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES The president was referring to the Iraq war and Bolton’s role in the Bush administration. Trump ran against that war, and endless wars, and obviously wants to get out of Afghanistan. The neocons are growing more critical of Trump’s reluctance to pull the trigger in these situations. He even got into a little spat with his pal Lindsey Graham, who said, like Bolton, that the president’s failure to strike back after Iran downed an American drone is what paved the way for the attack that cut Saudi oil production in half. The Beltway press, as part of an establishment whose kids are rarely sent off to fight, often reflects these pro-war instincts. Iraq, you’ll recall, was going to be a cakewalk. Bret Stephens, a conservative  New York Times  columnist who detests the president, wrote yesterday that Trump’s policy is “locked, half-cocked, and probably bluffing.” He said this president combines “the rhetorical impulses of Bob Dornan with the strategic instincts of Dennis Kucinich.” Trump does like to talk tough with foreign adversaries. And obviously he has ordered airstrikes before. But it’s no accident that he threatened to incinerate North Korea and wound up in a pen pal relationship with Kim Jong-un. And yet if he keeps turning to sanctions and diplomacy, does there come a point where he looks like Barack Obama and his Syrian red line? Trump is bound to disappoint the neocons by exercising restraint when it comes to military options, knowing full well that there are unintended consequences that could bog down U.S. troops for years to come. That means he’s likely to face continued criticism from John Bolton, but might be in tune with the war-weary portion of the country."
"For just one September week each year, everyone from kings, presidents and prime ministers on down to food tasters fly in to New York City and jam into the United Nations headquarters, in what has become a cliched joke about "" diplomatic speed dating ."" But there's nothing funny about the top priority at this 74th year of UNGA year, which is  the world's climate emergency. The United Nations Climate Summit  The UN has arranged  a special Climate Action summit  on Monday September 23, before the formal speeches given by heads of state and governments that normally draw the most attention. Breaking with tradition,  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres  has told country leaders not to come to the podium Monday without ""concrete and transformative plans"" to halt rising global temperatures, achieve carbon neutrality and cut carbon emissions by 45 percent. VIPs with proposals have been told they have just three minutes to speak. How concrete the results of the summit will actually be is unclear. The UN doesn't have a global climate army to roam the planet stopping pollution, so it's up to the 193 nations of the UN to take action. What the UN will actually do is what some feel the organization sadly does best: collecting the speeches and other environmental brainstorms in a report. The aim is to pressure world leaders to do more, as the climate emergency worsens. Some have made it a top priority -- German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  will be in town for the climate summit, even though she's skipping the rest of the week. In contrast, US President Donald Trump will be in town, but he's skipping the climate summit -- instead  hosting a session on religious persecution  in the same building. Trump has previously avoided international meetings on climate.  Let the General Debate begin The so-called ""general debate"" begins on Tuesday September 24, and the first country to speak is Brazil, by longstanding tradition. It'll be the debut UNGA appearance of Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro, who recently vowed to attend even if in a wheelchair, following recent surgery. Expect fireworks: After high global concern over  massive fires and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon , the  pro-business Bolsonaro  is likely to take climate advocates head-on. He has already promised a ""speech that is different from those that came before"". Following him will be Donald Trump, who has stuck to the teleprompter previously, and last year  drew laughter from delegates  while praising his own administration.  The volume of Trump's appearances and his unpredictability have dominated the past two years of Trump at the General Assembly. Last year, he shocked the visiting Chinese Foreign Minister  by accusing Beijing of interfering in US elections  while both men sat at the Security Council table.  Trump was also the first US President to enter the building and take just a few steps before stopping in front of cameras and shouting reporters, to answer hot topic questions for three days. ""He completely sucked the oxygen out of UNGA,"" Richard Gowan, UN Director at the International Crisis Center says. The elephant in the secretariat This year,  a mysterious attack on Saudi oil fields  has provided some late drama to UNGA, as US officials point the finger at Iran, despite  its denials  and  claims of responsibility by Houthi rebels  in Yemen. The US, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and other Middle East players will all be under one roof for days. Some can't stray too far. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has been slapped by movement restrictions from the US, which confine him to a small zone near the UN headquarters. A senior UN official stated, ""tensions in the Gulf are going to be the backdrop to a lot of events and meetings."" Which leads us to the biggest question on the eve of UNGA: Will President Trump meet Iranian President Rouhani? ‎Nothing is planned between the two leaders, though both will be in the UN building amid the parade of delegations. The threats and rhetoric lobbed by both sides have been fierce. The US imposed more sanctions on Iran on Friday before the high-level week begins, and the Iranians say they don't need to talk. It looks like ""a zero chance for a meeting,"" says Gowan. ""Instead of a diplomatic breakthrough, we're likely to see a war of words."" The UN is meant to be a neutral ground for dueling sides to have dialogue, and chance face-to-face encounters are exactly what this international forum is good for. In 2000, then-US President Clinton and then Cuban President Fidel Castro suddenly stopped briefly for each other in a hallway, when relations between the nations were running cold. There is  still a debate whether a handshake took place . Who's coming to UNGA?  As of Friday, 91 heads of state had committed to attend. French President Macron will be in New York offering an expanded French leadership role as a global mediator, as the Trump administration pulls the US back from international forums. ‎With  significant angst at home  over the UK's planned withdrawal from Europe, Boris Johnson will make his first UNGA appearance in his role as prime minister. Brexit talks are scheduled with Ireland's leader and others. And Indian leader Narendra Modi and Pakistan's leader Imran Khan are both attending and speaking in the General Assembly. No talks are scheduled between them for now, as tensions remain high over  India's treatment of Kashmir,  a disputed territory. And of fresh interest to American audiences will be Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who debuts at UNGA right in the middle of a growing controversy: The US Congress wants to know if  Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden's son , who had business ties in the country. Biden, of course, is one of the main contenders for the US Democratic primary and could end up challenging Trump for the presidency next year. There are also UN meetings big and small on Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, and Myanmar. Apart from marathon hours of speeches, consider this: 630 meetings have been requested. The UN defines a meeting as a gathering of 15 or more people held within the UN for a maximum of three hours. There are ""no less challenges than last year"" affecting geopolitics around the world, said British UN Ambassador Karen Pierce. Expect demonstrators near the UN all day -- though the targets of their anger may not even see them through their tinted limousine windows as they rush to the UN, sirens sometimes wailing. The list of leaders who will not appear this year is also interesting: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping rarely attend, and will not be present this year. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu has canceled,  amid a post-election muddle  back home. Netanyahu, a former UN Ambassador, relishes his General Assembly speeches -- often with props of charts and diagrams -- and he has previously made for must-see TV in between lengthy boring speeches by others.  Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had been listed as a speaker, but is no longer coming in the wake of  multiple revelations of black- and brownface photos  that surfaced from his past, just before national elections. President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela has sent his regards but will not leave his turmoil-filled nation. His rival for the Venezuelan presidency -- National Assembly leader Juan Guaido, whose presidential authority has been acknowledged by more than 50 countries, including the US -- is unlikely to show but representatives will push the UN for future recognition of Guaido's claim to power. Although the immediate premises of the United Nations are international ground, the United States is still the host. According to the ""host country"" agreement, visitors traveling for official UN business are not supposed to be barred, and there was once a time when the US would impose a generous 25-mile radius cordon on international visitors it didn't like. But this year, the US is not holding back. In addition to the movement restrictions on Iran's Zarif, two Cuban diplomats living in New York who had planned to participate in UNGA were ordered expelled by the Trump administration, in a surprise Thursday announcement. And the remaining diplomats at the Cuban mission face the toughest restrictions among all countries: They're not allowed to leave the narrow island of Manhattan. And with all the traffic and security blockades, New Yorkers and tourists ‎too may feel no one can get off the island during this madhouse week."

"The Steak Fry marks just the latest event in the  first-in-the-nation caucus state  where candidates will pitch themselves as the best contender to take on President Donald Trump.  With less than five months to go until the February 3, 2020, caucuses, candidates are putting an increased focus on the state -- and dusting off some dance moves -- in hopes Iowa voters will bolster their campaigns in a crowded Democratic primary field.  Sen. Kamala Harris of California,  who is looking to reframe her stagnating campaign by setting high expectations in Iowa , made her Steak Fry entrance alongside a marching drumline: Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who captured 2% support in Iowa in a September  CBS/YouGov Iowa poll , put on a similarly energetic display: And while Klobuchar has hit Trump's policies as ""all foam, no beer"" on the campaign trial, she said her beer on Saturday was just the opposite.  ""All beer, no foam,"" she said, beverage in hand.  Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro put less emphasis on his own moves and more focus on the mariachi band that accompanied his entrance.  ""Brought our own flavor to the #SteakFry,"" he tweeted Saturday."
"Now Ukraine has become wrapped in the Trump presidency's many subplots: the role of Russia and President Vladimir Putin, the legacy of Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, Trump's reelection outlook and a loose network of advisers not always operating in concert. The result is renewed focus on a country Trump once sought to tune out but where he now sees a political opportunity. His approach to Ukraine melds political and national security concerns fanned by some of his closest advisers. Trump has raised the issue involving the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden repeatedly in private conversations and believes there is a political opportunity in further probing the matter, the people familiar with the matter said. He's been urged along by his private attorney,  Rudy Giuliani, who told CNN on Thursday evening  that he'd pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son. Giuliani has maintained that he has been acting on his own and not at the direction of the President as he meets with Ukrainian officials. But Giuliani is aware that the issue has gotten Trump's attention, according to the people familiar with the situation. And Trump has raised it multiple times, in person and on the phone.  A source close to the White House who is familiar with Trump's comments said the President has been seething for months about Ukraine and Biden. The source described Trump as ""angry"" about what he sees as a liability for the former vice president. The source also said Giuliani has been ""egging him on."" Trump told reporters on Friday that ""somebody ought to look into"" the Biden matter, and said that ""it doesn't matter what I discussed"" during a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. CNN reported on Friday that in that call,  Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden's son . Trump is due to meet next Wednesday with Zelensky in New York. Trump was not initially interested in meeting with Zelensky or engaging with him, viewing him as an extension of the country's previous leader, President Petro Poroshenko. Trump believed Ukraine was a corrupt country that wasn't committed to reform, according to people familiar with his thinking at the time. The phone call and meeting come after months of back and forth between Trump and his advisers, who have worked to convince him that engaging the new Ukrainian leader is worth his time and effort for national security reasons. The country's attacks on Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, with accusations of him laundering money with offshore accounts, were the ultimate foundation for the President's beliefs.  Trump also consistently cast Ukraine -- a portion of which was annexed by Russia in 2014 -- as a messy situation created by his predecessor that he was unenthusiastic about wading into himself. ""He had never been concerned or interested in Ukraine,"" one person familiar with Trump's thinking said.  ""Obama lost it,"" was Trump's view, the person said, adding that the President always seemed ""more interested in engaging Putin than Zelensky.""  Trump's ties to Putin have been heavily scrutinized, and he's been accused of showing deference to the Russian leader. He's also remained fixated on Obama, frequently seeking to unravel his legacy. That lack of interest in Ukraine appeared to shift over the summer, when some of Trump's national security advisers worked to convince him that engaging Ukraine's new leader would benefit US national security interests. Though Trump continued to remain skeptical, he told his advisers he was open to being convinced of further engagement.  Then-national security adviser John Bolton and other senior Trump administration officials invited Oleksandr Danylyuk, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, to Washington for meetings in early July. They went well, and the White House saw it as a ""sign of encouragement"" to nudge Trump toward working with Ukraine.  The renewed engagement happened to dovetail with Giuliani's efforts to convince Ukrainian officials to look into Biden and his son -- an effort Giuliani spoke about publicly and that quickly caught Trump's attention. Even before Zelensky took office, Giuliani made known he was looking to set up a meeting to discuss an investigation into Burisma, the natural gas company where Biden's son Hunter had served on the board of directors. Giuliani's meetings occurred over the summer, just as US administration officials were working to spark Trump's interest in Ukraine. The parallel efforts seemed to be the launchpad for convincing Trump to engage with Ukraine more robustly. Three weeks later, Trump spoke by phone with Zelensky for the first time, in a call that is now under intense scrutiny for its potential role in the  whistleblower's complaint . Later, aides worked to arrange a meeting in Poland, though Trump ultimately did not make the trip because of a hurricane in the United States. People familiar with the matter said Bolton and the other US officials who met with Danylyuk in early July did not discuss the Biden matter. But the issue was known, and colored the talks. ""That was a bizarre situation, but it all seemed to be dealt with in Giuliani track,"" a person familiar with the meetings said. ""It was out there, but it was being handled by Giuliani. We did not deal with that because he [Giuliani] was talking about it and saying he was a private citizen."" At the same time, the administration begin reviewing $250 million in foreign aid to Ukraine, initially placing a hold on the package that angered some in Congress. The issue provided another wedge between Bolton, who was an advocate for the aid, and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who pushed for the package to be reviewed.  The money was released last week . It's not known how, if at all, the foreign aid was related to the Biden matter. And a person familiar with the situation said Friday that Trump had not discussed the pending aid package during the July 25 call with Zelensky. But even before this week's revelations about the intelligence whistleblower, Democrats in Congress had accused the administration of engaging in a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government. Through it all, Trump's interactions and meetings on Ukraine have been treated with special sensitivity within the administration. The State Department never got extensive readouts of his calls. And few people within the administration learned precisely what was discussed. ""There was concern about leaks,"" one person said of the tight hold on information."
"WASHINGTON — Bernie Sanders has long wanted to remake the health care system so no one will have to pay directly for medical care again. Now, he also wants to go back and cancel all the medical debts of people who have been billed under the current system. In a plan released Saturday, Mr. Sanders,  the Vermont senator and presidential candidate , proposes  wiping out  an estimated $81 billion in existing debt and changing rules around debt collection and bankruptcy. He also calls for replacing the giant credit reporting agencies with a “public credit registry” that would ignore medical debt when calculating credit scores. The proposals reflect Mr. Sanders’s concern that the medical system has placed financial hardships on too many Americans, by discouraging them from seeking needed medical care — but also by saddling them with expensive and unfair bills that can harm their financial security, ding their credit and, in some cases, lead to bankruptcy.  The plan  is Mr. Sanders’s latest effort to transform the health care system in America, a goal on which he has staked not just his second presidential run, but much of his political legacy. His proposal also separates him from other  presidential candidates : While several of them have come to embrace his “Medicare for all” plan to create a government-run health insurance system, he is the first top-tier contender to call for such drastic measures on medical debt.  “We’re addressing it on both ends,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re addressing it now by trying to help the people who have past due medical bills. And we’re addressing it by finally creating a health care system that guarantees coverage to people without any premiums, without any deductibles, without any out-of-pocket expenses.” [ Sign up for our politics newsletter  and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Medical debt affects Americans who lack health insurance, of course. But it is also  increasingly affecting people who have insurance  with holes, like high deductibles or  limited networks  of doctors whose care is paid for.  Around 16 percent of adults with credit reports have at least one medical debt,  according to  a study  published last year in the journal Health Affairs. The plan calls for the government to negotiate and cancel the debts, though it does not specify the precise mechanism. While eliminating every American’s medical debt would probably not come cheap, Mr. Sanders’s plan could wind up costing far less than the total amount of debt he is seeking to cancel. Craig Antico, a founder of the charity RIP Medical Debt, which buys and forgives medical debt,  estimated that the market price for $81 billion in debt could be as low as $500 million . Most past-due medical debt never gets paid, which is why bill collectors are often willing to sell the debts for pennies on the dollar. The plan would also create a public credit rating agency to “replace” for-profit companies like Equifax, and it would exclude medical debts from credit ratings. It would establish a new legal process, managed by the bankruptcy court system, to help adjudicate medical debts that are not yet in collections. Studies suggest that medical debts can be less damaging to people’s credit than other kinds of debt, in part because the credit reporting agencies treat people’s ability to pay medical bills as less predictive of creditworthiness than, say, their ability to pay credit card bills or car payments. And, despite the news media’s focus on particularly large medical bills, the typical bill in collections is less than $600, according to the Health Affairs article. But medical debts do affect credit somewhat, and they can cause psychological stress, beyond the financial consequences. A  survey  of people with medical debts  conducted by The New York Times  and the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2016 found that 44 percent of adults under 65 who had problems paying medical bills said those bills had a “major effect” on their lives. Fear of medical debts causes some people to avoid needed medical care. And medical bills can affect other parts of people’s finances that are harder to measure, showing up as an unpaid credit card bill or a missed loan payment. “I have a belief that if a plan like this could eliminate the debt that’s causing hardship, it could make a huge difference in people’s lives,” Mr. Antico said. The Sanders campaign circulated statistics suggesting that more than 500,000 Americans declare bankruptcy each year because of medical bills. That number, derived from  a survey of bankrupt individuals , overstates the impact of medical bills on bankruptcy. The study itself noted that health problems can cause bankruptcies in two ways, through direct medical bills and through lost income due to illness itself. The 500,000 figure includes both groups.  Other research has shown that  income losses due to illness are often the bigger financial hit than medical bills . Neither Mr. Sanders’s “Medicare for all” plan nor his medical debt program would address that secondary issue, though he has also called for guaranteeing workers paid medical leave.   The plan “is well targeted,” said Neale Mahoney, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, who studies medical debt. “It just may not be that much relief.” [ Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week? ] Mr. Sanders said that, in conversations with people around the country, he had come to see medical debt as the most consistent and visceral manifestation of a broken health care system.  At an event this month in Carson City, Nev., for instance, he heard  from a veteran  who said he had $139,000 in medical debt. When Mr. Sanders asked the man how he would pay off the debt, the man responded: “I can’t. I can’t. I’m going to kill myself.”  Those kinds of deeply moving moments, he said, drove him to seek a new way to ameliorate that particular pain as part of his overall vision for changing the health care system.  “I have always believed that health care is a human right, and it has always disturbed me immensely that so many of our people are uninsured or underinsured and can’t go to the doctor,” Mr. Sanders said. “But I have learned in this campaign something else, which I didn’t talk about previously, and that is the financial pain that this dysfunctional health care system is causing people.” The new plan is part of a burst of policy-related activity from the Sanders campaign, which also released  a housing plan last week  that included a proposal to establish a  national rent control standard . Margot Sanger-Katz reported from Washington, and Sydney Ember from New York."
"As with so much in the Trump presidency, it all starts with Hillary Clinton. Here's what we know: Giuliani's accusation Rudy Giuliani, the President's attorney and political attack dog, said on CNN Thursday night that his ongoing efforts to  pursue Clinton took him to Ukraine . First he alleged, without evidence, that she and Democrats were behind the effort to discredit Paul Manafort, who is currently in prison for, among other things, laundering money he was paid as a political consultant in Ukraine. Then things turned away from Clinton. ""In the course of investigating that, I found out this incredible story about Joe Biden, that he bribed the President of the Ukraine in order to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,"" said Giuliani, alleging a media coverup. ""That is an astounding scandal of major proportions, which all of you have covered up for five or six months."" From there the interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo went completely off the rails and Giuliani eventually admitted he had asked the current Ukrainian government to look into Biden. ""Of course I did!"" he said. But the President's attorney trying to get action from Ukraine is one thing. It would be something different entirely if the administration used official leverage to get a foreign country to investigate a US political rival, especially just months after special counsel Robert Mueller detailed multiple interactions between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia but found nothing rising to the level of coordination between campaign associates and officials and Russian governmental officials. Trump spoke with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 and that phone call may be part of what led to the complaint against Trump. Asked Friday about that July 25 call and whether he mentioned Biden to the Ukrainian President,  Trump tried to deflect back to Biden . ""It doesn't matter what I discuss,"" he said. ""But I will say this: Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case."" On Friday afternoon, the Wall Street Journal reported that on that phone call Trump pressured the new president ""about eight times"" to work with Giuliani on Biden, citing people familiar with the matter. Vice President Mike Pence recently met with Zelensky and was asked about Giuliani's efforts and whether the administration has held up aid to Ukraine as a result. REPORTER: Specifically, number one, did you discuss Joe Biden at all during that meeting yesterday with the Ukrainian President?  And number two, can you assure Ukraine that the hold-up of that money has absolutely nothing to do with efforts, including by Rudy Giuliani, to try to dig up dirt on the Biden family? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE:  Well, on the first question, the answer is no.  But we — with President Zelensky yesterday, we discussed — we discussed America's support for Ukraine and the upcoming decision the President will make on the latest tranche of financial support in great detail. Ukraine uses the aid in its efforts against Russian separatists, part of a long-term conflict with Russia. Biden's efforts in Ukraine Despite Giuliani's allegation, there has been no media coverup of the allegations against Biden.  The New York Times wrote about Biden's son  and his activities back in May and made clear that Trump's allies were pushing it. The President tweeted about it at the time. Since then, Trump, Giuliani and others have come back to the story repeatedly. Asked about Trump's statement Friday, Biden said ""Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion."" ""Not one single one, and so I have no comment except the President should start to be (the) President,"" Biden said. The crux of Giuliani's allegation is that Joe Biden tried to have Ukraine's top prosecutor ousted in 2016 because of an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. At the time, Hunter Biden was serving on Burisma's board. But the reality is much more nuanced. It is absolutely true that at the same time Burisma was being investigated, western governments, including the Obama administration wanted the prosecutor removed due to concerns about corruption in his own office. Biden too opposed  the prosecutor in Ukraine, Viktor Shokin, and threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine. He's actually bragged about it. Recounting a trip he made to Kiev in 2016, he said it showed the US was able to get Ukraine to take corruption more seriously. ""I looked at them and said: I'm leaving in six hours,"" Biden  said during an event at the Council of Foreign Relations in 2018 . ""If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" None of this is a particularly good look for the Bidens, but there's no proof or suggestion of any actual wrongdoing. At least one former official in the prosecutor's office said the investigation into Burisma had already been shelved by the time Joe Biden was threatening to withhold financial aid unless Ukraine replaced its top prosecutor. It's also not clear if Hunter Biden was a focus of that investigation when it was occurring. In an interview on May 14 posted on Facebook by his assistant, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yury Lutsenko said Burisma paid an entity connected to Hunter Biden ""millions,"" but added, ""from my point of view, a board member can be paid whatever a company decides ... they didn't violate any Ukrainian laws.""  He said that he said it was a matter for US law to consider, not Ukrainian investigators. Lutsenko in May said he was looking to ""reanimate"" an investigation of Burisma, Hunter Biden's former employer -- but that apparently never happened. Lutsenko left office in August after the new administration of Zelensky took office. Giuliani himself went to meet with a representative of Zelensky after the President's call with Trump in July. According to Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Ukrainian officials understand there is a link between what Giuliani was asking of the Ukrainians to do and getting US military aid. Murphy met with the Ukrainian President a few weeks ago and described the scene on Twitter. ""Zelensky did not explicitly connect the two in our meeting, but he was VERY concerned about the cut off of aid, and VERY aware of the conversations that Rudy Giuliani was having with his team. I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump's campaign operatives. He agreed,"" Murphy explained in a series of tweets.   Trump's playbook Fostering conspiracy theories about his rival was a strategy that worked for Trump in 2016 as he used decades of conservative conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton to label her ""crooked"" and suggest she should be in jail rather than the White House. Biden, however, is not followed by the same political taint as the Clintons and the effort by Trump and his allies may now have led to a whistleblower sounding the alarm under a law meant to protect intelligence officials for uncovering improper activity. The specifics of the whistleblower complaint remain a mystery and could remain that way as Trump's new acting Director of National Intelligence refuses to share information about the complaint with Congress. The Intelligence Community Inspector General has caused alarm by publicly saying he is being kept from doing his job. Father and son Hunter Biden's personal life and substance abuse issues have already caused angst for the former vice president. The overlap between the father and son's political and business interests have fueled GOP attacks that Biden is little more than a self-interested politician. Whether the facts fully support that case appears to be an afterthought for his critics. GOP researchers have been digging through Hunter Biden's career history as well as the points where it appears to intersect with his father's, particularly where it pertains to Ukraine and China, another topic Giuliani brought up during his interview with Cuomo."
"The affair, centering on Trump's contacts with a leader of a mystery foreign nation -- identified in two reports as Ukraine -- has also injected a toxic element into relations among the President, the intelligence community and Congress. It is hard to see how any of this ends well. Six months after special counsel Robert Mueller shut up shop, the White House again faces suspicion over Trump's dealings with a foreign power and seems to be taking steps to stop the full story from coming out. Democrats are rummaging for new skeletons in Trump's closet and yet another showdown is developing between the executive and Congress that appears almost certain to play out in the courts. The details of the controversy unleashed  when a whistleblower sounded the alarm  about the President are complex, disputed according to political allegiance and largely not public. The Washington Post  and  The New York Times  reported Thursday that the contacts at issue between Trump and the foreign leader involve Ukraine. In the past, some of Trump's supporters, including his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, have urged the Kiev government to open investigations that the President could use to raise suspicions about his political rivals, including Joe Biden. In a  heated exchange with CNN's Chris Cuomo  on Thursday night, Giuliani denied asking Ukraine to investigate the former vice president, before admitting he had done just that. The US and Ukraine were in discussions about $250 million in military aid to Kiev this summer that had been delayed by the White House. Giuliani said he didn't know anything about the package, but that if Trump had used it as leverage to benefit himself politically in any way he would not have done anything wrong.  ""The reality is that the President of the United States, whoever he is, has every right to tell the president of another country you better straighten out the corruption in your country if you want me to give you a lot of money. If you're so damn corrupt that you can't investigate allegations -- our money is going to get squandered,"" Giuliani said.  T rump attempted to discredit the whistleblower as ""highly partisan"" in a series of tweets Friday morning, echoing remarks made by Giuliani on Thursday night. The President said his comments to ""a certain foreign leader"" were ""pitch perfect."" Trump tweeted: ""Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!"" Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. There is so far no public evidence that the whistleblower's complaint pertains to this conversation or that there was any abuse of power by Trump. The White House later lifted the hold on aid.  But the potential ramifications of this new storm are already becoming clear and the risks facing the President, the intelligence community and Democrats in Congress are climbing by the day. Disturbing possibilities There must at least be a possibility that Trump abused his power or committed a grievous ethical lapse in dealing with the foreign leader. His defense was not exactly reassuring, considering some of the wild comments the President has made in the company of rogue counterparts such as Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un. ""Is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call?"" Trump tweeted on Thursday. CNN reported Thursday  that the intelligence community inspector general suggested to the House Intelligence Committee that the complaint raised concerns about multiple actions. He would not say whether those instances involved   Trump, sources familiar with the closed-door briefing told CNN. The inspector general, Michael Atkinson, was legally unable to discuss the complaint itself, since Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has declined to hand it over. Democrats say he is compelled to provide the complaint under whistleblower legislation, and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said his committee may take legal action if it isn't turned over. The Washington Post on Wednesday  said the complaint referenced a ""promise"" Trump allegedly made to the unidentified leader. CNN has not confirmed that aspect of the controversy. The whistleblower didn't have direct knowledge of the communications, an official briefed on the matter told CNN. Instead, the whistleblower's concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration's determination that the complaint didn't fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said. It is hard to know the potential exposure faced by the President. But given the sensitivity of the issue, the complaint is likely to have come from an official familiar with the scope of presidential power. And it was signed off as ""urgent and credible"" by the inspector general -- a Trump appointee -- who thought Congress should know in line with whistleblowing laws. The implication of such a fact pattern is staggering and opens up the potential of serious misconduct inside the White House -- despite Trump's denials of any wrongdoing. A President maligned?  If, on the other hand, the alleged behavior by the President does not reach such a bar, the political fallout will be considerable. Trump, acting within his wide Article Two constitutional powers, may have been maligned and there will be accusations that the whistleblower -- though moving within the scope of the law -- will have overreached. The President's suspicion of the intelligence community, which he sees as a ""Deep State"" bent on overthrowing him, will grow. If a president cannot trust his own spies, and thinks they are working against him and not the country's enemies, then America's national security will be harmed. The President's allies are already arguing that the controversy is simply another ruse by House Democrats to damage Trump. ""He has very wide authority, really unchecked authority, to talk to world leaders about anything he deems appropriate as he is representing the United States of America,"" said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union.""If this were able to go forward, any staffer in an agency could constantly hobble a Democratic President, duly elected."" ""This is an unconstitutional argument,"" Schlapp said on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Of course, the White House could clear all this up by explaining the contents of the alleged contacts between the President and the foreign leader. But it is taking the opposite tack. According to three CNN sources , the White House and the Justice Department advised the director of national intelligence that the complaint isn't governed by laws covering intelligence whistleblowers. The revelation is the first known evidence of the White House's involvement in the standoff. There may be an argument that the content of the President's communications or an official's impressions of them sent to Congress are subject to executive privilege. But the administration's resistance to scrutiny is already fueling suspicions of a cover-up. And it throws new light on the role of Attorney General William Barr -- who has been accused by critics of shaping special counsel Robert Mueller's damning revelations to the President's advantage. Barr, who served in the same role for President George H.W. Bush, advocates a theory of expansive presidential power, one reason why he has become perhaps Trump's favorite Cabinet member. Whistleblowers exposed House Democrats argue that the White House is yet again adopting a model of presidential power that threatens to tear the checks and balances of the US system to shreds. Schiff effectively argued that the approach taken by the administration could lead to the quashing of whistleblower claims in the government. That could lead down a road of power without accountability and in theory impunity for any presidential wrongdoing. ""The impact of this opinion is that if the Department of Justice decides that any employee of the intelligence committee comes forward, follows the law, follows the process, is nonetheless outside the process, they're not protected,"" the California Democrat said. ""Which not only means this whistleblower is not protected, it means no whistleblower is protected. That is the danger of the DOJ's misinterpretation of the law."" The fresh confrontation between the White House and the Congress is certain to fuel the frustration of Democrats at the White House's efforts to evade scrutiny. And it will add momentum to claims of many grass roots liberals and a growing corps of House Democrats who do not share House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reluctance to proceed with impeachment."
"Trump, while speaking with reporters before departing the White House for events in Texas and Ohio, continued to defend his July 25 call with  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , but said the 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate was discussed in the exchange. ""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption),"" Trump told reporters. CNN previously reported Trump pressed Zelensky   in the call to investigate  former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according  to a person familiar with the situation .  That call was also part of a  whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump previously branded criticism of the call a ""Ukranian Witch Hunt,"" while Biden accused the President of abusing his power to ""smear"" him. On Sunday, the President said he hopes officials release details of the call, but slammed the whistleblower responsible for filing a complaint. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a strong warning later Sunday to the Trump administration, which has refused to hand over the whistleblower complaint, saying it ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness"" if the resistance persists. The warning, shared in a letter to all House members, comes following a  refusal last week  by acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to turn over the complaint to Congress. In her letter, Pelosi, a California Democrat, said if the administration's refusals continue, it would constitute a ""serious possible breach of constitutional duties by"" Trump and would take Congress ""into a whole new stage of investigation.""  Pelosi set a deadline for Maguire to turn over the full whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee during  his scheduled appearance  Thursday. The Democratic leader's letter threatens investigation at a time when the White House is  already facing House inquiries on multiple fronts  and a continuing  impeachment investigation  by the House Judiciary Committee. The Trump administration has so far split on how to handle the details of the call, but any House-led investigation into the President's Ukraine contact could meet significant resistance from the White House, as it has stonewalled many of the congressional probes already in motion. Pressure to impeach Weighing in on the controversy earlier Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that impeachment ""may be the only remedy"" to Trump's refusal to make public the  complaint  and phone call transcript. ""If the President is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,"" the California Democrat told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" stopping short of  calling on Congress to immediately launch  proceedings. Schiff, who has  so far resisted joining other Democrats  in calling for impeachment, told Tapper he has been ""very reluctant"" to push for proceedings against the President because he sees it as a ""remedy of last resort,"" but also said Sunday that the President doesn't have the authority ""to engage in underhanded discussions."" The chairman's apparent edging toward impeachment follows pressure from others in his party -- including from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- to start proceedings. On Friday, Warren, who is vying for her party's presidential nomination, tweeted that ""Congress is complicit"" in failing to start impeachment proceedings against Trump after news broke that he had allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. Echoing Warren's sentiments, Ocasio-Cortez suggested in a tweet on Saturday that her party's ""refusal to impeach"" Trump was an even bigger scandal than what she said was the President's ""lawbreaking behavior."" Asked by Tapper Sunday about Trump keeping conversations with foreign leaders private, Schiff said: ""Well not if those conversations involve potential corruption or criminality or leverage being used for political advantage against our nation's interest.""  ""This would be, I think, the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during just about any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions,"" he said, adding that he's not certain that the call is the subject of the complaint.  White House split on releasing calls  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told reporters on Saturday that he didn't think Trump had tried pressuring Zelensky during the July call, but stopped short of saying the subject of Biden's son wasn't raised. The President on Sunday described his conversation with the Ukrainian president as ""warm and friendly"" and repeatedly urged reporters to look instead at Biden and Democrats, who he said -- without providing evidence -- have ""done some very bad things."" But while the President suggested he was open to releasing the conversation, telling reporters: ""I hope they can put it out,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there's no evidence such an action ""would be appropriate"" at this time. ""We don't release transcripts very often. It's the rare case,"" Pompeo said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn't be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances. There's no, there's no evidence that would be appropriate here at this point."" Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin also weighed in, telling Tapper Sunday that he thinks releasing the transcript ""would be a terrible precedent,"" arguing that ""conversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential.""  This story has been updated."

The historian Alfred McCoy  wrote recently in The Nation   that “ instead of reducing  the traffic, the drug war has actually helped stimulate that ninefold increase in global opium production and a parallel surge in U.S. heroin users, from just 68,000 in 1970 to 886,000 in 2017.”  Drug deaths  reached  192 a day  in 2017, with many of them between the ages of 12 and 25.  That  is a silent Parkland … every day. What is your solution to this catastrophe? Bill Williams New York To the Editor: One  egregious omission to date from the Democratic debates is the future of  Social Security,  which according to recent projections will face a  critical funding shortfall  by 2034. This threatens the well-being of millions of Americans. Efforts to discredit and undermine the program, whether through benefit cuts or privatization, will ultimately erode the nation’s entire social welfare system. Individuals earning under $50,000 a year receive 90 percent of Social Security benefits. Nearly half of all racial minority retirees rely on them for all or nearly all of their  income .

Matt Carbone Valhalla, N.Y. The writer is an accountant.  To the Editor: There has yet to be any meaningful debate discussion of  the judiciary . The president has appointed over  150 judges  (and counting), including two Supreme Court justices, one of whom remains controversial a year after his appointment. I would like to hear questions about what the candidates would be looking for in their judicial appointments and also what they plan to do when their plans are inevitably derailed by judges appointed by this president. It may also be time to open a discussion of changes to the judiciary, such as term limits for judges. Should someone who is president for only four (or even eight) years really be able to reshape the judiciary for 40 years?  The Republicans are highly successful at getting their voters to the polls with promises of judicial appointments. It is beyond time for the Democrats to stress the importance of judicial appointments to their voters. If the president is re-elected, he will undoubtedly get at least one more Supreme Court appointment, and the consequences for the country would be dire. Judy Gitlin Valley Cottage, N.Y. To the Editor: I  offer the candidates not an issue to discuss but a plea to include in their discussion what has been absent:  the hope and promise of America . The candidates, rightly enough but relentlessly and angrily, point to what we do wrong, to our endless faults, our systemic racism, sexual harassment, cruel capitalism, economic injustices and widespread discrimination. Recall Ronald Reagan’s  “Morning in America”  ad. However shallow it may have sounded, and however much mocked, it resonated deeply, and we recall it even today.  Perhaps candidates should take a hint. Perhaps point to a vision, however imperfectly realized so far, of a country where liberty and justice are part of its promise and its future, a country for which so many sacrificed. Perhaps draw inspiration if not from Reagan then from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose message always remained one of hope, of a dream.  Mel A. Topf Providence, R.I.  To the Editor: The  issue of  affordable housing  for low- and moderate-income persons has not been adequately addressed. Although Senator Bernie Sanders and Julián Castro, former Housing and Urban Development secretary, have made fleeting references, I have not heard a thorough discussion of this problem, including homelessness. I believe that decisive federal action is necessary because local and state government simply lack the resources to solve this nationwide problem. Bob Ryan San Francisco To the Editor: It  is becoming increasingly apparent that Congress has ceded too much power to the unrestrained discretion of the president on matters such as tariffs, spending (on, for example, the wall) and war by invoking an “emergency.” There must be discussion about what the candidates would support to properly  rebalance power  between the executive and legislative branches. Joel Lutzker Greenwich, Conn. To the Editor: I  have an opposite suggestion: Ban all questions about health care. We need to hear about other pressing issues. David Martocci Interlaken, N.J. To the Editor: The  Democratic debates have virtually ignored numerous  national security  issues, particularly the bloated defense budget; the overzealous tempo of military deployments; the overabundant overseas bases; the unnecessary modernization of our nuclear weapons; and the troublesome decline of arms control and disarmament. The United States has become the dominant arms merchant in the international arena and has downplayed the important instrument of diplomacy. A manifesto signed by  Bertrand Russell, Albert Einstein and others  warned years ago: “ We have to learn  to ask ourselves, not what steps can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a military contest that will be disastrous to all parties?”  The Democratic debates would be a good place to start this conversation.

How perfect that the mandate is “ no more than 200 words .” I’d like to see a discussion of the very  travesty of “debates” : prime-time manufactured, largely substanceless verbal contests with strict time limits. No nuance, no depth, no real follow-up.  It’s all sportscasting, replete with countdown clocks and sleazy previews and promotions, offering the promise of zingers, punches landed, gaffes, put-downs, rehearsed scripts, weaponized sound bites. Afterward are headlines about who won, who lost, who’s out, who came back.  How much better would be in-depth, challenging interviews, with follow-ups, rather than this sorry, unbearable sideshow.  Susan Wolfson Princeton, N.J. To the Editor: Agriculture  is being recognized as both the culprit and the savior in our race to combat climate change. I’d like to know what the candidates plan to do about the crisis affecting land stewardship and food production. In the Midwest, where I live, small farmers struggle to make a living, are ignored by federal and state governments, and often end up abandoning their important profession. It’s time to recognize that the fate of these farms is the canary in the coal mine. Vikki Proctor Evanston, Ill. To the Editor: One  glaring omission is  reproductive rights . While most candidates have at least alluded to protecting those rights, there has been no specific question about what each would do to keep the Supreme Court from reversing Roe v. Wade, even though a case challenging it is likely to come before the court in the next few years. Even more important, what would the candidates do to protect access to contraception, now covered in the Affordable Care Act? As The Times  just reported , the abortion rate is at its lowest since 1973, when it became legal, partly because of coverage of long-term contraception methods by Obamacare. Now the Trump administration is trying to roll back contraceptive coverage. How will the next Democratic president ensure that women have control over their reproductive lives? Ellen Sweet New York The writer is former vice president of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health. To the Editor: I  wish the candidates would address the  dysfunction in the Senate . Particularly, why does the Senate majority leader have such outsized power to shape national policy by controlling what the Senate will even consider? It is not a matter of constitutional law. It is just Senate rules — essentially a tradition, tacitly agreed upon among senators. The Senate does not reflect principles of democracy, and it needs reform. I would like to hear the leading candidates, several of whom are senators, discuss ways to reform the Senate and place some limits on the power of the majority leader.  Michael T. Ferro Endwell, N.Y.

"Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., said the case raises&nbsp;""constitutional issues"" regarding presidential privacy, on ""America's News HQ"" Sunday. Following  President Trump 's comments that he did  nothing wrong  during a phone call with  Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy,  Rep. Peter King , R-N.Y., said during an interview on "" America's News HQ "" that the case raises ""constitutional issues"" about the commander-in-chief's privacy. ""I think this raises very, very serious constitutional issues,"" King said Sunday. ""I think it’s wrong as a general matter to have private conversations between the president of the United States, whether it’s  Donald Trump  or  Bernie Sanders  or  Elizabeth Warren  or anyone else -- those conversations, with a foreign leader, being somehow made public."" King, a member of the House  Homeland Security  Committee, said there should be a high standard for making conversations involving the executive branch public, and compared the recent media frenzy to the hype surrounding the  Russia investigation . ADAM SCHIFF THREATENS TO DEFUND INTEL COMMUNITY UNLESS TRUMP  WHISTLEBLOWER DETAILS DISCLOSED ""Any facts coming out of a conversation between the president of the United States and a foreign leader, to me, it’s very difficult to see circumstances where that should be made public,"" he said. ""If it goes to Congress, it’ll be made public. This went on all during Russia,"" King added. ""It went to the Intelligence Committee -- then it was leaked to the New York Times... and it all turned out to be fake and to be false. But, the fact is, we can’t have the president of the United States, no matter who it is, being held hostage... even to the inspector general... This, to me, violates the separation of powers."" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif, had the opposite view and threatened to cut funding to the intel community if the contents of the call were not released. Trump fired back Sunday morning while speaking with reporters on his way to a rally in Houston, and maintained the call was above board. ""I said absolutely nothing wrong; it was perfect,"" Trump said. ""There was no quid pro quo, there was nothing,"" he later added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP King said the president should expect some semblance of privacy when dealing with foreign leaders and attending to matters of state. ""The president of the United States, except maybe [under] the most extreme circumstance -- he should have absolute confidence that his conversations with a foreign leader are not going to be made known to Congress or anyone else,"" he said.

"Asked by CNN at Saturday's Iowa Steak Fry as she was leaving the grill area what steps Congress needed to take, the Massachusetts senator said, ""Impeachment, we need to start impeachment proceedings."" Warren, who is running for President,  first called for impeachment proceedings in April  after she read  special counsel Robert Mueller's report  on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.  Since then, she has repeatedly called for the House to begin impeachment proceedings but took it a step further Friday by calling Congress ""complicit"" in ""failing to act.""  ""After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment,""  she wrote in a tweet Friday evening . ""By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump's latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president."" She also wrote in a thread  that the President ""continues to commit crimes"" because ""he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won't either.""  She told reporters after a climate change town hall Friday evening that Trump ""continues to show that he has no regard for the law."" She did not address Biden in her tweets or with reporters. ""The way to hold the President accountable is for Congress to begin an impeachment proceeding. Congress hasn't done that,"" she told reporters in Cedar Rapids. ""And what the President has now demonstrated is that he thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors. He can go back to the well on exactly what he did before. And that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election. It's time for Congress to step up and begin serious impeachment proceedings against this man."" Trump pressed Ukraine's President to investigate Biden's son  during a call earlier this summer, a person familiar with the situation told CNN on Friday.  That call, which took place on July 25, a day after Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the intelligence community inspector general, the source added. The Wall Street Journal was first to report that Trump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the July phone call to investigate Biden's son, citing multiple people familiar with the matter."
"John Yoo and Buck Sexton react. President Trump  nominated a slew of judges Friday to posts on California-based federal courts, ramping up efforts to reshape the judiciary after hitting a milestone earlier this month with the confirmation of the 150th federal judge on his watch. Two nominations are for the influential San Francisco-based  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , a long-liberal bench with jurisdiction across the American West whose political makeup has shifted with Trump’s aggressive appointment campaign. TRUMP TAKES ON CALIFORNIA OVER FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS Among the nominees is Patrick Bumatay, a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of California whom Trump nominated last year for the same job. But objections from California Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, over his lack of judicial experience and other issues, derailed the nomination. Trump later nominated Bumatay, who is openly gay, to a district court seat but his name resurfaced over the summer for a possible comeback bid for the Ninth Circuit amid a new vacancy.  While it is traditional for a nominee's home-state senators to give their approval, it is not required, and Trump lately has  bypassed the so-called “blue slip” tradition  in order to get conservative judges on the bench. While Democrats have fumed at the tactics, conservatives cheered Trump this month for seeing the 150th federal judge confirmed. “This is a historic milestone,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a statement. “As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will continue to push through highly qualified, conservative judges at all levels of the federal courts.” Graham and his Republican allies on the committee are likely to be receptive to Trump’s latest picks. Trump also nominated Lawrence VanDyke, a Justice Department official and former Nevada solicitor general, for the Ninth Circuit. Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, praised his record fighting “the overreach by the Obama Administration and its job-killing EPA.” Trump on Friday announced four other nominees for California District Court posts. But the Ninth Circuit has been a focal point given the sprawling territory it covers and its record in decades past of liberal-leaning rulings. Under Trump, the court has shifted more moderate with the addition of seven Trump-appointed judges. Nearly half of the 29 seats are now occupied by GOP-appointed judges. Last year, that number stood at six. NINTH CIRCUIT HANDS TRUMP WIN ON ASYLUM POLICY Earlier this month, the court handed Trump a win as it lifted a nationwide injunction on his controversial asylum policy, ruling that for now the injunction should only apply to states within the circuit. Trump also scored a victory from a California district court on Thursday when a Bush-appointed judge granted a request to block, for now, a law requiring presidential candidates to release tax returns in order to run in the state primaries. Democrats, though, have accused the Trump administration, along with GOP allies in the Senate, of destroying congressional custom by moving past consultations with home-state senators. Feinstein, in a floor speech over the summer about another Ninth Circuit nomination, said, “This disregard of blue slips represents another breakdown of Senate traditions.” She said screening candidates for lifetime appointments to ensure they’re qualified is a “critical” task and warned Republicans: “What goes round, comes around.” The latest nominations also come amid new legal battles between the Trump administration and California. Early Friday afternoon, 23 states banded together to sue the administration in a bid to stop its plan to revoke California’s authority to set strict fuel economy standards. That suit was filed in a D.C. federal court and does not fall in the Ninth Court, but California Attorney General Xavier Becerra touted prior rulings in his state that upheld California’s standards. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Two courts have already upheld California’s emissions standards, rejecting the argument the Trump Administration resurrects to justify its misguided Preemption Rule. Yet, the Administration insists on attacking the authority of California and other states to tackle air pollution and protect public health,” he said in a statement.  Fox News’ Gregg Re and Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report."
"True to form the President and his confederates are only adding to the chaos. In response to questioning from CNN's Chis Cuomo Thursday night, for example, Trump's personal lawyer and TV attack dog,  Rudolph Giuliani, both denied and confirmed  that the controversy may have to do with the fact that Giuliani has urged Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden is leading the pack of Democrats hoping to oppose Trump in 2020. Could it be that the President's lawyer is mixing politics and policy in an unsavory way?   As usual it's hard to follow the action, but what is known thus far should worry us all. According to various news outlets, the White House and Justice Department told the inspector general for intelligence matters there was nothing to the whistleblower's report that a high level official, most likely the President, communicated in some untoward way with a foreign leader. Under apparent pressure from the White House and Justice, the acting director of national intelligence blocked the intelligence IG from notifying Congress of the complaint, sidestepping a law requiring this. Now Capitol Hill leaders and the administration are battling over  just who has a right  to see the complaint. In a normal, pre-Trump Washington, the issue of such a complaint would have been handled in a routine, if not collegial, way. But in this era, when the White House stonewalls as a matter of course, such a conflict seems inevitable—and, too, that the President would act in a way so heedless that some intelligence professional would sound an alarm But this new crisis is completely in character for Trump, who has always operated as if personal relationships, and his self-interest, are all that really matter in every context. In every organization he has ever led, from his businesses in New York to the US government he has insisted on being the sole authority and expert, a man who ignored the rules as a matter of routine. During his decades as a real estate developer and entertainer,  Trump's style meant that he controlled  all of the many hundreds of entities under his organization's umbrella, and those who worked below him were charged with making sure his decisions -- whether good or bad -- turn out for the best, while he claimed credit for successes and dodged accountability for failures.  Then, and apparently now, Trump relied on his instinct, which often got him into big trouble. Multiple bankruptcies proved that Trump's decision-making gut is a less-than-perfect instrument. Upon examining his failures,  Susan Craig, of The New York Times, declared,  ""We found most of it was just bad business.""  As President, Trump has depended on unconventional operatives like Giuliani to help him in an unofficial capacity. For months Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, has been trying to stir up concerns about Biden and his son Hunter's involvement with a Ukrainian energy firm. An official in that country  told The Daily Beast  that Trump is seeking compromising information. Trump himself  has said ""it doesn't matter""  if the President of the United States is engaged in this slimy business. In comments to reporters Friday,  he added:  ""I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate.""    Hope for real clarity on the matter is dimmed by the fact that Trump enjoys rubber-stamp support from the Republican-controlled Senate, which has approved nearly all of his nominees for federal positions only to see  a record number leave their posts in short order.  Most recently Trump was forced to withdraw his nominee for the top job at the Federal Emergency Management Agency amid an FBI investigation. FEMA is part of the  Department of Homeland Security, where ""acting"" officials are found in striking numbers  at the top of the organizational chart.  ""Actings"" are running things across the administration. In fact, the director of national intelligence caught up in the latest mess, Joseph Maguire, is on temporary assignment and, therefore, lacking the gravitas of an appointee who really owns the job. Although officials who lack permanent status surely suffer for it, their insecurity seems to suit Trump's seat-of-the-pants style.  He has said he prefers provisional appointees  because they are more readily moved in and out of positions. They might also be assumed to be more vulnerable to whatever pressure the White House applied.  The downside, of course, is that ""acting"" leaders may struggle to get anything done or to win the respect of their troops. (Imagine, for example, an army going into battle under a general whose stars were applied with Velcro and whose orders are under constant presidential review.)      Indeed, Trump has spent his life making sure that those who serve him feel like they are never quite secure, while at the same time he has sought to make himself immune to examination. As President,  he has long banned note-takers  from some talks with foreign leaders and then limited White House reporting on his phone calls with them.  The current whistleblower controversy appears to be yet another case of Trump seeking ways to avoid accountability. The  Washington Post reported  that White House records indicate that that Trump had had ""conversations or interactions with at least five foreign leaders in the preceding five weeks"": Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani.  CNN reported Thursday that the White House and the Justice Department told the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that the nature of the whistleblower complaint isn't covered by laws governing intelligence whistleblowers.   According to CNN : ""Previously the White House has cited longstanding precedent in refusing congressional requests for documents related to Trump's meetings with his Russian counterpart. 'It is settled law that the Constitution entrusts the conduct of foreign relations exclusively to the Executive Branch, as it makes the President 'the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations,'  White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote in a letter to Democrats in May."" The President defends his secretive dealings with foreign leaders by insisting that America's international success depends on his personal rapport with them. He says he has great relationships with the likes of Putin, North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un, China' President Xi and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.   Russia, China, North Korea and Saudi Arabia have all caused trouble to America during the Trump era, and his brand of personal politics hasn't seemed to help any. Instead, it has reinforced the suspicions that many held toward Trump when he was just a self-promoting businessman. Back then, of course, his business was his business. Today, he acts on behalf of the American people. Earning their trust requires that he follow the rules.     "
"Katie Pavlich and Antjuan Seawright weigh in on how 2020 hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren will pay for 'Medicare-for-all.' Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , took a veiled shot at  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,  in Iowa Saturday for not moving to impeach  President Trump , suggesting that Pelosi's inaction enabled Trump to continue seeking foreign assistance in elections. ""Donald Trump did everything he could to obstruct justice. I read all 448 pages and when I got to the end, I called for the impeachment of Donald Trump,"" Warren said at the Polk County Democratic Party's Steak Fry fundraiser, referring to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report. ""Congress failed to act and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system,” she added. Her comments followed reports that the president repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to look into corruption accusations surrounding former  Vice President Joe Biden  and his son Hunter. NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT While many Democrats called for impeachment after the report surfaced, Pelosi reportedly has continued to oppose the ramping-up of impeachment proceedings. Warren, a  2020 hopeful , was just one of several to condemn Pelosi's inaction on the issue. ""This is absolutely insane,"" Jon Favreau, who previously served in the Obama administration, tweeted. ""We have lifelong conservatives writing pieces about how Trump should be impeached and  @SpeakerPelosi  ’s advisers are still telling reporters they refuse to hold the President accountable."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Favreau was responding a tweet by CNBC's John Harwood, which claimed that one of Pelosi's advisers put the kibosh on impeachment. Actress Debra Messing was similarly outraged, calling Pelosi's reluctance ""INSANITY."" ""I am so infuriated at the Dem Leadership.

Waiting for permission from the GOP to act is pure COWARDICE and DERELICTION OF DUTY. ACT!!"" she  tweeted on Saturday."

"""This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power to get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things if that's what happened, that appears to be what happened ... This is outrageous,"" the former vice president and 2020 Democratic candidate told reporters on Saturday before attending the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry in Des Moines, Iowa. Biden's comments come following news that  Trump pressed Ukrainian President Vologymyr Zelensky  in a July 25 phone call to investigate Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the situation. Trump has defended the call, dubbing criticism of it a ""Ukraine Witch Hunt.""  There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Speaking to local media Saturday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said he didn't think Trump had tried pressuring Zelensky during the July call, but he stopped short of saying the subject of Biden's son wasn't raised.  ""There was talk ... leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on a lot of questions, sometimes requiring serious answers,"" Prystaiko said. Biden, when asked by reporters Saturday how many times he had discussed his son Hunter's overseas business affairs, said, ""I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,"" telling the reporter who posed the question: ""You should be looking at Trump."" ""Trump is doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum and he is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" he said, growing increasingly irritated. ""Everybody looked at this and everybody who's looked at it said there's nothing there. Ask the right question."" Trump on Sunday pointed to what he says is an inconsistency in Biden's statement, telling reporters Biden ""made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son."" Hunter Biden, according to a story  published in The New Yorker in July , said he and his father had previously discussed the matter one time, saying: ""Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing,' and I said, 'I do.' "" On Saturday, Biden turned to the Democrat's 2020 presidential challenge to Trump, calling the President a ""serial abuser,"" repeating that he knows what he's up against but that Trump ""crossed the line."" ""A serial abuser, that's what this guy is,"" Biden said. ""He abuses power everywhere he can. If he sees any threat to his staying in power -- he'll do whatever he has to do. But this crosses the line. This crossed the line."" When asked if Trump should be impeached for the call, Biden replied that ""depending on what the House finds, he could be impeached,"" but he declined to go further in calling for impeachment.  Biden also called for Trump to release the transcript of his call with Zelensky to Congress. Biden isn't alone in demanding details from the call. Earlier this month, the chairmen of the House committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight announced an investigation into allegations that Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani had pressured the Ukrainian government to back Trump's reelection campaign. The lawmakers requested a transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and the Ukrainian president -- which reports later identified as the date Trump allegedly asked for an investigation into Biden's son. Later Saturday, California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, promised ""something very big, early next week if we don't get the documents that we've asked for."" ""We're going to take very aggressive action,"" Khanna told CNN's S.E. Cupp on Saturday, refusing to provide particulars. ""It could be anything from subpoenaing people who were possibly involved in the call to doing everything possible to get the documents that we believe that we're owed."" This story has been updated to note what Trump says is an inconsistency in Biden's comment concerning discussions with his son."
"Then along came Donald Trump, who gave both prominent jobs.  And last week, former White House Press Secretary Spicer was twirling in a lime-green ruffled shirt, dancing with the stars. And former Trump campaign manager Lewandowski, defiant in a red tie and jacket, was tangling with and frustrating the House Judiciary Committee's Democrats in a hearing that many could only label absurd.   Spicer's much-hyped re-emergence was not okay, wrote  Anushay Hossain , and she wasn't referring to his dance moves.  ""Sean Spicer's entire claim to fame (or infamy) comes from lying for a president who uses his office to lie, to side with dictators, to defend men who abuse women and work for him, to separate families, to stand up for white nationalism and much, much worse.  Spicer lied for a liar for a living. ""  Lewandowski, who's considering a run for a US Senate seat in New Hampshire, got an equally bad review from legal analyst  Elie Honig : "" Lewandowski was a truly horrible witness.  His demeanor was the stuff of a trial lawyer's nightmares. He was angry, combative, sarcastic, and more intent on getting off personal insults and pumping up his impending Senate campaign than actually answering questions or getting Congress or the public any closer to truth.""  Writing about the Lewandowski hearing in the Washington Post,  Harry Litman  warned, ""We may have just gotten a living glimpse of the way President Trump will continue  to distort and darken our politics long after he himself has left the scene ."" Then there's Rudy Giuliani.  The former New York City mayor actually had a national reputation before his immersion in Trumpworld, but has added a new cast to it. In a contentious interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo about an intelligence whistleblower allegation, wrote  Michael D'Antonio , "" Trump's personal lawyer and TV attack dog...both denied and confirmed  that the controversy may have to do with the fact that Giuliani has urged Ukrainian officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden."" (There's no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.) In a July call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump repeatedly suggested working with Giuliani on such an investigation, according to the Wall Street Journal. Zelensky may have a lot to gain from good relations with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. That, wrote  David Andelman , raises a ""key question: will Ukraine's new president calculate that he can win big points with the Kremlin  by giving a little help to Trump, Giuliani and their campaign  from more than 5,000 miles away?"" The Ukraine matter seemed to be at the heart of the striking new fissure in Trump's relationship with intelligence agencies.  Frida Ghitis  asked, ""What exactly could President Donald Trump have done that...drove a US intelligence official to file a formal whistleblower complaint over communications between Trump and an unidentified foreign leader...?""  She added, ""we have encountered another secret in a presidency that has been defined by obfuscation and falsehoods...  what is Trump hiding? ""  This could be seen as a warning to Trump's 2020 political rivals. In fact, Democrats should be ready for a race unlike anything they've seen before, wrote  Julian Zelizer . Now, ""Trump has the power of the presidency behind him. With that power comes  the potential for the administration to unleash damaging investigations  in the middle of the campaign that will put the Democrats on defense.""   The A team is long gone Now that generals James Mattis, John Kelly and H.R. McMaster have left the administration, along with CEOs Gary Cohn and Rex Tillerson, the President has ""surrounded himself with yes-men and is running his Cabinet like he used to run his real estate company --  as a one-man show surrounded by flunkies ,"" wrote  Peter Bergen . Trump's selection of Robert O'Brien, the State Department's chief hostage negotiator, as national security adviser last week fits right in, Bergen observed.  One of the first things on O'Brien's agenda is how to respond to the attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, which the Trump administration blamed on Iran.  Trump and his team have said many times that the President was willing to meet with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani with no preconditions -- but last Sunday Trump tweeted that was ""fake news."" It must be ""amnesia,"" Bergen noted. "" Trump's posturing back and forth between aggression and conciliation  might work for a real estate deal in Manhattan, but it's quite confusing and the stakes are also much higher when you are dealing with the complex calculations of a major regional power such as Iran.""

We're striking for ourselves, for our friends and family, for the kid who lives down the street from us.  We're striking because it's what we have to do. "" Good for them, wrote  David Gergen  and  James Piltch . Like the Parkland students and the civil rights protesters of the 1960s, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is leading a movement of conscience, one that contrasts with the do-nothing attitudes of many of their elders. ""At least once before, a children's movement was a core inspiration for our country to address its greatest injustices,"" Gergen and Piltch wrote.  ""Today, the young speak with moral clarity again."" Kavanaugh redux The controversy over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh resurfaced in a big way with the publication of a piece in the New York Times opinion section drawing on a new book by two of the newspaper's reporters. There was something for all sides to focus on.  The book,  Jill Filipovic  wrote, ""explores and corroborates previously under-reported claims by Kavanaugh's Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez that when she was a student, Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face as a joke. According to news reports, the FBI never fully investigated her claims, nor interviewed the people who reached out to them to corroborate. Thanks to constraints put in place by the White House, sources told CNN, the FBI also never interviewed Christine Blasey Ford, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, nor Kavanaugh himself.  The 'investigation' was a sham, and the Trump administration made it that way .""  The Times came in for withering criticism for its handling of the piece, since -- while it described an additional allegation against Kavanaugh -- it failed to point out that the woman allegedly involved did not remember the incident, according to her friends, and declined to speak to reporters (The Times added an editor's note with those points after the piece was originally published). The Washington Post's  Kathleen Parker  wrote, ""The recent fiasco at the New York Times, which last weekend published the latest uncorroborated sexual assault accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh,  was a monument to hearsay and a travesty of journalistic ethics. "" Also in the Post,  Marc Thiessen  welcomed the call by some Democrats to impeach Kavanaugh: ""As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose. In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Brett Kavanaugh or liberal court packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should.  So, let the impeachment proceedings begin ."" Elie Honig  blasted President Trump's tweet urging the Justice Department to ""rescue"" Kavanaugh from the allegations. That's definitely not its role, wrote Honig. Still, the calls for impeachment are futile: "" Kavanaugh almost certainly is not going anywhere ... He likely will sit on the Supreme Court for decades to come, certainly for as long as he wishes. But Kavanaugh's deeply flawed confirmation process should stand as a reminder of the danger of turning the Justice Department, long fearless and proudly independent, into an institutional political operative."" The short SNL career of Shane Gillis Days after Saturday Night Live announced that comedian Shane Gillis would be joining its cast, the show fired him for what it called his past ""offensive, hurtful and unacceptable"" remarks. Presidential candidate  Andrew Yang  had waded into the controversy, saying that it would be a mistake to dismiss Gillis for his 2018 podcast comments, which included anti-Asian slurs.  Dean Obeidallah  applauded Yang's suggestion of ""a more nuanced approach that offered the hope that people like Gillis can evolve."" Obeidallah, a former comedian and SNL staffer, wrote,  ""We should encourage and incentivize people to improve, instead of ensuring that they remain ignorant and hateful.""  Comedian  Judy Gold  thought SNL's call was sensible: ""Shane Gillis has every right to say whatever he wants -- that's what is so great about this country and the First Amendment. But let's get a few things straight. The clip wasn't exactly dug up; it's not old, it's from last year.  The clip is not funny, because it's not comedy.  It's a guy who happens to be a stand-up comic blathering with his friend, Matt McCusker, who also happens to be a stand-up comic, as they sit in front of microphones gratuitously spewing epithets and making lazy 'jokes' about other races, sexual orientations and gender without any real context or substance.""  An 'imposter'? In the midst of a challenging election campaign, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had to try to explain why he wore brownface or blackface at least three times. Amid his apologies, he admitted he didn't know how many times he had darkened his skin. ""Canada's elections take place on October 21, and it's looking like a tough race,"" wrote  Michael Bociurkiw . ""Any perception of being insensitive or hypocritical-- as an 'imposter,' in the words of one major Canadian newsmagazine earlier this year --  is certainly not the way Trudeau wants to be seen. Janaya Khan  suggested that, for Trudeau, ""blackface is a mere obstacle to overcome in his campaign run after receiving rebukes this week for darkening his face several times in the past. But for the millions of black, Indigenous and other people of color in Canada, this is far more than a simple scandal. Blackface is a reminder that people of color are  still considered to be 'characters' instead of equal and full human beings."" Be nice to the coral reefs The storms that have devastated the Bahamas are a reminder of the fragility of coastlines. Marine scientist  Michael Beck  wrote that endangered coral reefs are much more than a tourist attraction. They ""act as submerged breakwaters, they 'break' waves and protect communities and wetlands that further block waves and storm surge. ...coral reefs dampen more than 97% of waves before they reach coastlines.

"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Former Vice President  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  found himself fending off new questions about his decades-long record on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, in a testy exchange with a moderator who described his treatment of her as “condescending.”  During a Friday night forum focused on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, Mr. Biden seemed to recoil from the direct questioning from Lyz Lenz, a Cedar Rapids Gazette columnist.  In a question-and-answer session, Ms. Lenz repeatedly pressed Mr. Biden about his past votes for the Defense of Marriage Act, the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy that forbade openly gay people from serving and his statement earlier this year that Vice President Mike Pence, known for his socially conservative positions, was “a decent guy.” Mr. Biden sought to defend himself, reminding the audience in a steamy auditorium that he supported same-sex marriage before President Obama. “I didn’t have to evolve,” he said.  Then, before an audience of 700 volunteers, activists and voters, he called Ms. Lenz “a lovely person,” prompting her to reply, “just asking the questions people want to know.  Offstage after their exchange, she wrote on Twitter that Mr. Biden called her “a real sweetheart.” “I interpreted it as a little condescending,” Ms. Lenz said in a backstage interview, echoing the immediate criticism of some prominent feminists on social media.  Supporters of Mr. Biden said Ms. Lenz’s questions included a series of inaccuracies. His supporters said he didn’t back “don’t ask, don’t tell” and voted for an amendment to remove the measure from a broader bill in 1993. They also argue that she misrepresented the impact of the 1994 crime bill that he championed.  Mr. Biden had already responded to criticism of his comments about Mr. Pence earlier this year,  writing on Twitter  shortly after his initial remark that “there is nothing decent about being anti-L.G.B.T.Q. rights, and that includes the vice president.”  The forum, hosted by advocacy group Glaad, marked the first extended public discussion of L.G.B.T.Q issues in the 2020 Democratic primary race, which went largely unmentioned in the Democratic debates so far despite the group representing a loyal bloc within the Democratic Party. The focus on candidates’ past departures from contemporary progressive politics stemmed in large part from the lack of daylight between most of the major candidates on issues of L.G.B.T.Q. equality: nearly all back banning  conversion therapy  for minors; rolling back the spread of rules that allow religious businesses to decline serving L.G.B.T.Q. customers; and ending the Trump administration transgender military ban. Most have promised to pass the Equality Act, legislation opposed by the White House that would bolster the list of protected classes under civil rights law to include discrimination based on “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” “It’s about time we had a woke president on these issues,” Senator Cory Booker said, “so we see everyone for the equal dignity and equal citizenship we all have.” The candidates boasted about their accomplishments — large and small — on behalf of L.G.B.T.Q Americans. Mr. Booker noted that as mayor of Newark, he had vowed not to officiate any weddings until everyone had the right to wed. Senator Elizabeth Warren opened her appearance by reading the names of 18 trans women of color who have been killed this year. Mr. Biden said he has been sympathetic to same-sex couples since he was a boy, when, he said, he and his father witnessed two men kissing while disembarking from the train station in Wilmington, Del.  “He said, ‘Joey, it’s simple,’” Mr. Biden said. “They love each other.” In a historically diverse field, the L.G.B.T.Q. community has celebrated their own record-breaking first: Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.,  the first openly gay man  to mount a major campaign for president. Though Mr. Buttigieg has collected significant financial support from leaders in the gay community, some have begun to question his commitment to their causes. While Mr. Buttigieg frequently references his husband, Chasten, at campaign events and  told his coming out story on the debate stage  last week as an example of resiliency, he hasn’t placed L.G.B.T.Q. equality at the center of his campaign. He faced questions about a ban on gay men donating blood, pointing out that as mayor he couldn’t participate in a blood drive sponsored by his office.  “It’s an example, one of many examples, of the exclusions in this country,” he said. “We are still living with the long tail of prejudices.”  Other candidates also came with long records to tout. Mr. Biden, a reliable L.G.B.T.Q. ally, frequently points to his early support of gay marriage, noting his decision to break with the Obama administration and publicly endorse the policy in 2012. Mr. Obama followed a few days later. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii faced questions about  her history of anti-gay stances , including decrying “homosexual extremists” when her home state debated whether to legalize civil unions more than a decade ago. Ms. Gabbard has apologized for her past statements and said she no longer holds those views. “My record speaks for itself,” she said, citing her history of serving with L.G.B.T.Q people in the military and congressional record of supporting equality measures.  About 5 percent of voters in the four early Democratic primary states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — identify as L.G.B.T.Q., according to data collected by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s  largest L.G.B.T.Q. rights organization . Another 23 percent prioritize L.G.B.T.Q.-inclusive policies when voting, according to the group. The event is the first of two forums hosted by L.G.B.T.Q. organizations to question the candidates on their views. A second event, hosted by Human Rights Campaign in Los Angeles, will be broadcast on CNN next month."

"New questions surround Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son and his ties to the Ukraine; insight from investigative reporter Peter Schweizer, author of 'Secret Empires,' and Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, author of 'Witch Hunt: The Story of the Greatest Mass Delusion in American Political History.' Author  Peter Schweizer  on Friday night addressed the questions surrounding Hunter Biden’s involvement with a  Ukrainian natural gas company  while his father, former Vice President  Joe Biden , oversaw America’s Ukraine policy. ""The underlying story here involves Hunter Biden going around the world really collecting large payments from foreign governments and foreign oligarchs in the case of Ukraine,"" Schweizer, the author of ""Secret Empires,"" said on Fox News'  ""The Ingraham Angle."" CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT Joe Biden, now the Democratic presidential frontrunner for 2020, faced scrutiny for months over accusations that he pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who at that time was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Biden's son. Rudy Giuliani, a personal attorney for President Trump, has suggested that Biden worked to protect the company from investigation while in office. Biden said Friday that the claim has no credibility. The issue involving the Bidens resurfaced Friday after  The Wall Street Journal  reported that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine. Schweizer implied Hunter Biden's credentials didn't match with the position he held, and that the situation looked suspicious. ""He is supposed to be advising them on natural gas regulatory issues. He has no background in Ukraine. He has no background in energy or natural gas. So the question is, What is he being paid for? He's not being paid for his expertise, he has none,"" Schweizer said. ""His father at this time is the point person on U.S. policy to Ukraine."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The author said Trump was ""right"" to ask for an investigation and accused Hunter of lying. ""Donald Trump is right to ask the question and to ask that there be an investigation to see what Hunter Biden was being paid for. Joe Biden has offered no answers,"" Schweizer said. ""Hunter Biden, when he's been asked about this, has lied repeatedly and they've been proven lies by ABC News and other outlets.""

"To the Editor: Re  “ Claim on Trump Is Said to Involve a Foreign Leader ” (front page, Sept. 20): Donald Trump has said, “ I have the right  to do whatever I want as president.” Indeed this is mostly true. The president not only has broad powers but he can even be spared legal consequences as long as he remains in office. This was made painfully clear in the Mueller investigation. There are, however, red lines. The founding fathers did allow for congressional oversight and action in the event of a bad actor who would use the office of the presidency in service of himself rather than in service of the country. Now there is a whistle-blower in the intelligence community who has urgent information about the president that he believes Congress needs to know. It is information that Mr. Trump and the Justice Department would rather see withheld from Congress. If speculations are true, and the president himself or through an emissary threatened to withhold vital military aid to Ukraine if it did not investigate business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden’s son or pursue a corruption investigation of Mr. Biden himself, that type of quid pro quo would be deeply troubling. It is the definition of politically self-serving. Lawlessness is rampant in the Trump administration. If we want to restore the rule of law to our republic and faith in our democracy, we must insist that the whistle-blower be permitted to speak, come what may.  Felicia Massarsky Atlantic City To the Editor: The  legacy of President Trump will be a field of horrors stretching to the horizon, but interrupted by a few bits of important insight into the flaws in our democracy. Who would have thought a president would refuse to disclose his potentially conflicting business interests, then use his powers to enhance those very interests? Who would have thought that the nation’s chief executive would dispatch a lackey to threaten his duly appointed attorney general with professional execution if he didn’t reverse a principled decision? Who would have thought that in service of his re-election, the leader of the nation might have tried to enlist a foreign power to conduct an investigation of his likely political opponent? Yes, one day we’ll look back on these times with disgust, but it will be seasoned with a pinch of sardonic gratitude to the man who showed us where we might find the cracks in what we thought was the seamless wall of our democracy.

"Power Player of the Week: Academy Award-winner Denzel Washington is a national spokesman for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. This is a rush transcript from ""Fox News Sunday,"" September 22, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JOHN ROBERTS, ANCHOR: I'm John Roberts in for Chris Wallace. Tension between United States and Iran to boil over as world leaders prepare to meet at the United Nations. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: These are the highest sanctions ever imposed on a country. We've never done it to this level. ROBERTS: The United States continues its campaign of maximum pressure on the Islamic regime and -- MARK ESPER, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: The president has approved the deployment of U.S. forces, which will be defensive in nature. ROBERTS: Points the finger at Tehran for those Saudi oil attacks. MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We know precisely who conducted these attacks, it was Iran. ROBERTS: We'll ask Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the options on the table live only on ""FOX News Sunday"". Then, we'll get reaction from Democrat Ben Cardin, a key member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It's a ""FOX News Sunday"" exclusive. Plus, reports the president had an inappropriate phone call with the president of Ukraine. REPORTER: Did you discuss Joe Biden, his son, or his family? TRUMP: It doesn't matter what I discussed. It's a partisan whistle- blower. JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know I'm up against it. A serial abuser. That's what this guy is. He abuses power everywhere he can. ROBERTS: We'll discuss with President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Plus, ask or send a panel how the growing controversy is fueling impeachment talks. All right now on ""FOX News Sunday"". (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: And hello again from FOX News in Washington. The war of words over the Saudi oil attacks, which the United States blames on Iran, has turned into action, the Pentagon announcing it will send more troops to the region to boost security for allies and President Trump approving new sanctions on Iran's central bank. But the president also signaling he is not inclined to authorize an immediate military strike, which the Iranian regime has declared would mean all-out war. In a moment, we'll speak with the president's top diplomat, Mike Pompeo, who just returned from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. But first, Kevin Corke is traveling with the president, who has a rally today in Houston with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Kevin, good morning. KEVIN CORKE, CORRESPONDENT: John, good day to be with you. Right. We'll have more on that rally coming up in just a few moments, but by any measure, John, the Iranians are suffering greatly under this latest round of U.S. sanctions, just one of many weapons in the U.S. arsenal as it considers what to do next about Iran's Saudi attack. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: We have just sanction the Iranian national bank. It's going to be at the highest level of sanctions. CORKE: We'll see what happens, a familiar refrain from President Trump. When asked with the U.S. might do next to respond to Iran's attacks on Saudi oil fields. Iran denies it was behind those attacks. In addition to more sanctions, the president has authorized sending a battery of U.S. forces to the region at Saudi request. ESPER: As the president has made clear, the United States does not seek conflict with Iran. That said, we have many other military options available should they be necessary. CORKE: The strikes, which Washington says it can prove came from Iran, have pushed the regent to the brink. For its part, Tehran is threatening to escalate the violence should the U.S. or the Saudis attack even in limited form. MAJOR GENERAL HOSSEIN SALAMI, IRAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD COMMANDER: A limited invasion will not remain limited. We hand down and punish. We have proven it before. CORKE: That warning comes under day that saw the regime put its military capabilities on display, with a series of parades to mark the 39th anniversary of the start of the Iran-Iraq war and comes months after the Iranians downed and a American surveillance drone in international airspace. This in a week that will see a gathering of world leaders at United Nations General Assembly in New York where Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says he'll present a Gulf security plan. (END VIDEOTAPE) CORKE: All this as the U.S. welcomes another world leader. This time it's Narendra Modi, as you mentioned, the prime minister of India. He's here for a ""Howdy, Modi"" Texas rally with President Trump. It is set to be the largest American audience to see a foreign leader speak other than the pope. We'll bring it to you throughout the day. But for now, thank you. ROBERTS: OK, Kevin Corke, thanks very much. The president with an afternoon event with Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia as well. Kevin, we'll see you soon. Thanks. Joining me now from New York is the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday"". POMPEO: John, it's great to be with you. ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, earlier in the week, you said of the attack against the Saudi oil facilities that it was, quote, an act of war, and you said that Iran was definitely behind it. When you say something is an act of war, does that demand ultimately a military response? POMPEO: Well, John, our mission set has been very clear. President Trump would like to have a diplomatic solution, that's the task that's in front of us. That's what we've been aiming for for a little over two years now with the strongest sanctions that have ever been put in place against this revolutionary regime. And, John, you know the history. Forty years of terror from Iran. It's an anti-Semitic set of leaders that would like to wipe Israel and America from the face of the earth. Our mission set is to avoid war. You saw what Secretary Esper announced on Friday, we're putting additional forces in the region for the purpose of deterrence and defense, with our objective to be very clear, to support the Iranian people so that they can get this regime to cease behaving in a way that is so destructive not only to their own country, but to the entire Middle East. ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, there are reports this morning that Houthi militants in Yemen have warned both Saudi Arabia and the United States that Iran may be planning another attack in Saudi Arabia. Is that true? POMPEO: So, I've certainly seen that reporting and I won't talk about American intelligence and what we know. But suffice it to say, we are consistently concerned that Iran will continue to behave in the way that it has now for 40 years, it did so before the JCPOA, it did so during the JCPOA, and they continue to act in ways that are inconsistent with our obligations. I'm here this week at the United Nations. I traveled to Jeddah and to Abu Dhabi this week. The whole world understands that Iran is the bad actor. They are the evil force in the region. They are destabilizing in the Middle East, and I hope this week here in New York, the whole world will come together to push back against this and convince the Iranian leadership that this behavior is simply unacceptable. ROBERTS: That may be a tough hill to climb though, yes? POMPEO: I think there's a handful of countries that are actually supportive of Iran and what Iran is doing are certainly unwilling to push back. But it's the case; this is the world's responsibility to respond from these state-on-state acts of war that took place in Saudi Arabia this past week. ROBERTS: If Iran were to launch, in the middle of all of this, another attack against Saudi Arabia, would the United States have any other option but to respond militarily? POMPEO: John, unlike the previous administration, we try -- we do our best to avoid talking about what we will do, but the American people should know, just like the Iranian people should know, America is prepared to respond in ways that are consistent with America's national security interests. Our first aim, of course, is to keep the American people safe and secure, and part of that is to make sure that we have all the things in place so that we can do that. ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, many military and foreign policy experts, even members of the president's own support group, believe that in calling off the retaliatory strike in response to that drone shoot-down at the last minute, the president signaled to Iran that there are no consequences for its malign activities. What do you say to that criticism? POMPEO: Well, first of all, there have been consequences, real consequences. The Iranian economy will shrink by between 10 and 15 percent in the year in front of us, and we took a handful of actions, some of which I can't talk about here. So there were certainly consequences. The Iranians aren't looking for a green light. The Iranians have behaved poorly for 40 years. And so, it's not the case that any particular response has allowed the Iranians to think they have freedom to move about the cabin (ph). I assure you of this: the Iranian leadership understands four-square that President Trump will take appropriate action and impose appropriate costs on Iran if they continue to act in the way that they've done over these past now 40 years. ROBERTS: You mentioned, Mr. Secretary, at the beginning of this, the sanctions that President Trump put on Iran. On Friday, he said that there were sanctions at the highest level. If these sanctions don't work, what's next? What's left? POMPEO: Well, they are working, John. The toughest of the sanctions, the essential ban on the -- Iran's ability to sell its crude oil around the world took effect only -- (CROSSTALK) POMPEO: -- in May of this year. ROBERTS: But what I mean is if they don't work -- if they don't work to bring Iran to the table. POMPEO: As Secretary Esper said on Friday night, we're prepared to act in ways that are necessary in order to achieve the outcome President Trump has very clearly laid out. I talked about it a year ago, in May. We know what the objectives are. We simply want Iran to behave like a normal nation. ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, is it possible that if there were a retaliatory military strike against Iran, that it would be able to be contained, or would it, as Javad Zarif and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Council have warned, erupt into all-out conflagration in the Middle East, which would likely involve U.S. bases in the region, would likely also possibly involve Israel? POMPEO: We're certainly deeply aware of the risks. That's why we want to resolve this in a way that doesn't resort to kinetic action, if it's at all possible to achieve that. But as for Zarif, I don't know why nobody listens to him. He has nothing to do with Iranian foreign policy. He lies all the time. We need to make sure that we do the right things to protect and secure America and do our best to provide the resources to the Emirates and the Saudis, who I had a chance to speak to this week on my trip, so that they have increased capability to defend themselves and their own people. And when we -- when we do those things, I'm confident that we will have set the conditions for deterrence. And if that deterrence should continue to fail, I'm also confident President Trump will take the actions that are necessary. ROBERTS: All right. We will see what happens at the United Nations General Assembly this week. I'll see you there later on today. Let's switch to this whistleblower complaint. We still don't know the exact substance of the complaint but it does seem to revolve around a July 25th conversation the president had with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And we have heard from reporting in ""The Wall Street Journal"" that the president asked Zelensky about eight times to have the Ukraine work with his attorney Rudy Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's involvement in Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. To your mind, is that an appropriate conversation for Rudy Giuliani to be having with Ukrainian officials? POMPEO: Well, John, you're asking me to comment on an I.C. (ph) report I haven't seen and some reporting -- I have no idea if that has any foundation whatsoever. As for appropriate action, I've watched the president engage with the Ukrainian leadership. I listened to conversations. I remember the previous administration refusing to send defensive weapon systems to Ukraine. This president has chosen to do that not once, not twice, but now three times, so that the Ukraine people could fight back against the overtaking of southeast Ukraine. You remember, it was the previous administration that allowed Vladimir Putin to take one fifth of the Ukrainian country. We're going to see President Zelensky this week. I do hope -- I do hope that if Vice President Biden engaged in behavior that was inappropriate, if he had a conflict of interest or entered (ph) -- or allowed something to take place in Ukraine which may have interfered in our elections in 2016, I do hope that we get to the bottom of that. ROBERTS: Mr. Secretary, you said that you have not seen the complaint, not many people have. I assume, though, that you have seen a transcript of the telephone call that the president had with Zelensky. Should a transcript of that be released to clear the air? POMPEO: I'll ultimately leave that to the White House. But you know, John, those are private conversations between world leaders, and it's -- it's not often that those are released. And when they're done, it's done when the White House deems it appropriate. And I'll leave whether that should be released to them. ROBERTS: Again, I assume that you've seen the transcript. Is it as described in ""The Wall Street Journal""? POMPEO: You know, I haven't seen ""The Wall Street Journal"" piece, John. There's a lot going on in the world. ROBERTS: Right. The whistleblower complaint reportedly alleges a quid pro quo or a promise made to a foreign leader. ""The Wall Street Journal"" reports there was no evidence of a quid pro quo in that call with Zelensky. Was there a quid pro quo -- was there a request to investigate Biden and/or his son? And was that linked to a promise of aid? POMPEO: John, I've watched this president evaluate how and when and to the extent we should provide support to Ukraine, both defense assistance and other foreign assistance, we've been at the center of that. Those conversations have always been 100 percent appropriate, 100 percent lawful, and 100 percent ensuring that the American taxpayers were protected, that we put those resources to good use and we've got good outcomes in Ukraine when we used American taxpayer dollars to support the Ukrainian leadership -- every single time, John. ROBERTS: If there was a quid pro quo, would that be a problem? POMPEO: John, you're asking me to provide legal analysis on a hypothetical on a report I haven't seen. Come on. ROBERTS: I mean, if an American leader says to a foreign leader, we will do this and it might have something to do with USA, in exchange for this, is that a problem? POMPEO: John, it's the case we have foreign assistance that is evaluated against American objectives consistently. It's my duty to protect America by making sure that when foreign assistance is provided to countries, that America benefit from that. And it's completely appropriate to make sure that American taxpayer dollars are used appropriately. ROBERTS: Do believe that there should be an investigation into Hunter Biden's involvement with the Ukrainian gas company? POMPEO: I'll leave that to others, but I certainly think it's appropriate if there's concerns and there's enough information to justify looking into it. The American people deserve to know if that was handled in an appropriate way by Vice President Biden. ROBERTS: Just before we go, Mr. Secretary, are you ruling out a run for the Senate from Kansas next year? POMPEO: I've said the same thing, John, for a long time. As long as President Trump is going to have me as secretary of state, which I hope is a long time, that's what I'm going to continue to do. ROBERTS: I'm sure he wants you as secretary of state for a long time. I'm just wondering if you still have aspirations for the Senate. POMPEO: It's what I want to do, too. I want to be President Trump's secretary of state. ROBERTS: All right. Secretary Pompeo, we'll see you later on in New York. POMPEO: Thank you, sir. ROBERTS: Thanks for joining us. We'll be following all the action, of course, at the United Nations General Assembly next week. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: Interactions between President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and the president of Ukraine are under scrutiny following reports of a whistle- blower complaint, claiming that the president urged the Ukrainian to investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, potentially influencing the 2020 race. Joining me here live in Washington to talk more about this is Mr. Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Rudy, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday."" RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How are you? How are you, John? ROBERTS: I'm good. Thanks for joining us. Let's clear something up, first of all. GIULIANI: Sure. ROBERTS: Let's dial the clock back to Thursday, play this exchange between you and Chris Cuomo on CNN, in which you appeared to at first say you didn't ask Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and/or his son, and then you seemed to change her mind. GIULIANI: Right. ROBERTS: Listen. Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CUOMO, CNN: Did you to ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden? GIULIANI: No. Actually, I didn't. CUOMO: You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden... GIULIANI: The only thing I asked about Joe Biden... CUOMO: ... and his role with the prosecutor? GIULIANI: ... is to get to the bottom of how it was that Lutsenko, who was appointed... CUOMO: Right. GIULIANI: ... dismissed the case against AntAC. CUOMO: So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden? GIULIANI: Of course I did. CUOMO: You just said you didn't. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: All right, so which is it? Did you ask the Ukraine -- did you ask the Ukraine -- did you ask Ukraine to look into it or not? (CROSSTALK) GIULIANI: I clarified it immediately. ROBERTS: All right. GIULIANI: He said to me, did you ever talk about Joe Biden? I said no. Then I said, I did say that you should investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. The no was obviously wrong. I corrected it immediately. ROBERTS: GIULIANI: I corrected it before he corrected it. The reality is, the distinction is this. What they are trying to say is, I went there for a political mission to kind of get Joe Biden in trouble. Ridiculous. I went there as a lawyer defending his client. I -- I have known about this for five months. I have been trying to get people to cover this for five months. So, I knew it would be very, very hard to get this out. And what I'm talking about, this, it's Ukrainian collusion, which was large, significant, and proven with Hillary Clinton, with the Democratic National Committee, a woman named Chalupa, with the ambassador, with an FBI agent who's now been hired by George Soros who was funding a lot of it. When Biden got the prosecutor fired, the new prosecutor, who Biden approved -- you don't get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country, unless something fishy is going on. The new prosecutor dropped the case, not just on Biden's kid and the crooked company that Biden's kid work for, Burisma. That was done as a matter of record in October of 2016, after the guy got tanked. He also dropped the case on George Soros' company called AntAC. AntAC is the company where there's documentary evidence that they were producing false information about Trump, about Biden. Fusion GPS was there. Go back and listen to Nellie Ohr's testimony. Nellie Ohr says that there was a lot of contract between Democrats and the Ukraine. Well, I have all the contacts. And, John, when the rest of this comes out, and when you look at China and the $1.5 billion that the -- that the Biden family took out of China while that guy was negotiating for us, this will be a lot bigger than Spiro Agnew. They have fallen into a trap. ROBERTS: So, you went over there to investigate alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election? GIULIANI: Yes. And if I can't do that, I can't defend a client. I... ROBERTS: All right, so when did this morph into an investigation of Joe Biden and Hunter Biden? And is it appropriate for you, as a representative of the president, to be going to Ukraine and finding dirt on Joe Biden and/or his son to use politically in 2020? GIULIANI: Well, that's the way you characterize it. It's certainly appropriate... ROBERTS: That's the way it appears to line up. GIULIANI: No, it doesn't. ROBERTS: You went there for one thing, you found out something else, and that's what you have been digging on this. (CROSSTALK) GIULIANI: That's the way the pro-Biden media lines it up. This began with someone coming to me saying, this information can clear your client about the corruption in Ukraine between the Ukraine, the Democratic Party, the ambassador, and the FBI agent who investigated the case. (CROSSTALK) ROBERTS: But it then -- but then it morphs into Biden. GIULIANI: And -- inextricably combined, because Biden had the guy fired, Shokin. By the way, his statement is on record. The lazy press could go read it. They don't have to listen to me. There are three videotapes of prosecutors on record, available on here, that nobody has covered for five months, because this town protects Joe Biden. His family has been taking money from his public office for years, $1.5 billion from China, when our vice president is supposed to be impartially and independently negotiating for us? And the kid, he takes him on Air Force Two to China, and the kid... ROBERTS: That was in 2013. GIULIANI: Yes. And the kid, unfortunately, is a drug addict. China didn't give $1.5 billion to his kid, Biden's kid, a recovering drug addict, Kerry's stepson, and Whitey Bulger's nephew. Ladies and gentlemen, go look at what the press has been covering up on you. Can you imagine... ROBERTS: This is a company called Rosemont Seneca. Let me just -- let me just come back, if I could. GIULIANI: You got to stop for a second. Whitey Bulger's nephew? ROBERTS: Let me just stop for a second. GIULIANI: One-point-five billion coming from China, when our vice president... (LAUGHTER) ROBERTS: Mr. Mayor... GIULIANI: That doesn't shock you? ROBERTS: ... let me stop for a second, because... GIULIANI: I mean, how far have we deteriorated? ROBERTS: Let me stop for a second, because we are throwing around a lot of Ukrainian names that people don't know about. GIULIANI: Well, that's because nobody would ever cover this. ROBERTS: Viktor Shokin was a prosecutor back when Biden was the vice president. He was looking into Burisma Holdings... GIULIANI: Right. ROBERTS: ... of which Hunter Biden was on the board of directors. GIULIANI: Correct. ROBERTS: There were some allegations that there was some monkey business going on with Burisma. (LAUGHTER) ROBERTS: Joe Biden -- Joe Biden -- Joe Biden went over to Ukraine in 2016... GIULIANI: Right. ROBERTS: ... and said that, I'm going to withhold more than a billion dollars in loan guarantees unless you fire this prosecutor. Joe Biden talked about that in 2018. Let's roll that. GIULIANI: Right. (LAUGHTER) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars. I said, you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here. And I think it was, what, six hours. I look at it. I said, we're leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: But Shokin had been heavily criticized for corruption. And it was the United States and a number of other Western countries who said... GIULIANI: So is everybody in the Ukraine. ROBERTS: ... he needs to go. GIULIANI: More relevant... ROBERTS: So, was this tied to Hunter Biden, or was this the United States saying, you have got a bad actor there, because he was accused of corruption in his office? And other countries in the West were saying he needs to go as well. GIULIANI: What does it matter, if the -- if the son is under investigation? He didn't disclose that. Doesn't the thing strike you? I mean, it is so warped. Doesn't it strike you as strange that he would tell that story and not mention to you that his son's company was the major defendant in the investigation, the guy who was carrying on? Do you -- I happen to know -- and I have seen the records -- do you know why he was fired? Do you know how the kid was paid? Three million dollars goes from Ukraine to Cyprus -- I'm sorry -- Ukraine to Latvia, Latvia to Cyprus, Cyprus to Rosemont Seneca. I have seen each one of the wires. When that prosecutor, Shokin, subpoenaed Cyprus, he got a response. I have the record. They gave him all the information, but two people, Hunter Biden and John Kerry's stepson -- I'm sorry -- John Kerry's speechwriter, who was the best friend of his stepson. ROBERTS: The prosecutor who followed.. GIULIANI: When that happened, Joe Biden knew that they were zeroing in on Hunter. And he went over there and he got him fired. And the next day, people showed up. And they started on getting the case for the kid dismissed, as well as the case for Soros. And that's what brings me into it. ROBERTS: Now, the prosecutor -- the prosecutor... GIULIANI: No, you got to let me finish. ROBERTS: OK. GIULIANI: He said, I went there to get dirt on Joe Biden. Do you know, when I found out about Joe Biden, do know what I told my colleague? They are going to cover this up. Too bad Biden is involved in this. I got a nice straight case of Ukrainian collusion. The minute I say Biden, that Washington press corps is going to go nuts. They have been covering up for years, China, plagiarism. ROBERTS: OK. OK. All right. Now you're straying into areas of opinion, as opposed to fact. GIULIANI: No, I'm not. I'm straying into what is wrong with us today and the unfairness. ROBERTS: We need to point out -- we need to point out that Yuriy Lutsenko, who was the prosecutor who was appointed after Shokin was fire... GIULIANI: Approved by... ROBERTS: ... resurrected, reanimated the case, and found that Hunter Biden was, in fact, paid millions of dollars. But Lutsenko said that the board of Burisma was able to pay a board member whatever they wanted, and he didn't see anything wrong with that. GIULIANI: John, how is the coverage so distorted? ROBERTS: I'm just pointing out a fact. GIULIANI: If you did any work, you would find out Lutsenko is the prosecutor that Biden put in. There's a newspaper article in which Biden approves Lutsenko when he's appointed. Doesn't that strike you as odd, that the vice president would approve a particular prosecutor? Did you ever bother to look? (CROSSTALK) GIULIANI: Let me finish. ROBERTS: One other point we need to make here before we go. GIULIANI: No, no, no, I want answer another question unless you let me finish. This is really unfair. These are very important things that have been covered up for years to protect slimy Joe. The reality is that there are three other prosecutors where all you have to do is go online, three others, that say that this was done precisely to get rid of Biden, to cover up Hunter, and to cover up Soros. I will give you their names. One of them is Kulik, Konstantin Kulik. The other is Shokin himself. And the third one is a prosecutor by the name of Inazdir (ph). They are present officials. Three of them were officials. One is still an official of the Ukrainian government. If you bothered to look, you could listen to them on tape telling you that. Now, they may all be lying, but Lutsenko may be lying also. But it's 3-1. ROBERTS: One more point we got to make. GIULIANI: And Lutsenko is Biden's chosen prosecutor. ROBERTS: OK. You have made your point. One more point to make we need to make. GIULIANI: You will also find there is a great deal of suspicion. ROBERTS: Yes, Joe Biden yesterday told our Peter -- Joe Biden told our Peter Doocy yesterday that he never discussed overseas business with his son Hunter. GIULIANI: Do you believe that? ROBERTS: I don't know. Do you believe that? GIULIANI: I'm flying my son to China. How long is the flight to China? ROBERTS: Its a while. GIULIANI: Fifteen hours, 16 hours, 17? I'm flying my son to China on Air Force Two. I'm going to negotiate with the Chinese to help America. My son is going there to negotiate to help the Biden family. When he comes back, and eight days later, the kid gets a billion dollars in his ridiculous private equity fund run by a recovering drug addict, somebody connected to the vice president of the United States and somebody connected to the biggest gangster in America. Wait a second. The son doesn't say to him, I got a billion dollars? By the way, you see what Joe said? It's contradicted by the son. The son said, I talked to my father about it. How about this? There was an article on December 9 of 2015 in ""The New York Times"" raising holy hell about Biden's son being on the board of the most corrupt company in Ukraine and how strange it looked. I don't know if Joe reads the newspapers, but somebody must have read that to him. And, finally, if Joe didn't know what his son was doing abroad, how may conflicts are there? This guy was flying blind? I don't know. Did he get money from Russia? Did he get money from Cuba? Was he doing business in Venezuela? You're telling me that the vice president of the United States was there for eight years. His son is going around the world taking millions from some adversary of the United States. ROBERTS: Yes. GIULIANI: Don't say yes. This is important. ROBERTS: No, no, we have -- I'm saying we have got to go. GIULIANI: This is about the only time I have gotten to point out a tremendously large scandal that affects the American people. And it's your job to do it, not just mine. I'm doing it to defend my client. ROBERTS: We are out of time. GIULIANI: But you're telling me that he had no system with his son to check on conflicts? So we know of two. We know there's a big conflict with Ukraine. We know there is a big conflict with China. Since Joe says and is apparently selling the swamp media on the fact that he didn't know, well, Joe, how many more conflicts are there? Venezuela? Cuba? ROBERTS: You have mentioned that. We have got to leave it. Mr. Mayor, we are... GIULIANI: One-point-five billion is enough for most people to get investigated. ROBERTS: We are out of time for this morning, but, clearly, we are going to keep looking into this. GIULIANI: And this is going to get bigger and bigger. And everything I say, I can prove. ROBERTS: Rudy, thanks so much for being with us. GIULIANI: Take me on. ROBERTS: All right. Appreciate it. Coming up, we will get reaction to the president's Iran policy with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Ben Cardin joins us here next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: Coming up, President Trump authorizes new economic penalties on Iran. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We have just sanctioned the Iranian national bank. It's going to be at the highest level of sanctions. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: We'll ask our Sunday panel whether the move will bring Tehran back to the negotiating table, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: As the United States boosts its defenses in the Middle East after blaming Iran for the attacks on Saudi oil facilities, the Islamic regime says it's ready for any scenario. Joining me here in Washington, Senator Ben Cardin, a top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator, welcome back to “Fox News Sunday.” SEN. BEN CARDIN, D-MD: John, it's great to be with you. Thank you. ROBERTS: So the U.S. is sending more troops and defensive weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to counter the threat coming from Iran. Your thoughts about sending more men and material there? CARDIN: John, this is a very dangerous situation. There could easily be a miscalculation. The temperature couldn't be harder between the United States and Iran. Our job is to isolate Iran. Iran is the bad actor. And what the president needs to do is get an international coalition to continue to work against Iran's support of terrorism. The challenge, of course, is, because, as the United States has been isolated when the president withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement. So we're having difficulty with our European allies to get the type of support we need, but we have to isolate Iran. ROBERTS: There are reports that -- from the Houthis apparently to Saudi Arabia and to the United States, I don't know if you saw my question to the secretary of state, that Iran is planning another attack in Saudi Arabia. If Iran were, in the middle of all of this, launch another attack at Saudi Arabia, would that demand a military response? CARDIN: There's really not a military solution to the problem of Iran. We need to make diplomacy work. Clearly there could be a miscalculation. We have to defend ourselves, no question about that, but we have to reduce the temp -- where we are, where we could have this miscalculation. It would be disastrous if we got into a fighting war in Iran. It will have consequences throughout the entire region. It's not in our national security interests. ROBERTS: All right, so we've got the United States ramping up sanctions on Iran, withdrawing from the JCPOA, which you yourself didn't -- didn't vote for. And Iran is countering by shooting down American drones, firing missiles and launching drones at Saudi oil facilities. I mean they are in a shooting war. So is -- is this -- is this -- I mean if you let somebody fire at you and you don't shoot back, are you not showing weakness? CARDIN: Well, John, here -- here's the fault of the Trump policies. Before we withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreements, there were conversations with the Europeans about strengthening the sanctions against Iran for the non- nuclear violations. We could have had that international support and tightens the economic pressure against Iran, but still stay within the nuclear agreement. By pulling out of the nuclear agreement, it's the view of Europe that this is an American problem rather than an international problem. ROBERTS: But -- but you know the arguments, this president said, look, it covers the nuclear, but it -- there's a sunset clause to it of a decade, which isn't much when you look at, you know, the history of nuclear development. But it also does not do anything to reign in Iran's malign activities. I pointed out, you yourself did not vote for the JCPOA because you were worried about future uranium enrichment. So why stay in a bad deal? CARDIN: No, I agree with that analysis, but the way to fix it is to work with Europe, work with our partners to deal with the non-nuclear violations, strengths the sanctions against Iran on the non-nuclear side, make sure they stay in compliance with the nuclear obligations. They were in compliance with the nuclear obligations when the United States pulled out. The bottom line is, we made -- the -- we isolated the United States rather than isolating Iran, and Iran is the bad actor. There's no question about it. We don't know what they're going to do, but we certainly need the support of our international partners. ROBERTS: But how serious is Iran about the JCPOA? The United States pulled out. There is still five signatories to it, yet Iran is violating the agreement. CARDIN: Well, the issue is, Iran -- we don't know how Iran's calculating this, but we do know that the U.S. sanctions is having a major impact on their economy. So the benefits they thought they were going to get under the nuclear agreement, they're no longer getting. ROBERTS: Right. CARDIN: That's causing them to recalculate. ROBERTS: For the moment, President Trump says he's showing restraint about Iran. He's got people like Secretary Pompeo saying it's an act of war. Others are pointing fingers, like Mark Esper and Pompeo at Iran. The president saying, I'm going to sit back and wait and see how this plays out. Listen to what he said in the Oval Office the other day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: I think the strong person's approach and the thing that does show strength would be showing a little bit of restraint. Much easier to do it the -- the other way. It's much easier. And Iran knows, if they misbehave, they're on borrowed time. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: So you've got the president's aides on the one hand saying, act of war, Iran's responsible. The president saying, I'm waiting and seeing her. He's leaving the door open to negotiation, even amidst all this tough talk. Could that be a good strategy to try to bring them to the table? CARDIN: I think it's an important week with all the world leaders -- most of the world leaders meeting up in New York for the opening of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I hope that we can get that type of unity with the international community in regards to Iran so that the military option is not the right option. I agree with Secretary Pompeo that diplomacy should be the way we proceed. I agree with that. And hopefully this week we can get the type of support in New York to make a difference in the calculation by Iran so that they stop these horrible things. What they're doing is horrible. We can't let them continue to do that. ROBERTS: Let me switch to this intelligence committee inspector general whistle-blower report. ""The Wall Street Journal"" reported on Friday that the president had a conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, in which he about eight times pressured Zelensky to have Ukraine work with Rudy Giuliani to look into Joe Biden. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said today, quote, I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure. So you have Democrats on the one side calling for the president's impeachment over this, and then you have the Ukrainian foreign minister saying, I don't see any pressure. CARDIN: I think we need to know what happened. The allegations are that the president used the power of his office for partisan political purposes, jeopardizing the national security of the United States by withholding aid to Ukraine, one of our key, strategic partners. That -- ROBERTS: Nobody's made the connection about aid yet. We don't even know what this thing's about. CARDIN: We -- we -- at least there's been some reports that there was $250 million that were held up, ultimately was released -- ROBERTS: I think people have connected the dots, but I don't think we've got anything really to back that up. CARDIN: Well, that's what -- let's find out. Let's -- let's find -- let's have transparency here. We can easily find that out if information about those phone calls would be released and we could see exactly what's involved. But the president has chosen, at least to date, not to release that information. These are serious allegations. Let's find out. I -- I -- I don't want to reach a conclusion. I'm just suggesting to you that an allegation that the president used his political office for partisan reasons, jeopardizing our national security, we need to get to the facts. ROBERTS: Is there a case to be made to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's -- their involvement in Ukraine? Let's listen to what the president said and what Joe Biden said the other day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he is not giving to a certain country less a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. BIDEN: Not one single, credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion. Not one single one. And so I have no comment except the president should start to (INAUDIBLE). (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: Now, in fact, a lot of credible news organizations, including ""The New York Times,"" have been looking into this. Ken Vogel, who's the reporter who wrote about it -- and here's the article -- back in May said on Friday that there's -- this could be a significant issue for Joe Biden and that there's more there. CARDIN: Well -- well, John, I know what happened in 2015 with the prosecutor. The international community needed that prosecutor to leave. Congress wanted that prosecutor to leave. Corruption was the center problem we had with Ukraine, maintaining our coalition against Russia for -- with sanctions. And we had to deal with the corrupt issues and the prosecutor was in the center of that. So that -- that was a policy that we wanted to implement. Joe Biden's issue has been looked at for a long time. There's been findings that there is no improper involvement. This is a distraction by the president of the United States to distract from his most recent situation. ROBERTS: You don't want to prejudge the situation with the president and his whistle-blower, but a lot of your Democratic colleagues are already making the leap to impeachment. Is that going too far? CARDIN: I -- I think you need to get the facts. I don't think you should -- you know, the impeachment process is a way in which Congress exercises its responsibility, checks and balances in our system. But you can't act on that type of a remedy until you have the facts. So let's get the facts first. ROBERTS: Senator Cardin, always good to see you. CARDIN: Nice to be with you. ROBERTS: Thanks so much for coming in. Coming up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the prospects of a showdown between the United States and Iran. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: I think it's abundantly clear and there is an enormous consensus in the region that we know precisely who conducted these attacks. It was Iran. NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What would be the consequence of an American or a Saudi military strike on Iran now? MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: An all-out war. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: The top diplomats from this country and Iran in a war of words this week over the fallout from the attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil industry. And its time now for our Sunday group. Jonah Goldberg for ""The National Review,"" Fox News political analyst Juan Williams, Susan Page of ""USA Today,"" and Matthew Continetti, founding editor of ""The Washington Free Beacon."" Are we going to war, Susan, with Iran? SUSAN PAGE, ""USA TODAY"": Well, judging from your interview with Secretary of State Pompeo, I'd say probably not. He -- you asked them if it's an active war, does that demand a military response, and he repeatedly denied -- declined to say yes. And judging from what the president did in June, after the American drone was shot down and he backed away from a military strike, I think the odds are against us taking military action in this case. ROBERTS: The fact that he backed away from that strike, does that mean that he cannot take military action? MATTHEW CONTINETTI, ""WASHINGTON FREE BEACON"": No. I mean he could take military action at any time. He's the commander-in-chief. What we're seeing, though, is that the maximum pressure campaign of the Trump administration has met maximum resistance from the Iranian regime. And the cyber operations and the economic warfare that the Trump White House has been waging against Iran has yet to deter them from their malign behavior in the region. But, that status quo is something I think the president prefers to all-out war. ROBERTS: Right. It -- the -- Congress is saying he's got to come to Congress for an authorization to use military force against Iran. First of all, does he have to? And if he went to Congress, would he get it? JONAH GOLDBERG, ""NATIONAL REVIEW"": It depends. I think we would need more provocation than what we have seen. I'm sort of a purist on this kind of stuff. I do think that you should go to Congress, unless it's in response to an immediate and urgent national security thing, then it -- Congress has the -- has the sole authority to authorize war. But we've seen that eroded so much over the last 50 years, like so many other congressional prerogatives that I think it's anybody's guess. JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: I think, John, based on your question, you can tell there's no clear end game in sight. What we know is the president says he doesn't want war there, but he's previously also said we're locked and loaded. And what was incredible to me was to hear him say that he's waiting for guidance to come from the Saudis. Now, the Iranians are no friends of ours, but, gosh, the Saudis, I don't know if they're a reliable and trustworthy regime. They kill American journalists. 9/11 is not to be forgotten. ROBERTS: And here's another argument that people made. The United States has sold Saudi Arabia, and the president made a big deal of this, billions of dollars in military equipment. Can't the Saudis handle this themselves? PAGE: And -- well, I guess we're going to find out. I mean we're making this gesture to Saudi Arabia with a very limited deployment. But -- but, yes, Saudi Arabia has a lot of defensive abilities, a lot of it provided by the United States, helped by the United States. WILLIAMS: But I think the key point here is, Iran has denied responsibility, but we have no reason to trust that they are not responsible, or at least supporting the Houthi rebels that did this. But the point from the American political perspective is, we are still trying to get out of Afghanistan. There is no appetite in his country for starting another war without a clear end game in sight. And the president has not provided that. CONTINETTI: And the president's policy, it reflects exactly that attitude though. WILLIAMS: Right. We all know what we're doing (ph). PAGE: And the president's base doesn't back it either (ph). CONTINETTI: He doesn't want to get involved either. What's remarkable here, for 70 years plus, the United States has guaranteed the free flow of oil from the Persian Gulf. That is ending. At its ending because of fracking. ROBERTS: Let's get on to the whistle-blower issue here. President Trump, he was leaving for Houston a short time ago. He said this about his conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of the Ukraine, back on July 25th. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: The conversation I had with the president of Ukraine was absolutely perfect. And people better find out who these people are that are trying to subvert our country, because here we go again. These are bad people. But the conversation I had with the president of Ukraine was absolutely a ten. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: So it was a ten. Is there anything wrong with the president saying to the president of the Ukraine, look, why don't you work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate what ties Joe Biden and Hunter Biden have to Ukrainian natural gas companies. PAGE: Yes. It's soliciting foreign help in your campaign for re-election for president of the United States. And it's something that I think people would generally find alarming. ROBERTS: Now, the Ukraine helped Hillary Clinton, so -- GOLDBERG: Yes, OK, look, I mean we've got to separate a whole bunch of things here. The idea -- you know, people who are -- you know, President Trump has -- has some weird messaging on this. On the one hand he says it's all made up and fake news. On the other hand he says he was spied on, which would suggest that, in fact, the allegations are true. Rudy Giuliani comes on air today and take great umbrage at the accusation or insinuation that he's a political hit man, and then he spends the next seven minutes like the -- one of the biggest political hit men I've ever seen. It could be -- I don't -- I think there's a lot of smoke and -- and bluster going on in what Giuliani is doing. It could all be true. If the president of the United States tried to bend national security, based upon his own partisan self-interest, that would be very, very, very bad. And the people who say he's just interested in corruption, this seems to be the only corruption case in the world he's concerned about, is the one about the guy who's beating him by ten points in the polls. ROBERTS: ""The Washington Examiner"" had an article this morning that suggested that the whistle-blower does not have firsthand knowledge of any of this. But the point is, is that if you're going to investigate the president, and there are 9,573 investigations of the president going on right now, should you not also investigate the person who might become president? CONTINETTI: A lot of conversations in Washington over the last 48 hours have begun with the word ""if."" And the fact is, we don't know. And so I think the advocates of impeachment in this case carry a heavy burden, John. One is that with the Russian investigation, there was a whole lot of misreporting and factual inaccuracy in the actual reporting. Two, when the Mueller report came out, it did not provide the data that Democrats wanted to impeach. And, third, all of these charges, as illustrated in Rudy Giuliani's interview with you, have the potential to boomerang on the Democratic Party. ROBERTS: All right, so let me ask you about the Democratic Party, Juan. You heard Ben Cardin say he doesn't want to prejudge anything. He wants the information. He wants to see this. You've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. You've got Elizabeth Warren. You've got a myriad of other Democrats not even waiting for a shred of evidence here. They're looking at reporting and saying, impeach him, off with his head. I mean should they not wait -- do they not have a responsibility to wait until we know some facts here before we got down the impeachment road? WILLIAMS: Yes, I think everyone should wait. But, remember, there's no reason to wait on the transcript. If, as the president describes it, nothing untoward took place, why is it that the administration is making such an effort to obstruct the Congress from getting that transcript? What we know is -- ROBERTS: It's not the transcript that they're not holding back -- WILLIAMS: Well -- ROBERTS: It's the complaint. WILLIAMS: Well, the complaint, the transcript, the whole thing. If -- because the transcript goes beyond the complaint, which is why I said transcript. But the idea is that this administration has, through the Justice Department, stop what is the law. The law says that if you have an urgent complaint, the inspector general of the director of national intelligence would transfer that to the Congress. It's not going on. That is wrong. GOLDBERG: Previous presidents have also disputed the idea that the president has an obligation by the -- by statute to do that. It's a -- it's a murky constitutional issue. PAGE: The one Democrat we haven't heard from calling for impeachment is the one Democrat who counts, Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She set a standard that we need to hear Republicans be outraged by the president's behavior, not just Democrats. And so far we haven't heard that. ROBERTS: Fifteen seconds. CONTINETTI: We'll be waiting for a long time. ROBERTS: Yes, Fifteen seconds, should the transcript be released? WILLIAMS: Of course. CONTINETTI: I think if it exculpates Trump, they should release it. But there is the issue of executive privilege here, governing foreign communications, which also needs to be respected. WILLIAMS: If this was Obama, House Republicans would have -- ROBERTS: We've got to go. Thanks, Juan. See you next Sunday, by the way. Coming up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" Denzel Washington and the club he says made him the man he is today. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: For many children, the hours between three and 8:00 p.m. are when their futures are decided. As Chris Wallace reported last fall, one organization has opened its doors for over 100 years to make sure that kids have a place to go after school and stay out of trouble. One of those kids became a household name, and he is our ""Power Player of the Week."" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DENZEL WASHINGTON, BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS NATIONAL SPOKESMAN: It's where I learned so many life lessons, just thinking I was having fun. CHRIS WALLACE, HOST (voice over): Denzel Washington is talking with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Four thousand local clubs that provide after-school programs for more than 4 million young people. And, in the process, change lives. He was in Washington last fall for the group's annual dinner. WASHINGTON: I remember that first day and how I felt and how special they made me feel. WALLACE: And to honor the national youth of the year. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Malachi Haynes. WALLACE: Malachi Haynes of Colorado, who's been going to his club since he was six. MALACHI HAYNES, BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB 2018 YOUTH OF THE YEAR: Being a leader and a role model in my community is my purpose. WASHINGTON: I was a wild one. You know, I was -- I had a lot of energy. WALLACE: Washington used to run track for his club. And he remembers when a new kid came in and started running faster. One of his mentors took him aside. WASHINGTON: He said, he has natural ability, but his natural ability will only take him so far. So I applied that to -- to -- to my career, my first two years when I started acting in college. WALLACE: Washington won the first of his two Oscars for his role in ""Glory,"" about an African-American military unit in the Civil War. For more than 30 years, he's played a series of indelible characters. WASHINGTON: To protect the sheep, you've got to catch the wolf. And it takes a wolf to catch a wolf, you understand? I was never interested in being a movie star. We were sort of New York theater snobs. I wanted to be James Earl Jones, you know? I was hoping to make $650 on Broadway one day. And -- and I did. WALLACE (on camera): Your father was a preacher and I've read that at various points in your life you've thought about becoming a preacher. WASHINGTON: Uh-huh. WALLACE: Really? WASHINGTON: It was prophesies that I would preach. And -- by this woman. And I said, well, maybe that's what I'm supposed to do. And says, well, you already have a pulpit. WALLACE (voice over): Now, Washington is more about giving back. WASHINGTON: You never see a U-Haul behind a hearse. That's what my pastor told me. You know, you -- whatever you have, you can't take it with you. So the question is, what are you going to do with what you have while you're here? WALLACE (voice over): The Boys & Girls Clubs deal with the ups and downs of life too. Kids at the clubs do better at school, are less likely to do drugs, and volunteer more. Malachi started his own program to improve reading levels. HAYNES: We call it Double Trouble. So we do an hour of reading, then an hour of playing basketball, eating pizza, just hanging out and getting to know the kids. WALLACE: And Denzel Washington says that's the real message here. WASHINGTON: We're just bombarded so much with negative news that the -- one can just feel like, well, what's the -- what's the use? But listening to these young people saying, oh, no, no, we're going to change it, we're going to do something about it, I'm -- that's inspiring. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: Chris asked Washington where he sees himself at this stage of his career. He says he uses stuntmen more than he used to but is excited about the unknown and what comes next in his life and career. And that's it for today. Chris is back again next weekend.

"  The UN General Assembly is always a high stakes event for national security, but this year's gathering will take place amid rising tensions with Iran, a nuclearizing North Korea, the degradation of the global nonproliferation agenda, ongoing humanitarian crises and more.      And the UNGA already has a dark cloud hanging over it. As world leaders descend on New York City, they are already well aware of the urgent whistleblower complaint, lodged by a member of the intelligence community, concerning at least one of President Trump's communications with a foreign leader as well as Trump's own admission that he discussed Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Sunday,  the President said , ""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption).""    These world leaders may be convinced Trump is more concerned about his own political standing than the security of the American people. This waters down the credibility of any US national security work as our peers wonder whose interests the President and his team are really serving: America's or Trump's.      Trading places The United States has often been a champion for promoting the rule of law and anti-corruption around the world, including through the UN.  The concept of the rule of law is even embedded in the  UN charter  -- and through the  State Department  and other US government entities we have programs focused on advancing it overseas.  However, our ability to advance rule of law and anti-corruption initiatives globally takes a direct hit when the President is viewed as a poster child for the kind of actions we're trying to get other countries to stop doing.   President Trump reportedly pressed Ukraine's President Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son,  a source told CNN . And Rudy Giuliani confirmed that he also asked the Ukrainian government to investigate the former Vice President, even though there is no evidence of wrongdoing from either Joe Biden or his son Hunter.    This  news only bolsters the idea that the President is abusing his power to engage in self-dealing. Allegations of nepotism,  emoluments violations , channeling business to  Trump properties  and more have already painted a picture of a President doggedly pursuing self-interest.  Taken with new allegations of self-dealing and abuses of power, other leaders may now need to include anti-corruption talking points on their agenda when meeting with President Trump.    We have urgent business with Ukraine, including helping them to deter Russian aggression. Instead, because of the President's reported actions, the meeting may be overshadowed by the whistleblower complaint, Giuliani's efforts, and getting the story straight on their last phone call.  Ukraine has already been roped into this domestic US issue. Their Foreign Minister  issued a statement  saying that Zelensky didn't feel pressured and that Ukraine is an independent state. Zelensky and his team are trying to walk a fine line between keeping the President happy (they must know his ire has consequences ), without drowning in his political hot water. Fighting Trump's battles is likely not a priority for Zelensky. He has real ones of his own -- including an  ongoing armed conflict  with Russia -- going on at home.    This dark cloud of potential conflicts of interest and abuse of power will likely carry over into other meetings as well, like the President's meetings with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Polish President Andrzej Duda, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.      Even before the whistleblower complaint and the administration's decision to freeze security assistance to Ukraine earlier this year, world leaders were aware that  Trump is willing to cut off foreign assistance  to countries who won't (or can't) do his bidding. The idea that the President relies on explicit or implicit quid pro quos to score political wins has only been bolstered by recent events. Foreign leaders now have good reason to wonder whether incoming Trump requests are campaign 2020 calls or actually have to do with national security.    Fairweather fan    While Trump's bilateral meetings at the UNGA this week will be critical, his approach to the United Nations itself may indicate that he's a fairweather fan of the United Nations.   Even before he assumed office, President Trump had railed against the United Nations, saying it was "" not a friend of democracy ,"" and as President-elect he said the UN was causing problems and would be a waste of time and money if it didn't live up to its potential.  With his America First agenda, Trump's preferred not to play with others -- he's not a fan of coordinating with other countries through international institutions. He's withdrawn from  some UN entities  and  cut US funding to others . Trump's 2019 budget request even proposed cutting voluntary  US funding to UNICEF . His  UNGA remarks  last year even included a statement that ""America will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance, control, and domination.""   This year, the President may need to turn to the UN for support. While the formal UN agenda includes a host of topics that the President doesn't like -- including  climate change and sustainable development  -- he's probably going to try to get other member states to focus on what's top of mind for him, like  reports  that Iran was behind the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, after several months of  illegal activities in international waters, and a host of other malign activities. Iran's increasingly aggressive behavior will likely be a key topic for Trump in both public and private discussions.       The administration recently rolled out new  sanctions against Iran  and announced the deployment of more US forces to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But these actions would benefit from UN backing.  We've already cut off most transactions with Iran and these unilateral US sanctions probably won't have a lot of bite unless we're willing to punish foreign entities and individuals who violate our new sanctions or the UN passes similar ones. So making a compelling case about Iran's activities at the UNGA may be on top of Trump's to-do list.    Odd man out     While he's seeking to convince his global peers about the threat from Iran, Trump will probably try to water down their focus on another malign actor: North Korea.     North Korea conducted several  missile tests  over the last few months  -- a sign of its advancing arsenal -- and experts say its nuclear stockpile is expanding.  Trump's former National Security Adviser John Bolton said that North Korea's missile tests  violate UN Security Council resolutions , but Trump still  downplayed the missile tests . His stance on North Korea will likely be at loggerheads with that of our allies at the UN and will add to the general perception that there is no coherence when it comes to Trump's approach to rogue regimes.      While North Korea said that it welcomes a "" new method "" of talks with the US, denuclearization discussions remain stalled. Meanwhile, Trump argues that Kim "" likes testing missiles "" and he'll probably use his time at UNGA  to make the case that Kim deserves special treatment in the eyes of the international community. While many of our allies are concerned about North Korea's advancing illegal capabilities, Trump's the odd man out. Perceptions that his national security strategy is irregular and incoherent at best -- and more likely driven by naked self-interest -- will continue to proliferate"
"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Former Vice President Joe Biden  is facing accusations of  sexism  this week after he pushed back on a female moderator's question about his record. The incident occurred at the ""LGBTQ Presidential Forum"" hosted by GLAAD and the Iowa Gazette on Friday. One of the Gazette's writers, Lyz Lenz, seemed to question Biden's progressive bona fides when she asked about his opposition to the  ""Don't Ask Don't Tell""  policy and a compliment he paid to Vice President Mike Pence. 
      Joe Biden speaks at an LGBTQ Presidential Forum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Friday. (Rebecca F. Miller/The Gazette via AP)
       ""You have also praised  Vice President Mike Pence  as a decent guy,"" Lenz said, drawing boos from the crowd. ""You're a lovely person,"" Biden shot back with a smile on his face. Lenz defended herself, saying that she was just ""asking the questions that people want to know."" According to some, like Time Magazine editor Anand Giridharadas, Biden's response was related to the moderator's gender. ""Last week, Joe Biden gave us an occasion to talk about 'racism with a smile.' Now he’s doing 'sexism with a smile.' Watch him grow angry at  @lyzl 's solid question -- and then try to slap her down in the most patronizing way,"" Giridharadas tweeted on Saturday. Jamil Smith, a senior writer at Rolling Stone, similarly accused Biden of ""Paleolithic behavior."" ""I admire Lyz’s professionalism in this moment,"" he tweeted. ""Sad that it was even necessary. Biden keeps exhibiting this kind of Paleolithic behavior, and too many folks will excuse it because they’re used to seeing their male elders act like way. There is no such thing as benevolent sexism."" Others piled on with critical tweets on Saturday. After the exchange on Friday, Lenz hinted that Biden continued his sarcasm as she walked off the stage. ""As I was walking off the stage with  @JoeBiden  he said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart,'"" she  tweeted. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The former vice president has also faced scrutiny for allegedly  inappropriately touching  women and his longtime support of the  Hyde Amendment , a policy blocking taxpayer funding of most abortions.  Biden announced he had changed his stance  and opposed the Hyde Amendment earlier this year, shortly after his run for the presidency."
"Zelensky, a former comedian, secured a  landslide election victory in April . With no previous experience as a politician, he has to confront Russia's occupation of Crimea, as well as the ongoing conflict in the eastern region of Donbas with Russia-backed separatists. This may be a unique moment in the modern history of Ukraine. Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Trump, who are driven by their own respective political agendas, have suddenly inserted themselves in the midst of what could become an international imbroglio with Ukraine. But Putin, Trump and Zelensky have converging interests, and all three could potentially come out as winners in a scenario that leads to the withdrawal of Russian troops from eastern Ukraine, lifted sanctions on Russia, and the reelection of Trump. Ukraine has played a  key role in Russia's success  long before President Vladimir Putin rose to power. Ukraine's  fertile black-earth farmland  has long been a key Russian breadbasket, while the Donbas region is a major locus of heavy industry and  mineral reserves . Its Black Sea ports, particularly in Crimea, are  crucial to the Russian navy .  Even after the fall of the Soviet Union and Ukraine's independence, its rulers were often inclined to maintain  amicable relations  with Russia. In 2014, when the Maidan revolution toppled the pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Russian forces blithely moved in and annexed Crimea, then sent anonymous paramilitary forces known as ""little green men"" i nto the heart of Donbas . The European Union, along with the US, levied a series of tough  economic sanctions   that continue to weigh heavily  on the Russian economy. More than five years after the annexation, Putin remains desperate for these sanctions to be lifted. Now, Ukraine appears to have become at least as critically important to Donald Trump, for a whole different set of reasons. It is here, Trump seems to believe, that he can pin charges of  corruption on the son of Vice President Joe Biden , a Democratic candidate he clearly fears. And suddenly, both he and Putin appear now to have a Ukrainian president in power who is at the very least open for dialogue. At first,  Zelensky  supported Ukraine's eventual membership in the  European Union and NATO —both moves utterly anathema to Putin. Then the new Ukrainian leader proposed  ending the war  with Russian-backed forces in the Donbas by negotiating with Putin, and struck a hostage exchange with the Russian president that was lauded by President Trump as a ""first giant step to peace."" But he has also been especially interested in  ending the rampant corruption  that marked the  rule of his predecessor ,  Petro Poroshenko . Which is what seemed to give an opening to Donald Trump. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is  interested in what he describes as  Biden's efforts to oust Ukraine's top prosecutor because of an investigation into the natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where the former vice president's son Hunter Biden, had a role on the board  The allegation against the Bidens has been debunked by respected fact-checking teams at news organizations including CNN. At least one former official in the prosecutor's office  said the investigation into Burisma had already been shelved  by the time Joe Biden was pressuring Ukraine to replace its top prosecutor, who was unpopular among many Western leaders due to concerns regarding corruption. It's also unclear if Hunter Biden was a focus of that investigation when it was occurring.  Despite this, it appears Trump and Giuliani believe Zelensky should look into the matter. In May, Giuliani  abruptly canceled his trip to Ukraine  a day after he announced his intentions to meet with Zelensky in Kiev. Instead, he traveled to Spain in August,  and met with Andriy Yermak , a lawyer who serves as the president's aide.  According to  Politico , the State Department said that the meeting had been facilitated by  Kurt Volker , who has served abroad under four American presidents and is currently  executive director  of the McCain Institute for International Leadership and US Special Representative for Ukraine. I have known Volker as an individual of the utmost probity, and he, like the most seasoned American diplomats, clearly understands the need for all sides to feel as though they are coming out as winners. Which may be where the interest of all three key players converge. Consider this scenario. Putin would no doubt very much like to see a second term for Trump. Already, the American president is pressing fellow members of the G7 to welcome Putin back into the club next year, and floating the  idea that he will host the summit at his Miami golf resort . If Trump wins the 2020 election, he'll be freed from any need to win the support of voters. Trump would also presumably be free to move toward lifting sanctions against Russia, no matter how strenuously Congress -- and the rest of the western alliance -- might protest.  Zelensky, for his part, could do a big favor for Putin by digging into whatever Giuliani might want to help his client's presidential re-election effort. Putin, in turn, might even reciprocate by easing up on military actions in Donbas (though it is unlikely ever to return Crimea to Ukraine). In the Oval Office on Friday, Trump suggested he was not acting in his own personal interest by  saying  ""I always look for the conversation that's going to help the United States the most."" In the same discussion, he also described the whistleblower, who filed an official complaint,  as having a ""partisan"" agenda . Clearly hedging his own bets, Zelensky has held at least two c onversations with the Russian leader , and is also keen to  forge ties with the US .  The US released a $250 million military aid package days after  three House committees announced  a wide-ranging probe that would, among other things, look into whether such packages were being held hostage for the president's own political benefit. It is not unreasonable to expect that any future transactions would be smoothed by congenial relations between Zelensky and Trump, or even Putin. The key question: will Ukraine's new president calculate that he can win big points with the Kremlin by giving a little help to Trump, Giuliani and their campaign from more than 5,000 miles away? And how might this play out the next time Zelensky faces re-election, after winning a landslide victory on an anti-corruption campaign? Some of this could be sorted out next week in New York since, as the  Kyiv Post reported,  Trump and Zelensky might actually meet during the United Nations General Assembly session. Putin will  not be on hand , as has been customary in recent years. Certainly, clearing the air sooner rather than later, however, would by far appear to be in the best interest of all three leaders. Zelensky, Putin and Trump will need to set forth just where their most profound priorities—and loyalties—lie."

"The labor union's show of strength so far has amounted to nearly 50,000 autoworkers indefinitely on strike with the promise of being compensated only $250 per week. The strike comes at a great time for the scandal-ridden union. It offers the UAW the opportunity to restore its tarnished reputation with workers after several UAW officials were  implicated in a federal probe  last week concerning embezzled member dues. Expenses were reported for luxury items such as golf outings, expensive cigars and extended stays in private villas among other things,  according  to a federal criminal complaint. The union issued this  statement  in response to the probe: ""While these allegations are very concerning, we strongly believe that the government has misconstrued any number of facts and emphasize that these are merely allegations, not proof of wrongdoing."" It makes you question whose best interest the UAW has in mind. On Sunday they  rejected  a contract offer from GM that met several of the union's demands and could have avoided a strike altogether. Instead, both workers and the company will experience losses while the UAW tries to play hard ball. Surely, the UAW wants GM to experience some pain in order to demonstrate its value. But how long are they willing to wait it out when autoworkers' livelihoods are on the line, especially when a reasonable deal seems obtainable.  Under the proposed contract  submitted  on Sunday before the strike began, GM would have invested $7 billion in 8 facilities in four states, promising over 5,400 jobs. Additionally, workers would have gotten lump sum pay increases and an $8,000 signing bonus, among other benefits. It's not a total win for autoworkers, but it's a respectable compromise that warrants serious consideration. This strike goes beyond the basic needs and working conditions of GM employees. It taps into growing public support for unions.  According  to a recent Gallup poll, 64% of Americans approve of labor unions. Others are piling on, using the strike to advance a larger agenda for American labor like increased unionization and worker benefits. Union support has been expressed by many high-profile Democrats, such as Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Of the strike, Sanders  called  on GM to ""end the greed"" and Ocasio-Cortez  tweeted , ""In a time of record profits, workers should prosper, not suffer. That's why unions play a key role in an economy that works for everyone."" Politicians who truly stand with the American worker, should call for more thorough investigations into corruption claims like that of the UAW embezzlement scandal. They could also support the Department of Labor in their union transparency efforts, such as the recent  proposed T-1 Rule , which will bring transparency to union-controlled trusts and expose financial corruption in those funds. Both workers and GM are losing a lot of money as a result of the strike. However, the UAW is benefiting from its show of strength, as are politicians and pundits rushing to make use of the strike to advance their agendas.  For the sake of the autoworkers who want to continue making GM a success, the UAW needs to more carefully consider the best interest of workers."
"President Trump and others put increased pressure on Democratic presidential rivals; Kristin Fisher reports from Washington. An article in the  Washington Post  this week was widely mocked for comparing Democratic  2020 presidential  hopeful  Sen. Elizabeth Warren  to historical icon Frederick Douglass -- over the way they posed for photos. WaPo reporter Hannah Natanson began her piece by pointing out that 19th century abolitionist Douglass (1818-1895) ""appears alone in almost every photograph, staring down the camera in isolated, thoughtful splendor,"" while Warren ""features today in countless iPhone photos and Instagram feeds, her arm around voter after voter, always bearing the same wide grin."" ""The two are separated by race, gender and more than 100 years of history that forged an America that would probably be unrecognizable to Douglass,"" Nathanson wrote. ""Still, experts say, their use of photography collapses the distance: Douglass sat for scores of pictures to normalize the idea of black excellence and equality, and Warren’s thousands of selfies with supporters could do the same for a female president."" WARREN GETS STUMPED BY COLBERT WHEN PRESSED ON MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES TO FUND MEDICARE-FOR-ALL The piece goes on to cite professors who support the comparison presented by Natanson that both Warren and Douglass were ""smashing stereotypes."" “She’s presenting a public image of herself as somebody who is presidential,” Columbia University professor Alexander Alberro said. “What Douglass tried to do was to create a public persona in the face of the negative type of image of African Americans at the time … so I think the comparison is really good.” Louisiana State University professor Nichole Bauer suggested that even if Warren goes on to defeat in 2020, her ""million selfies are just a little bit more of a crack in that glass ceiling.” Still, the comparison raised many eyebrows on social media. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Journalist Jordan Chariton went even further, accusing The Washington Post of ""propping up"" Warren and ""defeating"" her progressive opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. ""Just when you think @washingtonpost can't get anymore absurd in their campaign to prop up @ewarren (and defeat @BernieSanders), they are now comparing Warren taking selfies with people to......Frederick Douglass,"" Chariton tweeted."
"""The president asked a foreign power to help him win an election. Again,"" the former secretary of state tweeted, referring to Trump's call during the 2016 race for Russia to look into Clinton's deleted emails. Clinton's tweet included a video of  Giuliani's comments on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time""  Thursday, when Chris Cuomo pressed the former New York mayor over conversations he'd had with a  Ukrainian official  about Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who had investigated the former vice president's son, Hunter. ""Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?"" Cuomo asked Giuliani.  ""No, actually I didn't. I asked the Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016 by the Ukrainians for the benefit of Hillary Clinton, for which there is already a court finding,"" Giuliani responded. ""You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden and his role with the prosecutor?"" Cuomo asked. ""The only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that (Yuriy) Lutsenko, who was appointed, dismissed the case,"" Giuliani said. ""So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?"" Cuomo pressed. ""Of course I did,"" Giuliani said. When asked about his contradicting answer, Giuliani said he ""didn't ask"" for Biden to be investigated specifically, but asked Ukraine ""to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme."" Asked Friday if he discussed the former vice president with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed"" but that someone should look into Biden. During the 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump called on Russia, China and other hackers to turn over Clinton's emails. ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump said in July 2016.  Then-White House press secretary  Sean Spicer later said Trump was ""joking""  when he publicly asked Russia to hack his Democratic rival."

"Rep. Kevin McCarthy defends Trump against whistleblower report. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy  defended President Trump Friday in the wake of a new report that claims the commander-in-chief asked the president of Ukraine numerous times in a single phone call to investigate  former Vice President Joe Biden ’s son. ""I think this president has been through enough. He’s proven he can do the job and why are people listening to his calls and selectively putting something out for political gain?"" McCarthy said on "" Special Report with Bret Baier ."" ""Let this president govern this nation. He’s proved he can do it economically,"" McCarthy said before adding ""This world is safer because of President Trump."" The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate. CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. Biden said on Friday that the claim has no credibility. Baier asked McCarthy if he had ""a problem"" with the reported request made by Trump, to which McCarthy replied that ""more facts"" are needed. Baier continued to press McCarthy, but he would not be drawn into commenting. ""You don't have any of the facts,"" McCarthy told Baier. ""Let's wait till next Thursday and let's go through the appropriate channels. Have we not learned this lesson how many times before.""

"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass.,  announced Saturday that he will mount a primary challenge to  Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass ., next year. The 38-year-old Kennedy -- the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy – formally announced his candidacy at a community center in Boston after weeks of rumors that he was mulling entering the race. AOC ENDORSES ED MARKEY, GREEN NEW DEAL CO-SPONSOR AHEAD OF POSSIBLE SENATE PRIMARY ""Donald Trump has forced a long overdue reckoning in America, and how we respond will say everything about who we are,"" Kennedy told supporters. ""We have to take on the broken system that gave rise to him in the first place — the outdated structures and old rules, the everyday oppressions and injustices that hold our people back.""

       Should Kennedy win, he would be the fourth Kennedy to serve in the Senate, joining his grandfather and his great-uncles John F. Kennedy, the 35th president, and Edward Kennedy. Edward Kennedy was the last member of the prestigious political family to run for Senate, winning election in 1962. The challenge to Markey, 73, is likely to leave local Democrats, including 2020 presidential hopeful and fellow Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., with a difficult choice of who to back. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,  has already endorsed Markey, with whom she has worked closely on the  Green New Deal  resolution introduced in Congress earlier this year. ""Ed Markey is a proud and strong progressive champion for working families -- not just in Massachusetts but across the country,"" she said last week.

       Markey, who joined thousands of young climate change activists who rallied in Boston on Friday as part of a global, youth-led day of environmental action, has the backing of many environmental activists. One of those groups — Environment Massachusetts — has vowed to raise $5 million to help Markey win re-election. Kennedy positioned himself as a more pragmatic Democrat when he was first elected to Congress in 2012, but has since adopted a series of left-wing stances. He has backed impeachment proceedings against President Trump, ""Medicare-for-all"" and the Green New Deal. In 2018, Kennedy gave the Democratic response to Trump's State of the Union address. Despite the blue-on-blue challenge, Kennedy has not yet moved to criticize Markey. ""Senator Markey is a good man,"" he said. ""This is going to be a tough race."" But Markey responded on Saturday by challenging Kennedy, along with other primary opponents, to a debate on how to respond to the question of climate change -- an issue he has been advocating on for decades. He proposed it be held in November. ""I was very disappointed at the Democratic National Committee's refusal to hold a debate on climate change for our presidential candidates,"" Markey said in a video message. ""So today I'm challenging Congressman Joe Kennedy, Shannon Liss-Riordan and Steve Pemberton to a climate change debate, and to do it very soon."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “For the next generation, we can’t wait,” he said. Liss-Riordan, a workers' rights lawyer, and Pemberton, a former senior executive at Walgreens, are also challenging Markey. The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Former Governor of Arkansas and Fox News contributor  Mike Huckabee  was candid in a new episode of  Fox Nation 's  ""Quiz Show,""  where he discussed his famous daughter, and favorite hobbies, as he squared off against host Tom Shillue on TV show trivia. QUIZ SHOW MUST-SEE MOMENTS ""Most of the time I'm just known as Sarah's dad,"" said Huckabee, cutting short his introduction. Asked how he felt with his new title, Huckabee said he didn't mind taking a back seat to his daughter, who served as the White House press secretary under Trump before leaving her post in June. ""It's fine,"" he said, ""I don't mind sharing some of the public scorn with my daughter."" TOM SHILLUE TRIES TO STUMP DR. OZ, FAILS At one point in the episode, Huckabee took a jab at 2020 Democrat Joe Biden, referencing a  recent gaffe  made by the former vice president during a  Democratic presidential primary debate  last month. Huckabee joked that if he didn't perform well on the quiz show, he'd make sure his agent never booked him on the show again -- and Shillue granted him permission to ""call his direct line"" if that were the case.

"DETROIT — The Democratic presidential candidates have been chasing labor support all summer, appearing at small union halls and large conferences, and tweeting support for workers at companies like Amazon and Walmart. But now, as the United Automobile Workers, one of the nation’s largest unions, stages a strike that has even drawn words of support from President Trump, Democrats are seizing the moment to align themselves with workers in public and dramatic ways. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts walked the picket line Sunday alongside striking General Motors workers at an assembly plant in Detroit. Not to be outdone, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appeared at another G.M. assembly plant in  Kansas City , Kan. The picket line visits of two of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination — with the third, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, planning to join striking workers in Detroit on Wednesday — illustrated the importance to Democrats of winning the support of rank-and-file union members, including those who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. Taking her message of fighting inequality to Michigan for the fourth time since June, Ms. Warren joined a scrum of striking autoworkers, carrying a blue and white “U.A.W. on Strike” sign. As they crisscrossed the entrance to the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant, where Cadillacs and Chevrolets are built, the workers chanted, “We are the union, the mighty, mighty union. U.A.W. stand strong.” Ms. Warren criticized G.M. for closing plants while making billions of dollars in profits. “G.M. is demonstrating that it has no loyalty to the workers of America or the people of America,” she said. “Their only loyalty is to their own bottom line. And if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to anywhere else on this planet, they will do it.” “Everybody deserves a living wage in this country,” she said. “Let’s be clear, unions built America’s middle class and unions will rebuild America’s middle class.” U.A.W. leaders in Detroit voted unanimously a week ago to authorize the strike, the union’s first such walkout since 2007. The union is pushing G.M. to raise wages, reopen some plants and add jobs at others, and narrow the pay gap between new hires and veteran workers. Nearly 50,000 members have joined picket lines  at factories across the South an d the Midwest.  Every major Democratic presidential candidate has expressed support for the striking workers, and several have visited picket lines to appeal to union members who may have switched their support to Mr. Trump. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota joined the one in Detroit on Thursday, while Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio traveled to several in his home state and in Flint, Mich. Addressing the striking U.A.W. workers in Kansas City on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Biden wore a red T-shirt in solidarity. He referenced the bailout of General Motors during the Obama administration, telling the crowd, “We didn’t bail out GM, U.A.W. bailed out GM!” He went on to lament the high pay of executives at the company and the lack of equitable benefits for workers, and he encouraged the striking workers, acknowledging, “you’re making a hell of a sacrifice.” “There’s only one reason we have a middle class, and it’s spelled ‘U-N-I-O-N,’” he said. The crowd cheered. Auto-worker support for the Democratic Party has eroded slightly in recent years, and  about 30 percent of the union’s rank and file  were estimated to have voted for Mr. Trump  in 2016, slightly more than the share who voted for the two previous Republican presidential nominees. The departure of those voters from the Democratic Party, even as the union had officially endorsed Hillary Clinton, was particularly critical to Mr. Trump in Michigan, where  he won by the thinnest of margins  — less than 11,000 votes — to capture the state’s 16 electoral votes. Nearly three years later,  it is unclear how many of those union workers continue to  back the president. The economy has generally remained strong here, with unemployment near a 20-year low. Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat who represents a district just outside of Detroit that is home to several auto manufacturing facilities, said she felt that Mr. Trump’s support among autoworkers had held roughly steady. But she said she believed that a prolonged strike could move the president’s numbers among such workers in one direction or the other, depending on whether they viewed him as trying to help or hurt them. “If he’s perceived as trying to keep the plants open, and it’s successful, it could have a positive impact,” Ms. Dingell said. In 2016, Ms. Dingell was a  lonely voice  among Michigan Democrats as she raised concerns that Mr. Trump could carry the state, even going so far as to hold a meeting with Democratic legislators in her district several weeks before the election warning them not to underestimate his appeal. Ms. Dingell said she had heard frequently from autoworkers at dozens of community meetings in 2016 that they were “with Donald” and that they believed he sincerely cared about trade. Mr. Trump last week expressed hope that the strike would be a “quick one,” complaining about General Motors’ decision to close domestic plants and open factories offshore, and taking a swipe at the company’s leadership, which announced last November that the company would close four plants in the United States. “I got tremendous numbers of votes from the autoworkers,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. “I don’t want General Motors to be building plants outside of this country. You know they built many plants in China and Mexico and I don’t like that at all.” While Mr. Trump ran as a friend of workers, some labor leaders have said that was largely empty rhetoric. In a recent interview on Fox News, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Richard Trumka, said workers were suffering, and criticized the White House’s inaction on the minimum wage. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump had said he supported hiking the federal minimum wage, currently at $7.25 an hour, to $10. “He’s opposed every increase in the minimum wage,” Mr. Trumka said. “He’s changed the regulation to take overtime away from a couple of million people. He’s proposed trillion-dollar cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. He’s rolled back health and safety standards toward workers.”  As a crowd of about 200 waited for Ms. Warren’s arrival on a sunny day, blocking the entrance to the idled plant, some sang along to a recording of Aretha Franklin’s “Respect,” the message directed at G.M. management. Many wore red T-shirts that said “Solidarity, No More Bull.” In many ways, Ms. Warren’s central message, which emphasizes the struggles of middle- and low-income Americans, appeals to the same frustrations that Mr. Trump tapped into in 2016 — pent-up anger at an economy and system that workers view as unfair. “Personally for me, this is a lot bigger than G.M. and the autoworkers,” said Mike Mucci, a worker who was on the picket line outside the Detroit plant on Sunday. “This is a fight for the middle class.”  Mr. Mucci, 43, who said he was not a fan of Mr. Trump, predicted that the president would “do anything he could to try to take credit for saving the U.A.W.”  Robert Hatline, 61, a retired G.M. worker who voted for Mrs. Clinton in 2016, said he was impressed with Ms. Warren’s plan to provide free public college. “I like what she says if she can do it,” he said. “I want to see student loans reduced off these kids.” Carla Duckett, 60, a team leader on the Cadillac line here, said she would support whichever Democrat the U.A.W. endorsed. “I just know we’ve got to support the Democrats this time,” she said.  Ms. Klobuchar, who delivered doughnuts when she visited the picket line on Thursday, described how G.M. workers had suffered during the economic downturn and how the company had “bounced back.”  “This particular company has been making a lot of money and that means to me that you got to share it with your workers,” she said. “And that means better wages, that means health care, and that also means the long-term benefits that our workers deserve. That’s what this is about. It’s about shared prosperity, that we’re all in it together.” Mr. Sanders’s Wednesday visit will follow a stop on Tuesday at a labor rally in support of the Chicago Teachers Union. In August, Mr. Sanders released his  Workplace Democracy Plan , which he has said would double union membership during his term and give workers increased workplace protection. Mr. Ryan, who cited the closing of the Chevrolet Cruz plant in Lordstown earlier this year as the impetus for his presidential campaign, joined G.M. workers outside the idled plant last Monday. “When a group of workers lose their jobs, it causes massive disruption in the whole community,”  Mr. Ryan tweeted . “Kids of these workers have to deal w/ either move to a new state & school; or the trauma of a parent being laid off. Educators are often left to help pick up the pieces.” G.M. last year announced its plans to close the four plants, including the one in Lordstown, with hundreds of workers electing to relocate to other G.M. facilities. The Hamtramck plant, which makes the Chevrolet Impala and the Cadillac CT6, is slated to shut down in January. The idled plants have become an issue in the negotiations, with workers also pushing G.M. to improve wages, add jobs at other facilities, pay a greater share of employee health care costs, and close or narrow the difference between pay rates for new hires and veteran workers. Pointing to a $50 billion federal bailout of G.M. in 2009 following the financial crisis, as well as union concessions, many G.M. workers have said they view the decisions as particularly callous. The company paid the government back most of the money. The Democratic presidential candidates have joined picket lines in previous strikes, including the McDonald’s strike in May and the Stop & Shop strike in April, as they jockey for union endorsements. But with a couple of isolated exceptions — the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America  endorsed Mr. Sanders  last month, and the national firefighters’ union endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in April — unions  have been holding back , many waiting until they see which Democratic candidate wins the support of the rank and file. Maggie Astor, Neal E.

"""Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion,"" Biden said Friday. ""Not one single one, and so I have no comment except the President should start to be president."" Biden said no more about the issue as he and his staff loaded into a van to depart the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, after hosting a town hall on Friday afternoon.  His remarks came as a communication between Trump and a foreign leader prompted  a whistleblower complaint that is now at the center of a dispute  between the director of national intelligence and Congress. The whistleblower's complaint deals at least in part with Ukraine, The New York Times and Washington Post reported Thursday night, prompting speculation that it could be tied to reports that the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, had asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.  Trump pressed Ukraine's President to investigate Hunter Biden during a call earlier this summer, a person familiar with the situation said Friday. In 2014, while Biden was vice president under President Barack Obama, Hunter Biden joined the board of a natural gas company called Burisma owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. In 2016, while Burisma was being investigated, Western governments, including the Obama administration, called for the removal of Ukraine's top prosecutor due to concerns about corruption in his office. Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor wasn't let go. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  On Thursday, Giuliani denied asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden but moments later said he had done just that. Giuliani's comments came in a heated exchange on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" as Chris Cuomo pressed the former New York mayor over conversations he'd had with a Ukrainian official about Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of the prosecutor -- who had investigated Burisma. Earlier Friday,  Trump continued to blast news of the whistleblower complaint  in the Oval Office, calling it ""a ridiculous story."" ""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" he said, adding, ""It's just another political hack job.""  Trump said he doesn't know the identity of the person who made the complaint. Later Friday, Biden released a statement about the whistleblower complaint, saying: ""If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump's willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. ... At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress."" UPDATE: This story has been updated with additional context about the lack of evidence to support the allegations against the Bidens. "
"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders sits down with Bret Baier following the debate. For the third straight time, the  Democratic  presidential debate in Houston led with a discussion of health care. As Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., put it: ""Every one of my colleagues on this stage believes in universal health care."" Booker’s statement prompts this question: Why should government get involved in health care for Americans who do not require government assistance? Most Americans believe the  government  should provide a ""safety net"" for the poor. It does this with assistance such as food stamps. However, you do not hear anyone calling for an expansion of food stamps to cover all Americans regardless of whether they are rich or poor. So why is that the case with health care? HOW MUCH WOULD 'MEDICARE FOR ALL' COST? DEMOCRATS' HEALTH CARE PLAN EXPLAINED The federal government, through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – more commonly known as food stamps – provides  assistance  to low-income people. The government does not make the food or control the price of food. It does not dictate what foods people should buy. And the government provides absolutely no food assistance to the majority of American households. This is a ""safety net."" It is designed to make sure the poorest among us have food on their table. There seems to be broad agreement that food stamps are a good way to address the nutritional needs of our poor. In health care, we have something similar. It is called Medicaid. It provides funding for medical services for low-income and disabled people. We also have Medicare, which provides health insurance coverage for older Americans. So the government already has programs in place to take care of the health of our poor and elderly. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Until President Obama came along, there seemed to be rough consensus that this was the right way to ensure America took care of its poor and elderly. Most Americans were, presumably, in a position to take care of their own health care. Most accomplished this by working in job that provided health benefits, buying their own insurance, or relying on a parent or spouse's health insurance plan. Others chose not to buy insurance and to pay for care as they received it. Obama and his fellow Democrats insisted that every American have government health care or private insurance, and thus devised ObamaCare, which expanded Medicaid to cover more Americans. In order to cover everyone else, for the first time in our nation’s history the federal government made it illegal not to purchase a particular product: in this case, health insurance. Yes, even if you paid tens of thousands of dollars for your child to become a doctor who could take care of you for free, you still were legally obligated to buy health insurance. Now health care is again front and center for Democrats. They say ObamaCare is not enough. They insist America must provide free health care for every single American, old and young, rich and poor. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., criticized former Vice President Joe Biden’s plan in the last debate because it only covered 97 percent of Americans! For his part, Biden proudly announced that under his plan the government will tell drug companies what they can charge for drugs. With government now involved in everyone’s health care, we are seeing the adverse effects. Everyone is now on government health care or mandatory insurance, and insurance premiums cost the same regardless of a person’s heath, destroying much of the free market in health care. Where are the menus of services with prices at the doctor’s office? They are not there because people do not care what the cost is because they don’t pay it! The government and insurance companies are in the middle, determining what and how much to pay, but never sure about what services the doctor or hospital actually provided. Fraud, therefore, runs rampant. Patients have no incentive to shop for better pricing, and doctors have no incentive to provide it. Patients similarly have no financial incentive to avoid doctor visits by maintaining a proper diet and exercise. As a result, we have runaway increases in the costs of health care. The Democratic solution? For Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others on the stage, it is to put the final bullet in what is left of the free market in health care. Progressivism has taken over the Democratic Party. It no longer believes in free markets. History shows that if government would get out of the way and allow the free market to do its thing, there is no telling what solutions would emerge for health care. New technologies utilizing the Internet, cell phones, Skype, and artificial intelligence would be fully exploited. Competition would bring down prices, as we have seen in areas of medical care not covered by the government or insurance companies. Sanders complains that America is ""the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people."" America also is the richest country on Earth. Has he ever considered that the two may be related? It is precisely because America does not hand over control of large sectors of its economy to the government that we have had such economic success. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Why is a safety net insufficient for Democrats? Is it about control? Is it about destroying free-market capitalism wherever they can? Is it in pursuit of a liberal utopia where everyone is treated the same? We do not know. The question was never asked.

"Image Bernie Sanders greeting supporters after a campaign event in Reno, Nev., this month. Credit Max Whittaker for The New York Times Bernie Sanders has gone much further than  any of the other 2020 Democratic presidential candidates  in proposing not just more money for affordable housing, or more enforcement of fair-housing laws, but also fundamental changes  in how the housing market functions .  His most startling ideas — a national rent control standard, and new taxes on land speculation and house  “flipping”  — would bring America closer to the idea that housing should be treated as shelter and not a commodity. But in the  housing plan his campaign released Wednesday , Mr. Sanders doesn’t go all the way there. He allows for profit, but not certain kinds of profit, or profit by certain kinds of actors. In that middle ground, somewhere between the private market and social housing for all, things get complicated. The national rent control standard Mr. Sanders has proposed would cap the amount that landlords can raise rents, to shield tenants from escalating housing costs and, in a deeper sense, the excesses of capitalism in the housing market. Landlords could raise the rent by no more than 3 percent per year,  or  one and a half times the rate of inflation, whichever is higher.  His housing plan says nothing about the profits of people buying and selling homes in the normal course of homeownership. In fact, Mr. Sanders would invest an additional $8 billion into federal programs to help first-time home buyers, precisely because homeownership in America is often a means of building wealth. Between the two proposals lies a fraught balance: One would curb profits in the housing market, while the other acknowledges that many Americans depend on those profits. Mr. Sanders’s campaign seeks to reconcile the two by arguing that rich investors or landlords shouldn’t get to make so much, while ordinary American families should have a chance to make something.  “We want to return to the notion that homeownership can be an asset builder for working people and average American families, and it is not just a vehicle to commodify to make the rich richer,” said Josh Orton, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign and its national policy director. In practice, however, it’s not always obvious how to distinguish the working families from the rich investors, or how to devise policies that crack down on the one but not the other. Some middle-class families, for example, build wealth by owning rental properties. And landlord groups are skeptical that 3 percent rent increases would build them much wealth, especially when property taxes, insurance rates and utilities aren’t also capped.  Mr. Sanders’s proposal would also put a hefty tax on house flipping, hitting owners who sell a property for more than the original price within five years of purchase (for a place they don’t occupy). But that definition would cover people we don’t think of as flippers: a small-scale general contractor who remodels two homes a year; a family that buys a home for an aging parent who later dies; a landlord who herself faces financial distress and must get out of the business. Mr. Sanders has similarly proposed a tax on empty homes, aimed at speculators who sit on vacant properties until they become more lucrative to redevelop, or simply profitable to resell. That is a real problem in some communities, leaving neighbors to live with blight for years. But owning an empty home doesn’t necessarily make you a speculator. Someone who has put a property on the market and struggled to sell it for months might end up facing this tax.  The full proposal, emphasizing the feel-good parts of the market but not the others, is trying to have it both ways, said Jenny Schuetz, a housing economist at the Brookings Institution who has been  following housing proposals from the 2020 candidates .  “In some ideal universe, people would buy homes (or rental properties) that appreciated slightly faster than inflation, allowing them to build wealth, but without housing costs rising too fast to pressure renters, deter new homeowners, or create excess capital gains,” Ms. Schuetz wrote in an email. “In that context, both rent control and flipping taxes make sense. The problem is, with any semblance of a private real estate market, land and housing values don’t behave that way.” She is skeptical that it is even possible to design or regulate a market that gives modest returns to individual homeowners, but never gives big returns to landlords; that penalizes greedy flippers, but never harms small-time contractors; that taxes vacant homes but doesn’t punish working families. Mr. Sanders’s ideas invite a host of questions about how they would technically work (how do we police a million landlords?) and where their legal authority would come from (would the courts uphold a national rent control law?). But these deeper questions about the kind of housing market voters might want seem worth hashing out, regardless of those other details. Mr. Orton, the Sanders adviser, pushed back against the logic of  economists  that, for one, rent control discourages developers from building and landlords from renting housing that Americans badly need. “I would say to those economists, how is that working out?” he said of the current deference to the market. “That’s what we’ve been doing. When we’ve left this to private developers, everything from the crash of the housing market to how we’ve seen gentrification just explode in some of the most vulnerable communities, to how we’ve seen people priced out of what would normally be affordable housing — this current crisis is the result of that.”"
"Presidential hopeful Joe Biden says he has never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. He calls on President Trump to release the transcript of his call with the Ukraine. Former Vice President Joe Biden  went on the offense Saturday over  President Trump’s July phone call  with the president of Ukraine, in which Trump reportedly urged the leader to investigate Biden’s son’s dealings in the country -- with Biden backing calls for a House investigation and for the White House to release the transcript of the call. “Trump’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum, and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,” he told reporters in Iowa. NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his role as VP in pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as vice president, worked to protect the company from investigation. On Saturday, Biden said that he had never spoken to Hunter about his business dealings in Ukraine, and backed calls for the House to investigate -- as well as suggesting it could begin a path to impeachment. “Depending on what the House finds, he could be impeached but I’m not making that judgment now,” he said. “The House should investigate it, this appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power.” He went on to call Trump a “serial abuser.” “He abuses power everywhere he can and if he sees any threat to staying in power, he’ll do whatever he has to do -- but this crosses the line,” he said. CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT Biden’s remarks came just hours after Trump dismissed the controversy as a “Ukraine Witch Hunt” being stoked by the Democratic Party and the “fake news media,” and said that the real scandal was to do with Biden’s interactions in the country. “The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won’t get a very large amount of U.S. money, so they fabricate a.story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine,” he tweeted. “Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. The Fake News knows this but doesn’t want to report!” What initially touched off the  controversy is a secret  whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. Trump dismissed the story as “ridiculous"" and a ""partisan hack job"" from the Oval Office on Friday and said his calls with foreign leaders are “always appropriate.” The whistleblower complaint led House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democrats to call for an investigation and for the administration hand over the complaint as well as a transcript of the call -- even as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire declined to share details with lawmakers. Maguire is expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. after being subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee. Schiff had accused Maguire of withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioned whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On Saturday Trump said that the media was turning the story into one about him, as they are trying to “protect” the Democratic frontrunner. “Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden,” he tweeted. “Will fail again!” Fox News' Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"The Democratic field got a little bit smaller this week,  shrinking to 19 candidates . Here’s our weekly catch-up on the  2020 election  and some moments you may have missed. ‘Clearly not my time’ Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who entered the Democratic presidential race on the hopes that his brand of urban progressive leadership could appeal on a national scale,  said on Friday that he was ending his candidacy . Breaking: Bill de Blasio announces he is ending his presidential campaign  pic.twitter.com/vL8GcX3xV5 — Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe)  September 20, 2019 
 Mr. de Blasio’s campaign never quite caught on, and his announcement came less than two weeks before the qualification deadline for the  October debate . His inclusion in the event was growing less likely by the day.  “I feel like I’ve contributed all I can to this primary campaign, and it’s clearly not my time,” he said in an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “I’m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City, and I’m going to keep speaking up for working people.” Read more about  Mr. de Blasio’s exit here .  And here’s  our magazine piece  about his journey from progressive hope to punching bag. A big day for Warren  Monday was big for Senator  Elizabeth Warren  of Massachusetts.  She  received the endorsement of the Working Families Party , a labor-aligned progressive group that endorsed Senator  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont  during the last presidential cycle .  She released a 6,000-word  anti-corruption plan , which would make the release of tax returns automatic for candidates for federal office, make it illegal for elected officials to become lobbyists and strengthen ethics requirements for federal judges.  And in a speech at a rally in Manhattan that drew thousands to Washington Square Park, she forcefully attacked corruption and invoked the power of women to bring about sweeping change.  Ms. Warren delivered the speech blocks from the site of the  Triangle shirtwaist factory fire  of 1911, which killed 146 garment workers, most of them immigrant women. It was one of the deadliest industrial disasters in the nation’s history. “The tragic story of the Triangle factory fire is a story about power,” Ms. Warren said. “A story of what happens when the rich and the powerful take control of government and use it to increase their own profits while they stick it to working people. But what happened in the aftermath of the fire is a different story about power — a story about our power, a story about what’s possible when we fight together as one.” Our colleague Alexander Burns noted that in dueling speeches Monday night, Ms. Warren and President Trump  laid out competing visions of populism . Sanders shakes up his operation With five months to go before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Sanders  overhauled his operations in the state , which he won by more than 22 percentage points in 2016.  Mr. Sanders, who hails from neighboring Vermont, almost certainly must win New Hampshire again next year to have a chance at the nomination. The campaign also parted ways with its political director in Iowa,  according to a report  that surfaced later in the week.  Read more  about that move here. ‘A sham process’: Democrats call for Kavanaugh’s impeachment Several candidates called for the impeachment of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh after The New York Times published  new information  about allegations of sexual misconduct against him. Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Senator Kamala Harris of California were among those who called for the justice’s impeachment. “He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice,” Ms. Harris wrote. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called the revelations “profoundly troubling” but stopped short of demanding impeachment. Instead, he called for an investigation into “whether the Trump administration and Senate Republicans pressured the F.B.I. to ignore evidence.” Read  our full report  on the calls for impeachment. Regulating marijuana like alcohol Former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas  released a plan  on Thursday to legalize marijuana, expunge all possession convictions and regulate the substance the way alcohol is regulated. Sales would be limited to adults, smoking would be banned in public areas, and advertising would be restricted.  He also wants to tax the marijuana industry and invest the revenue in the communities of color disproportionately affected by the war on drugs.  Every Democratic candidate supports decriminalizing marijuana, and most, including Mr. O’Rourke, support full legalization. But six candidates — Mr. Biden, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., and former Representative Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania — want to leave the question of legalization up to the states. In other policy news: Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey  unveiled a plan  to bolster workers’ rights. It would protect the right to organize for all workers, including those in the gig economy; end anti-union “right-to-work” laws; and change the way capital gains are taxed. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., released  a disaster preparedness plan  to help communities prepare for and recover from storms. It aims to improve coordination between federal agencies and storm victims, fortify infrastructure and strengthen the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Mr. Buttigieg also detailed his  “Medicare for All Who Want It” plan , which seeks to ensure universal access to coverage by allowing all Americans to opt in to a public-coverage alternative.  Mr. Sanders  introduced a $2.5 trillion housing proposal  that calls for more public and affordable housing,  as well as a national rent control law  that would cap annual rent increases at 3 percent or one and a half times the inflation rate, whichever was higher.  Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund executive, released a  “justice-centered climate plan ,” which he said would create nearly   46 million jobs over 10 years. He also promised to create a civilian climate corps as part of a broad  “national service plan ,” which would aim for a million annual participants by 2025.  And finally ... Overheard on the campaign trail? “I’m moving to Iowa,”  Ms. Harris joked in a comment   to Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii that included an expletive and was overheard by a reporter. The state of California did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Ms. Harris’s remark came as  her campaign announced a new push in the state . In a call with reporters Thursday morning, aides said they hoped to position Ms. Harris for a late-breaking Iowa surge. And they set a firm target: a top-three finish. Ms. Harris’s team sent out a fund-raising email based on her quip. And, of course,  there are already T-shirts . "
"McAleenan called white supremacist extremism is one of the most ""potent ideologies"" driving acts violence in the US.  ""In our modern age, the continued menace of racially based violent extremism, particularly white supremacist extremism, is an abhorrent affront to the nation, the struggle and unity of its diverse population,"" he said in a speech at the Brookings Institution. He pointed to the attacks in  Poway ,  El Paso ,  Pittsburgh  and  Charleston , saying they were motivated by various extremist ideologies, including ""very concerningly and increasingly, white supremacist violent extremism."" According to McAleenan, ISIS and al Qaeda remain the ""two most pressing radical Islamist terrorist threats"" to the US with potential to direct plots and also to inspire homegrown violent extremism in their name.  The strategic announcement  comes just days after a judge ruled  that the American Airlines mechanic accused of trying to sabotage a commercial airliner before takeoff will be held in custody until trial. The judge said during a bond hearing that Ahmed Alani, who allegedly tried to damage or disable an aircraft's air data module system, ""may be very sympathetic to terrorists.""  Alani has been charged with ""willfully damaging, destroying, disabling, or wrecking an aircraft, and attempting to do so,"" according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court earlier this month. No terror-related charges have been filed. President Donald Trump has been criticized for not condemning white supremacy strongly enough, with some accusing him of exacerbating the problem.  Earlier this month, former Vice President Joe Biden connected Trump's rhetoric with the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, saying in a speech that the President has ""fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation."" In August,  CNN reported that White House officials rebuffed efforts  by their colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a year to make combating domestic terror threats, such as those from white supremacists, a greater priority as specifically spelled out in the National Counterterrorism Strategy, sources told CNN. Last October, the  White House unveiled its national counterterrorism strategy , which offered a broad strokes blueprint for how the Trump administration will and already has approached the threat of terrorism, from targeting terrorists at their source to beefing up efforts domestically to tackle the threat of homegrown terrorism.  Recently-ousted national security adviser John Bolton described the new strategy at the time as a sharp departure from President Barack Obama's approach to confronting terrorism, emphasizing the Trump administration's recognition of the threat as one rooted in radical Islamist ideology. ""Radical Islamist terrorist groups still represent the preeminent threat to the United States,"" Bolton said. ""We recognize that there is a terrorist ideology that we're confronting. And I think it's long been the President's view that without recognizing that we're in an ideological struggle, that we can't properly address the terrorist threat."""
"WEBSTER CITY, Iowa — Iowa’s presidential caucuses disenfranchise huge blocs of voters. The state is 91 percent white. It is not easy to get to, or get around in. But to a greater degree than in recent campaigns, this unrepresentative and idiosyncratic state is proving that it is the only electoral battleground that matters for Democrats from now until caucus night on Feb. 3.  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign said it would have 110 staff members in the state by the end of this month. Senator Kamala Harris has promised to visit every week in October. Mayor Pete Buttigieg on Sunday kicked off a John McCain-like, everything-on-the-record bus tour and is advertising on local television and radio. Senator Amy Klobuchar is 49 counties into her tour of all 99 in the state. And on Monday, Senator Bernie Sanders will begin a “Bernie Beats Trump’’ tour of eastern Iowa to highlight what he says is his strength as a general election candidate. As  a new poll suggested a significant shift  in the primary race’s top tier — with Senator Elizabeth Warren overtaking Mr. Biden for first place — candidates at the annual Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines on Saturday tried to cut through  the furor surrounding President Trump, Ukraine and Mr. Biden  to deliver their message to voters still sifting through their preferences from one of the largest fields in history. The candidates’ renewed sense of  urgency  has set the stage for a four-month sprint to a night of caucuses that remains the single biggest prize in American politics. “We know that Iowa is where we can turn heads,’’ Mr. Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., said aboard his campaign bus on Sunday. “Even the other early states will be looking at what Iowa did.” The increasing focus on Iowa, where voters must attend an hourslong midwinter evening gathering to participate in choosing their party’s nominee, has come at the expense of New Hampshire, where the nation’s first primary election comes eight days later.  None of the Democratic presidential candidates are betting their entire campaigns on a strong performance in New Hampshire, meaning it may be the first time since 1984 that there is not a candidate focused solely on the Granite State in a contested presidential race. With so many candidates running, much remains unsettled. And both Iowa and New Hampshire have a history of lifting underdog candidates, with John Kerry rising from the single digits to a caucus victory in 2004 and Bill Clinton declaring himself the “comeback kid” when he finished second in New Hampshire’s 1992 primary contest.  Yet those examples, like others often cited by this year’s back-of-the-pack candidates, took place before presidential campaigns had become entirely nationalized. Nowadays, Democrats at campaign rallies in rural Iowa are more likely to recite talking points they have heard on cable news or social media than something they read in their local newspaper.  Collectively, the 10 Democrats who appeared on the debate stage in Houston this month have spent more than twice as much money on Facebook advertisements targeted to Iowans since June 29 than to people in New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, according to data from Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic political firm. No candidate in the race has a bigger chasm between online investments in the first two nominating states than Ms. Harris, of California, who since June 29 has spent $115,178 on Facebook ads in Iowa, but just $2,164 on such ads in New Hampshire. After some grumbling that she had gone more than a month since last visiting the state, Ms. Harris was overheard last week saying she was “moving to Iowa,” with an expletive added for emphasis. Her team announced last week that it would add 60 new staff members and open 10 new offices, and she plans to return weekly until Halloween. Her campaign manager told reporters she was aiming for a “top three” finish in the state. The historically large field has left even the candidates unclear about how many Democrats will have a plausible claim to continue on to New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Ms. Harris called a third place showing a goal but said she did not know if a failure to meet that threshold would doom her campaign. “I honestly don’t know,” she said in an interview before a campaign stop on Friday in Cedar Falls. “I think it will be a confluence of factors that ultimately decides how long anyone stays in and what that means.” A new poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN, released on Saturday night, showed a reordering of the Democratic field. For the first time in The Register’s poll this year, Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, at 22 percent support, led Mr. Biden, who the survey found was the first choice of 20 percent of would-be caucusgoers. Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, placed third, at 11 percent, with Mr. Buttigieg at 9 percent and Ms. Harris at 6 percent.  “This is the first major shake-up” of the race, The Register’s pollster, Ann Selzer,  told the paper .  The poll found that just one in five likely caucusgoers said they had made up their minds, and 63 percent could still be persuaded to shift their support to someone else. Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, who was tied for sixth in the poll, said after presiding over the opening of a new campaign office on Friday in Cedar Rapids that there might be more than twice as many tickets out of Iowa as usual. “You could be No. 6,” Ms. Klobuchar said before the poll results were announced. “I’m really serious, in a 20-person field and people will go, ‘Not bad.’ They’re going to look at who is in the top eight.” Mr. Buttigieg predicted a smaller number of candidates would survive Iowa. “I don’t know how many people can emerge, I think that comes down to how many people voters can keep track of,” he said. “I’d be shocked if it’s more than five.” At the moment, all of the Democratic candidates are chasing Ms. Warren. She is drawing the largest crowds in the field — 2,000 came to see her on Thursday night in Iowa City, two hours after and three miles away from a stop by Ms. Harris in Coralville that drew about 200 to a brewery. Ms. Warren declined on Sunday to take a victory lap over her new Iowa polling standing.  “I don’t do polls,” she said in Detroit,  where she marched with striking autoworkers outside a General Motors plant . “We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.”  A cadre of challengers to Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren are augmenting their Iowa operations, adding staff, opening new offices, collecting endorsements and starting new fund-raising appeals as they aim to create the aura of momentum while building organizations to turn out supporters for the state’s Feb. 3 caucuses. Ms. Klobuchar, from neighboring Minnesota,  has support from more current and former Iowa state lawmakers  than any other 2020 presidential candidate, according to Iowa Starting Line, a local political news website. And Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who tied with Ms. Klobuchar in The Register’s poll, issued an S.O.S. to supporters over the weekend, saying that without an infusion of $1.7 million by the end of the month his campaign might no longer be viable.  While Democrats elsewhere in the country, representing a national party that is increasingly diverse, offer quadrennial grumbling about Iowa, officials here aim to use their status to force the presidential candidates to focus on local issues. J. D. Scholten, a Democrat running for the seat held by Representative Steve King in a 39-county section of northwest Iowa, said he will soon schedule campaign stops across his district with each of the presidential campaigns in towns of 1,000 people or less to test their appeal to rural voters.  “I really want to see the engagement,” Mr. Scholten said at the steak fry on Saturday, which drew a crowd of more than 12,000 people. “I think that’s where I’ll see. No polling can tell me, nothing like that. I want to see whether the people’s heads nod or not.” Lisa Lerer contributed reporting from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Stephanie Saul from Detroit."

Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has suggested that Joe Biden, the current frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, worked while he was vice president to protect his son's company from being investigated.

"DES MOINES — Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is the new Iowa polling leader, narrowly in first place ahead of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to a new poll of the state from  The Des Moines Register and CNN . The poll showed that Ms. Warren was the first choice for 22 percent of would-be Democratic caucusgoers, a significant increase from the 15 percent support she held in June,  when The Register last polled the state . Mr. Biden dropped from a first-place June showing of 24 percent to 20 percent.  The result left the two in a statistical tie, well ahead of the rest of the pack. The poll is the latest evidence of Ms. Warren’s political rise in the 2020 race. Alone among the 2020 candidates, her campaign stops have become bona fide events, with 20,000 people attending a speech in Manhattan this week and 2,000 turning out in Iowa City on Thursday night. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont placed third with 11 percent, the second consecutive poll from The Register in which his campaign has seen precipitous decreases in support. Mr. Sanders, who placed in a statistical tie with Hillary Clinton in the state’s 2016 contest, had 25 percent support in the paper’s March poll and 16 percent support in June.  Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., placed fourth in The Register’s poll, with 9 percent. He had 14 percent in The Register’s June poll and has fallen in other surveys of the state since then before launching a television advertising campaign here after Labor Day. The gains by Ms. Warren come largely at the expense of Mr. Sanders. His polling drop-off comes as his campaign has reordered staff in early nominating states in an effort to reboot his campaign.  Senator Kamala Harris of California was fifth overall with 6 percent support. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota each had 3 percent support. Four candidates were the first choice of 2 percent of likely Iowa caucusgoers.  In addition to leading the field, Ms. Warren also has the most room for growth in the field — 71 percent of Democrats surveyed said she was their first or second choice or they were open to backing her,  the poll found . Mr. Biden was next, being considered by 60 percent of Iowa Democrats. Of the rest of the field, only Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Harris were being considered by more than half the Democratic electorate.  The dynamics are far from set: Just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers said their minds were made up, and 63 percent said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. The poll surveyed 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers by telephone Sept. 14-18, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. It was released after 17 Democratic presidential candidates appeared Saturday at the Polk County Steak Fry, an annual political event that drew 12,000 activists and voters to a Des Moines park for several hours of political speeches, campaign singalongs and freshly grilled meats. The poll, like the Steak Fry event, illustrated the increasingly condensed nature of the 2020 Democratic presidential contest. The poll found just five candidates registering more than 3 percent support, while those who braved the drizzling conditions and threat of thunderstorms congregated around the candidates who emerged hours later atop the polls. The event’s largest applause came for Ms. Warren, who repeated a forceful call for President Trump’s impeachment, and Mr. Buttigieg, who was followed by a yellow-clad cadre of highly enthusiastic supporters. Mr. Biden, whose campaign purchased the largest allotment of Steak Fry tickets, entered the event with a marching band and scores of campaign aides and volunteers. The lower-polling contenders for the most part roamed the grounds of  Water Works  Park here unencumbered. Mr. Biden was not the only candidate bringing some flash to the event. Supporters of the former housing secretary Julián Castro danced to a mariachi band, backers of former Representative Beto O’Rourke pushed a boat out into the nearby lake, Ms. Warren took 1,050 selfies and Ms. Klobuchar blasted the music of Prince, a  Minnesota hero.  For some, the event may mark one of their last major appearances in the state. Mr. Booker sent out a plea to donors today saying that unless he raises $1.7 million over the next 10 days, he will be unable to remain in the race. He’s not alone in being in danger of running out of cash."
"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 22 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com U.S. Rep.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  has apparently reached a boiling point over moderate  House Democrats ’ caution regarding the prospect of impeaching  President Trump . The go-slow approach is personified by House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi , with whom Ocasio-Cortez has had an often contentious relationship since the freshman lawmaker arrived in Washington just eight months ago. The New York Democrat told her more than 5 million Twitter followers late Saturday that the Democrats’ “refusal” to seek the removal of the president was a “bigger national scandal” than what she alleged was the president’s “lawbreaking behavior.” JUSTIN HASKINS: ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ PROVES AGAIN SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT Calls for impeachment have grown louder from some Democrats in the wake of last week’s news that a purported “ whistleblower ” had expressed concern about a phone call said to have taken place between President Trump and the leader of  Ukraine , in which Trump allegedly sought information about 2020 Democratic frontrunner  Joe Biden , whose son Hunter Biden  had business dealings  in Ukraine.  Soon after Ocasio-Cortez posted her Saturday comment, she received a response from James Fallows, the noted author, journalist and former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, who asserted that Ocasio-Cortez was overstating the case in criticizing members of her own party for exercising restraint regarding impeachment. LEADING HOUSE DEM TELLS PARTY NOT TO BE 'HASTY' IN PURSUING WHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGATIONS “IMO, this is ‘false equivalence’ of its own sort,” Fallows wrote. “What Trump is doing remains objectively the biggest threat, scandal, and problem. “Second-ranking: the silent acquiescence of the GOP Senate. “Then: it’s time for the House to act.” Ocasio Cortez doubled down in her response to Fallows. “It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law,” she wrote. “It’s another to let him. “The integrity of our democracy isn’t threatened when a president breaks the law. It’s threatened when we do nothing about it. “The GOP’s silence & refusal to act shouldn’t be a surprise. Ours is.” Ocasio-Cortez’s online outburst followed remarks earlier in the day by fellow progressive and 2020 presidential candidate Sen.  Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., who took a veiled shot at Pelosi, the standard-bearer among Democrats of a “wait and see” approach regarding potential action against the president. ""Donald Trump did everything he could to obstruct justice,” Warren said at an event in Iowa. “I read all 448 pages [of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Russia investigation] and when I got to the end, I called for the impeachment of Donald Trump. “ Congress failed to act ,” Warren added, “and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system.” Just over a week ago, Pelosi had  lashed out at reporters  when they repeatedly asked her about impeachment at a news conference. “Impeachment is a very divisive measure,” a clearly frustrated Pelosi said, “but if we have to go there, we have to go there and we can't go there unless we have the facts. And we’ll follow the facts and follow the obstruction the president is making ... and make a decision when we’re ready. “That’s the only question, that’s all I’m going to say about this subject, and there's nothing different from one day to the next,” she added. The struggles experienced by the 79-year-old Pelosi, a three-decade member of Congress from California, have included frequent clashes with Ocasio-Cortez, 29, and other progressive – and aggressive – young lawmakers who were swept into office during last year’s midterm elections. The progressives’ push for far-left policies, including Ocasio-Cortez’s  Green New Deal , as well as their vocal opposition to President Trump, have been at odds with the moderates’ typically lower-key approach to getting things done. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a  closed-door meeting in July , in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. The meeting was soon followed by the  departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff , Saikat Chakrabarti. But with Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter posts that began late Saturday, it appears the truce with Pelosi – at least regarding impeachment – may be over.

"Now the future of those benefits is at the heart of an emerging split among  2020 Democratic candidates  over how to remake American health care. Former Vice President Joe Biden says union members shouldn't have to give up their employer plans if they like them, while Sen. Bernie Sanders is arguing that union workers would still come out ahead under ""Medicare for All,"" which would shift all Americans into a government-run plan. The fight puts Sanders, a declared democratic socialist, at odds with some in the labor movement, where many union workers already have insurance with pretty good benefits. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is also seeking the nomination, is in a similar situation because of her support for both Medicare for All and organized labor. Already, there's a growing divide among unions as to whether to back Sanders' universal coverage proposal. National Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses, are very vocal supporters of Medicare for All. But the International Association of Fire Fighters opposes  eliminating employer-based coverage . Still other unions, such as the Service Employees International Union, say they support all efforts to expand coverage to more people. Roughly 10.5% of workers -- or 14.7 million people -- were union members in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about half the share that were unionized 35 years earlier. Some 95% of union workers had access to employer medical benefits in 2019, compared to 68% of non-union workers, according to the bureau's data. And they were more likely to participate in the plans, with 84% of union staffers signing up, compared to 54% of their non-union counterparts.  ""Bargaining for health benefits is a distinguishing characteristic that labor unions hold out as an important variable as to why you would want to be a union member,"" said David Brenner, national director of multi-employer consulting at Segal Consulting, a leader in the field.  The quality of their health plans varies widely, experts said. Unions that cover a lot of lower-wage employees, such as custodians or nurse's aides, may have more basic benefits and have to pay more for them. But other unions, including those in the construction,  auto industry and some hotel trades, have more generous policies -- with low premiums, deductibles and co-pays. A few have even set up their own health clinics for members to get care. Many health packages are so comprehensive that unions feared getting hit with the Affordable Care Act's Cadillac tax, which would have slapped a levy on the value of employer-provided coverage above a certain threshold. Companies and unions quickly banded together to fight it, fearing they'd have to curtail workers' health benefits. The implementation date has been delayed twice, and the House recently voted to  repeal the provision . The United Auto Workers, who are currently striking against General Motors, are among the unions with high-quality plans. Members pay only about 3% of the total cost of their health care, while salaried staffers have to cover about one-third, according to GM. Until recently, the automaker had been seeking to shift more of the bill to the UAW workforce. But GM has dropped its request for major changes in the health care plan. Talks are now hung up on other issues, including pay, the use of temporary workers and a union demand to shift work from Mexico to facilities slated to close in the US. However, GM has also  stopped paying for health insurance  for the striking workers, who will have to sign up for COBRA. The UAW's strike fund is picking up the cost. Sanders took the opportunity earlier this week to note that  union members wouldn't have to fear  losing their benefits during strikes under Medicare for All. Medical benefits is a central component of most contract negotiations. Health care is a major expense for most companies, and they have been pushing more of the cost onto non-union employees for years. They want organized labor to contribute more too. But union workers are willing to make sacrifices to shield their health care coverage, including curtailing raises or other benefits. ""In an awful lot of cases, workers are forgoing any increase in wages in order to keep their deductibles from going even higher,"" said Tom Leibfried, legislative representative for the AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 national and international labor unions that represent 12.5 million people. There's also a growing trend of contract talks breaking down in part over health benefits, said Alex Colvin, dean of Cornell University's ILR School, formerly known as the School of Industrial and Labor Relations. Health coverage was among the issues in United Steelworkers' strike against National Grid in Massachusetts and the teachers' strike in West Virginia last year. ""There's a lot more labor unrest and the cost of health care is one of the drivers of that,"" Brenner said. Health care is important to union workers for several reasons, said Shaun Richman, program director at the SUNY Empire State College's School of Labor Studies who also was a deputy director of organizing for the American Federation of Teachers. ""You can take a higher raise to the bank, but when your kid gets sick, the peace of mind of good health insurance is important,"" Richman said. Also, ""it's a badge of honor of maintaining the health insurance and not taking concessions on it.""  Recognizing that he needs unions' support, Sanders issued a  Workplace Democracy plan  last month that would require companies to pass along savings resulting from Medicare for All to workers in the form of raises or other benefits. Unions would be allowed to maintain their clinics and provide supplemental coverage, as long as it doesn't duplicate the benefits available under Medicare for All. A Warren aide told CNN recently that the campaign is talking with labor leaders about how unions with negotiated health care plans will be guaranteed a chance to rework their agreements during a Medicare for All transition. That may not be enough for some unions, though. ""There has to be a role for the hard-fought, high-quality plans that we've negotiated,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told Fox News earlier this month. ""If there isn't some way for us to have our plans integrated into the system, then we would have a hard time supporting it."""
"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com The University of  Iowa  has reopened an investigation into allegations by members of the school's marching band that they were verbally abused and physically assaulted during last weekend's game against rival  Iowa State  University. Members of the Hawkeye Marching Band allege that they were subjected to racial slurs and other verbal abuse, and sexual harassment before, during and after the game. Two band members told the  Cedar Rapids Gazette  that a third band member, a woman was hospitalized with fractured ribs.

       Administrators at the two schools announced earlier in the week that they had looked into the allegations, but they didn't say whether anyone would face punishment. Iowa's athletic director, Gary Barta, and his Iowa State counterpart, Jamie Pollard, released a joint statement saying members of both schools' bands had been subjected to ""rude, vulgar, and in some cases violent"" conduct at football games in recent years, and urging fans to stop the behavior. FOOTBALL FAN WHO REQUESTED BEER MONEY ON TV REVEALS HE'S RAISED $820G FOR CHILDREN'S CHARITY In response, 21-year-old Corey Knopp, who plays tenor sax for the Iowa Marching Band, posted his account of the abuse following the game, which Iowa won 18-17. ""People were physically assaulted,"" Knopp said. ""We expect to get booed and cussed at. But never for violence to take place...Put yourself in our shoes. Kids. Marching in formation back to our busses after a long day. Getting shoved and having beer cans shaken and sprayed at our feet. Getting slapped because of the words on our uniform (IOWA). Getting pushed so hard that someone’s (not going to name this person) ribs are broken. That is completely unacceptable."" BERNIE SANDERS' IOWA POLITICAL DIRECTOR HAS LEFT CAMPAIGN, REPORTS SAY Knopp also detailed to the Gazette how an Iowa State fan shoved him as they were marching back to the team buses. ""He decided to cut through the band and shoved me out of his way. I yelled, ‘Do not put your hands on me sir,’ and he yelled back, ‘F--k you.’” Nathan Topping, a 19-year-old trumpet player, told the Gazette a full beer bottle was thrown at him, causing what he described as a ""nasty bruise."" ""It was the fans,"" said Paige Pearson, 20, who plays trumpet in the Iowa band. ""The Iowa State band has been nothing but kind. They've reached out to us and said sorry this happened. It was not even the students, but adult fans."" University of Iowa spokeswoman Jeneane Beck said Friday that the social media posts made it clear that the university hadn’t adequately conveyed to its students what it had done to address the band members’ concerns, the Gazette reported. “Student safety is our number one priority and we are committed to ensuring a safe experience on game day for our students,” Beck said. “Additionally we are continuing our investigation to ensure all of our students have the ability to share their experiences with the appropriate authorities.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Iowa officials said Friday in a message to band members that Barta and Pollard “have been actively engaged in the process and have publicly pledged to ensure better protections for students moving forward.” The Associated Press contributed to this report. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Saturday dismissed news reports that he  urged the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son  as little more than a “witch hunt” and said his dealings were “perfectly fine” and routine. “Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He said that any effort to investigate him would fail, comparing it to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into his ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign. The news reports he was referring to have revealed the existence of a secret whistle-blower complaint that is believed to have been filed, at least partly, in response to Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The New York Times  reported  Friday that Mr. Trump, in a July call, pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Biden’s son, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Mr. Trump, intensifying a line of attack he and his allies have stoked for months, said the real problem was Mr. Biden, who according to most polls is the leading candidate in a crowded Democratic field and has framed himself as the most likely to defeat Mr. Trump in the general election. “The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,” Mr. Trump wrote, “so they fabricate a story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine.” No evidence  has surfaced to bolster Mr. Trump’s claim that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor general’s dismissal. Another tweet from Mr. Trump , which featured his campaign’s phone number, included a series of video clips featuring journalists, including some from The New York Times, discussing Mr. Biden and Ukraine on television news programs. Citing the reports by journalists seemed ironic given the president’s claim that the media had not reported on Mr. Biden. But the tweets signaled that Mr. Trump and his campaign organization would be doing as much as possible to sow doubt about Mr. Biden. Friday’s reports on the president drew strong reactions from top Democrats and, for some, brought a new urgency to calls for Mr. Trump’s impeachment. “There is no bottom. Impeach him,” Beto O’Rourke said on Friday evening. And Joe Walsh, a former congressman from Illinois who has launched a long-shot challenge to Mr. Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, urged others in his party who were alarmed by the president’s behavior to come forward. “He doesn’t believe in the rule of law,” Mr. Walsh wrote on Twitter on Saturday morning. “He abuses his power whenever he wants. He lies at will. He doesn’t know the meaning of checks & balances. And he sees nothing wrong with telling a foreign government to dig up dirt on his opponents. Come on Republicans. Be better than this.” Although Mr. Mueller wrote in his report that he found “insufficient evidence” to accuse the president or his advisers of a criminal conspiracy with the Russians, his investigators said his campaign welcomed Moscow’s intereference and expected to benefit from it. Democrats are using Mr. Mueller’s findings as part of the basis for their impeachment inquiry. Mr. Biden, for his part, has dismissed the president’s attacks. “If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country,” he said in a statement released after The Times and other new organizations, including The Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, reported Mr. Trump’s conversations with Mr. Zelensky. “This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes.” For years,  the Bidens have faced questions  about the association of Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, with one of Ukraine’s largest natural gas companies, and whether or not there was any connection to Mr. Biden’s efforts as vice president to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor whose office had authority over investigations of the oligarch whose company paid his son. Mr. Biden’s son earned as much as $50,000 per month in some months for his work for the company, Burisma Holdings. This year, the current Ukrainian prosecutor general reopened an investigation into Burisma just as Mr. Biden began  his 2020 presidential campaign ."
"There was a lot of drama. Senator Cory Booker, by way of greeting, lifted one of the moderators of Friday night’s  L.G.B.T.Q. Presidential Forum  right off the floor in a great bear hug. Later, an audience member interrupted Senator Amy Klobuchar with what sounded like an appeal to “protect sex workers.” And then there was Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who was asked what it would feel like to serve as president of a country for which he could not, under current regulations, donate his blood. But the most breathtaking moment, by my reckoning, belonged to Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said that she wasn’t just going to tell us what she’d do in her first 100 days. She would show us. And then she read aloud the names of the  18 transgender women of color  who have been murdered this year, in a voice that quavered with emotion. “It is time,” she concluded, “for a president of the United States of America to say their names.” Those names are Dana Martin, Jazzaline Ware, Ashanti Carmon, Claire Legato,  Muhlaysia Booker , Michelle Tamika Washington, Paris Cameron,  Chynal Lindsey , Chanel Scurlock, Zoe Spears, Brooklyn Lindsey, Denali Berries Stuckey, Kiki Fantroy, Pebbles LaDime “Dime” Doe, Tracy Single, Bailey Reeves, Bee Love Slater, and  Ja’leyah-Jamar . It was a historic night — the first time candidates for president have been brought together to discuss queer issues, in an event sponsored by  The Gazette , the  Advocate ,  One Iowa , and  GLAAD  (the L.G.B.T.Q. nonprofit which I served as national co-chair for four years). Cory Booker was the star of the first hour. After he bear-hugged  Zach Stafford , the editor of the Advocate, he gave a speech that was, for all its brevity, a barn burner. “You cannot lead the people,” he said, “if you do not love the people.” Meanwhile, as an older American — and one from Pennsylvania at that — I have a longtime affection for former Vice President Joe Biden, a fondness that has occasionally put me at odds with a younger generation of queer activists. I had hoped that Biden’s appearance at the forum would finally put to rest the uncertainty around his candidacy. That didn’t happen. Instead, — I’m so sorry to have to say this — he appeared, once again, to be  phoning it in . He said a few passionate but circuitous words as he stepped onto the stage, then looked over at the host, Lyz Lenz, an Iowa-based writer. “Do I go sit down?” he asked. She nodded. “Honestly, I thought you’d go a little longer.” Later, when she asked about Biden’s description of Mike Pence as “a decent guy,” he just looked at her and said, “You’re a lovely person.” Backstage, Lenz said, Biden had called her “sweetheart.” It may well be that this was, once again, just Joe being Joe. But — to put it mildly — he’s wearing me down. He has to do better. Pete Buttigieg had a good night; so did Julián Castro. Senator Kamala Harris did well enough, but I had hoped she’d show some of the grace and magic on display in the first debate. That didn’t happen, either. There were three losers of the forum, all Republicans: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, and the president himself. Many of the candidates took special note to lament the actions of the trio: DeVos, for  refusing to investigate complaints  by trans students in schools; Carson for his  horrific description  of trans women this week as “big hairy men;” and Donald Trump for pretty much everything: for the damage his administration has done to queer America, and for his passion, as abetted by Russian trolls, for pitting us against one another. Another loser last night was Senator Bernie Sanders, who did not show. There’s  a second forum  coming up in October, sponsored by U.C.L.A. and the Human Rights Campaign. Sanders isn’t going to that one, either. His campaign cites scheduling conflicts. Some of the other winners weren’t candidates. Angelica Ross, the chief moderator, was poised and fierce; you could make the case that she was more electrifying than any of people actually in the race. The sponsors of the event had a lot to celebrate as well, just for the fact of pulling this whole thing off. GLAAD’s chief executive,  Sarah Kate Ellis , provided a poised, articulate keynote as the evening began. As I listened to her, it occurred to me — and not for the first time — that I wouldn’t mind it one bit if she ran for president herself. Which is more than I can say about some people. But it was Warren and Booker who shone brightest. Warren, when asked about some Americans objecting to the morality of queer lives, responded with the parable in Matthew 25 about the sheep and the goats. “Whatever you have done for the least of my brothers and sisters,” she read, quoting Christ, “you did for me.” I would hope that this passage from Scripture gives Mike Pence something to think about. Booker, in making an appeal for a revival of civic grace, was nothing short of inspirational. Is this the moment he breaks out of the middle of the pack, and rises into the top tier? We’ll know soon enough. “What does love look like in public?” he asked. “It looks like justice.” The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters  to the editor.

"The Wall Street Journal reports that in a July phone call, President Trump repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son. President Trump  faced fresh calls for impeachment on Friday after a new report claimed Trump asked the president of Ukraine numerous times in a single phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. Biden said on Friday that the claim has no credibility. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary  Julian Castro , a  2020 candidate , responded to the report by calling Trump a ""criminal"" who need to be impeached ""immediately."" WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM Sen.

""This story is stunning and should be shaking Washington right now -- Donald Trump's moral vandalism disqualifies him from being president. As I've said before, it's time for impeachment proceedings,"" he tweeted. Fellow 2020 contender  Beto O'Rouke  had already called for impeachment in reaction to statements made by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's attorney, on Thursday night.

DEMOCRATS AREN'T ACTUALLY IMPEACHING THE PRESIDENT-- YET, BUT THEY ARE DIGGING DEEP Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, claimed the House had ""no choice"" but to impeach after the Journal's report surfaced. ""Everything Nixon did during Watergate pales in comparison to Trump using the power of the Presidency to pressure a foreign leader who needs U.S. Aid to investigate a political opponent,"" Pfeiffer said. The whistleblower controversy seemed to raise even more concerns among the 2020 field, many of whom already called for the president's impeachment. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , called on Friday for the whistleblower to come forward, offering protection as he defied the administration. She also suggested that Trump was trying to interfere in the 2020 election like, according to her, he did in 2016. ""He has openly invited interference and now we have information that suggests that again, he is engaged in that kind of behavior,"" she said at a campaign stop. ""What he fails to understand is that he is the President of the United States and that office ... is the people's office -- not his office,"" she added. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., didn't directly address the report on Twitter but did dispute Trump's attorneys' claims that he couldn't be criminally prosecuted. ""Yes, he can,"" she tweeted on Friday after the Journal's report surfaced. Trump, for his part, has denied any wrongdoing.

"David Webb, Donna Brazile and A.B. Stoddard on whether not Joe Biden will win the African-American vote. Former Vice President Joe Biden will need to rely on ""older"" African-American voters if he hopes to win the White House in 2020, according to A.B. Stoddard. “This age divide in the African-American electorate is the crux of Joe Biden’s viability,” Stoddard told  “The Daily Briefing”  with Dana Perino. “If he loses older African-Americans along with his non-college white support, he won’t be the nominee,” she said. The comments came after The New York Times ran a column titled,  “Young Black Voters to Their Biden-Supporting Parents: ‘Is This Your King?”  The piece looked at views of younger black voters, which in many case differ from theirs of their older counterparts.

"Trump joined  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi   at a rally in Houston  attended by tens of thousands, many of whom were waving Indian flags as both leaders praised each other's work. Breaking away from the staid formality of meetings at the White House, Trump took the stage with Modi at an event dubbed ""Howdy, Modi!"" at NRG Stadium. Roughly 50,000 people -- many from the city's large Indian diaspora -- were registered to attend.     Trump credited the Indian-American community with ""helping to strengthen our country and build our future,"" citing its contributions to medicine, business and technology.  The President praised Modi's leadership and touted the ""stronger than ever before"" relationship with India. He said India ""has never had a better friend as President than President Donald Trump.""  Trump linked his concerns about security at the US-Mexico border with India's security concerns about its border with Pakistan. ""Both India and US also understand that to keep our communities safe, we must protect our borders,"" Trump said. The President addressed those affected by the serious flooding in Texas, and pledged the full support of his administration.  Modi praised Trump, calling him ""warm, friendly, accessible, energetic and full of wit.""  The Indian prime minister appealed directly to Trump's crowd-craving sensibilities with a large stadium event, giving Trump a rally setting where he tends to thrive and feel invigorated.  The rally gave Trump an opportunity to appeal to Indian-American voters in Harris County, which has been at the heart of Texas' gradual shift from reliably Republican to competitive battleground. Modi, who is set to attend the United Nations General Assembly this week, could help give Trump a bump in his battle for reelection.  On stage, Modi introduced Trump as India's ""true friend"" in the White House, and he invoked Trump in his signature campaign slogan, ""Ab ki baar, Modi sarkar,"" which translates to ""This time, Modi government."" On stage, Modi replaced his name with Trump's.  He commended the Trump administration for celebrating Diwali at the White House, and he invited Trump and his family to come to India.  Modi said he is ""certain that some positive developments"" will come out of upcoming talks at the UN. ""President Trump calls me the top negotiator but he himself is great at the 'Art of the deal' and I am learning a lot from him,"" he said.  The event was the first of two events on Sunday with foreign leaders in battleground states. After the rally, Trump flew to Wapakoneta, Ohio, to tour an Australian-owned cardboard manufacturing plant alongside Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who Trump feted with a state dinner on Friday. The events were an opportunity for both Modi and Morrison to show the US President they can deliver in ways that are especially appealing to Trump. In the critical battleground state of Ohio, Morrison was expected to demonstrate that his country is contributing to the US economy and creating manufacturing jobs as the two men tour a Pratt Industries manufacturing facility. The events come as Trump continues to  face questions about whether he pressured Ukraine's president  to investigate former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, while withholding military aid to the country. Trump has defended the call, dubbing criticism of it a ""Ukraine Witch Hunt,"" while Biden on Saturday  accused Trump of abusing the power of his presidency . There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump will cap off his Sunday travel with a flight to New York, where he will  address the United Nations General Assembly  later in the week and meet with world leaders on its sidelines."
"That call, which took place on July 25, one day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was also part of  a whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, the source added, a revelation that is likely to raise more questions in the ongoing controversy.  The Wall Street Journal  was first to report that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the July phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son Hunter, citing multiple people familiar with the matter.  The Journal also reported that Trump told Zelensky ""that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know"" whether allegations were true or not, one of the people said, according to the Journal.  Trump did not discuss a pending aid package to the country in the July 25 call, indicating that there may not have been an explicit quid pro quo outlined by the President in the conversation, the source familiar with the issue told CNN.  A readout of the call put out by the Ukrainian government says, ""Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA."" Joe Biden responded to the new revelations in a strongly-worded statement Friday.  ""If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump's willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation—a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia—pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor,"" Biden said.  ""Such clear-cut corruption damages and diminishes our institutions of government by making them tools of a personal political vendetta. At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress,"" he added. Trump downplays whistleblower's claims  Before the Journal's report was published, Trump downplayed the significance of the whistleblower complaint at the center of the latest controversy consuming Washington. During remarks in the Oval Office Friday, Trump claimed the whistleblower is partisan and his conversations with foreign leaders are ""appropriate."" But in a back-and-forth with reporters, Trump did not deny discussing Biden with Zelensky in that July phone call -- a potential subject for the complaint. ""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" Trump said prior to the Journal's report being published while appearing alongside the Australian Prime Minister, who he was hosting for a state visit. Precise details of the accusation aren't known, much to the chagrin of Democratic lawmakers, who have demanded more information. ""To ask a foreign leader to interfere in a presidential election - right after a year long investigation into potential foreign interference in a presidential election - would be pretty extraordinary. Even for these times,"" Connecticut Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy tweeted Friday in reaction to the news.   Trump admitted Friday he did not know the whistleblower's identity, and said he wasn't even sure if it was his conversation with Ukraine's leader that was the topic of the complaint. But he nevertheless appeared defensive about his interactions with Zelensky, with whom he will meet next week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Trump still pushing Biden claim Asked whether he'd discussed Biden with Ukraine's Zelensky during a phone call in late July, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed,"" but insisted that someone should look into Biden. ""It was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor's taken off the case,"" Trump said, appearing to refer to January remarks when Biden discussed his interactions with Ukraine's leadership when serving as vice president. Appearing  in a rambling interview on CNN on Thursday evening , Giuliani admitted he had discussed Biden with Ukraine's leaders during a visit to the country. Giuliani has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden's call in 2016 to remove the country's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company connected to Biden's son, Hunter. Other Western governments also called for that prosecutor's dismissal, and no evidence has indicated Biden's move was inappropriate. Ukraine's prosecutor general told Bloomberg in May he had no proof of wrongdoing by Biden or his son. Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian President has come under scrutiny from House investigators and they have demanded more information about Trump and Giuliani's interactions regarding Ukraine and the Biden matter, including calls for a transcript of Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president. Democrats are also looking for more information about the whistleblower's complaint. ""There's a real sense of urgency here since the Inspector General was so clear this is not something that can wait,"" said House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff on Friday, a day after his panel was briefed behind closed doors by the inspector general."
"Fox Nation host  Tomi Lahren  blasted the latest controversial proposal from 2020  Democratic  presidential candidate Bernie  Sanders , I-Vt., to spend a whopping $2.5 trillion to guarantee housing for every American. “Guaranteed housing, add that to the list of socialist agenda items that sound good to some, but in reality, are just big government solutions that move our nation away from freedom and closer to  socialism ,” said Lahren on  Fox Nation’s  “Final Thoughts.” TRUMP SAYS CALIFORNIA CITIES 'DESTROY THEMSELVES' WITH HOMELESSNESS On Wednesday, Sanders unveiled his “Housing for All” plan. The progressive senator said there’s a shortage of 7.4 million affordable homes for the lowest-income renters. And he stressed that more than 18 million families across the country are paying more than half of their limited incomes on housing and utilities. A spokesman for President Trump's reelection  campaign  called it ""yet another pie-in-the-sky, big government socialist promise by the Bernie camp."" Lahren panned the plan as “another giant, expensive federal program” and blasted Sanders’ plan to pay for it all. “How does he plan to pay for it? The way all these Democrats plan to pay for their radical proposals, taxation.  Bernie claims a wealth tax on the top 1/10 of 1 percent of Americans will fund his initiative.” She continued, “Well, folks, he and others in his party already plan to dump the burden of Medicare-for-all, free college, medical debt cancellation, and the Green New Deal on the backs of the wealthy. Do they really think the top 1 percent can afford to fund the entire nation? Total income confiscation wouldn’t pay for all those programs!” Lahren argued that increasing taxes on the wealthy encourages them to move, leaving the middle class to foot the bill. “Here’s the thing about wealth, Bernie, it’s MOBILE. Meaning the wealthiest Americans are not going to sit idly by as their incomes are confiscated to fund your big government pie-in-the-sky plans,” Lahren said. She continued, “Then what? What happens when the richest Americans take their money elsewhere? Who pays for these quasi-socialist plans? Answer, we do. The middle class, the average American.” The concern that the wealthy may move to avoid paying taxes is not a hypothetical, according to Lahren. She said that is exactly what has happened in her state. “That’s why the middle class has been driven out of places like California, for cryin’ out loud. It’s only affordable for the exorbitantly wealthy and the homeless!” LAHREN ON AMERICAN UNITY AFTER 9/11: 'WE HAVE JUST LOST IT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY' Finally, Lahren said that Sanders’ proposal would not decrease homelessness. “I live in California, the state that is comprised of 47 percent of all unsheltered people in the nation. Yet what do we do here in California? We add more taxes, more regulations, more control on top of already cash-strapped residents and families. Here’s what else I know, throwing more government and more taxpayer dollars at the problem does not solve the problem. If it did we wouldn’t be in this predicament right here in California.” Lahren concluded, “When will these socialist wannabes figure it out?  Throwing taxpayer dollars, big government and entitlement at the problem does not solve the problem. It just moves our nation one dangerous step closer to socialism. Maybe that’s what people like Bernie want but it’s up to us to stand in his way.” To see Lahren's full remarks and for more episodes of Tomi Lahren's daily commentary offering a refreshing and unfiltered perspective on issues across the country, join  Fox Nation  and watch  ""First & Final Thoughts""   today.

"Democratic lawmakers and the White House are at odds over a whistleblower complaint of an alleged promise by President Trump to a foreign leader; chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge reports from Washington. As  President Trump  faces media scrutiny over a phone call he held with  Ukraine  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Rep.  Adam Schiff , D-Calif., said he may seek to withhold funds from the  intelligence community  unless they disclose the full contents of the conversation. Schiff, who serves as the House Intel Committee chairman, appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, where host Jake Tapper asked if Schiff would be willing to put the nation at risk to get to the bottom of the cryptic report. ""It depends on what funds we withhold,"" Schiff replied. ""In this case, you have the office of the director of national intelligence that is withholding this complaint in violation of the clear letter of the law... And there are funding requests that that office makes that don’t go directly to national security that we can withhold."" The story was  first reported  by the Washington Post as a whistleblower claim about Trump making some type of ""promise"" to a foreign leader, which may have been of a nefarious nature.  Further reporting  claimed the conversation was linked to Ukraine, and Trump's request for their government to look into  2020 presidential  hopeful  Joe Biden 's son and his business dealings. GREGG JARRETT: THE TRUMP WHISTLEBLOWER MAY NOT BE A WHISTLEBLOWER AT ALL ""Look, it is a blunt remedy and one that I’m very reluctant to use,"" Schiff continued. ""At the same time, the inspector general has said this is not only serious...but it's urgent. We cannot afford to play rope-a-dope in the court for weeks or months on end. We need an answer."" Schiff also reignited the impeachment debate which seemed to be fading away, after several failed attempts by House lawmakers to oust the president from office. ""If there is a fire burning, it needs to be put out. And that's why we’re going to have to look at every remedy. And if these two issues are, in fact, one issue and it relates to deplorable conduct, a violation of the president’s oath of office... then we're going to have to consider impeachment as well,"" he said. Trump responded to the story on Twitter Thursday and again on Saturday, saying the narrative was ""fake news"" conjured up by biased members of the media. TRUMP: CONVERSATION WITH UKRANIAN PRESIDENT 'WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT,' TOUCHED ON CORRUPTION, OTHER ISSUES CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone 'bust' on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden. Will fail again!"" he wrote on Saturday. Trump also responded to the story while speaking to reporters outside the  White House  Sunday morning, and claimed he did nothing wrong. “I said absolutely nothing wrong; it was perfect,” Trump said. “There was no quid pro quo, there was nothing,” he later added."

THE SHADOW OF CORRUPTION How corrupt do you think your government is? 
According to Transparency International, which has been ranking countries on its 1-100 scale for 25 years, the United States is not very corrupt at all. 
The  most recent rankings , built through a survey of experts and businesspeople, ranks the U.S. as 22nd cleanest in the 180 nations of the world. We run in a pack with other mostly Western liberal democracies like Australia, Britain and France just behind the squeaky clean Scandinavian nations and, of course, Canada. 
We are far removed from the rampant corruption under which most of the rest of the world is forced to live. Russia, China, India and Brazil are all bad news when it comes to basic principles of fairness. All of Africa except for Botswana and every Asian nation except Japan are considered substantially corrupt.   
So your government, on an empirical basis, is pretty much on the level. 
But that’s not the important question. What matters is how corrupt do you  think  your government is. And on that score, the news is bad. 
In our most recent Fox News  poll , we asked respondents “How many people in the government do you think are corrupt -- almost all, many, some, or almost none?” The results should be sobering for everyone concerned about the current trajectory of politics. 
About one in five said that almost all of the people in government are corrupt. An amazing 43 percent said that “many” are crooked. Just 31 percent got closer to reality saying that “some” in the government are corrupt. A sad 2 percent said “almost none.” 
As with all reputational goods, like a nation’s currency, the perception of value is far more important than the actual value itself. If a government is perceived as corrupt it’s almost as bad as the real thing, and will eventually result in real corruption anyway. 
If you think the game is rigged, you’re far more likely to be willing to cheat yourself. 
The 64 percent of Americans who believe their government is rotten with corruption don’t belong to any particular demographic or political group, either. Women are a little more distrustful than men and white people are more dubious than other ethnic groups, whites without college degrees most of all. 
But religious faith, political proclivities, education and income all had relatively little bearing on the overall perception that corruption is a major problem in our government. 
It’s no wonder, given what both political parties are selling these days. It would be one thing if the response was really about “draining the swamp” and some sustained effort for reforms that might bring public perception back into alignment with reality. But what tends to happen is that politicians exploit such perceptions to create lower expectations for good government and accountability once they are in power. 
If the whole system is rigged, why should our side have to play by the rules? After all  they’re  the real crooks  
That’s how the false perception of rampant corruption makes way for the real thing. THE RULEBOOK: THERE’S A DIFFERENCE 
“It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.” –  James Madison ,  Federalist No. 14 TIME OUT: SOUNDS LIKE AMERICA Gun&Garden:  “When  Ken Burns  decides to cover a topic, set aside some time to dig in. Best known for his epics, including his  Civil War  documentary, which aired on PBS over five nights in 1990 to an audience of 40 million people, the filmmaker is now readying for the premiere his latest deep-dive,  Country Music . The eight-part, sixteen-hour film takes a magnifying glass to the forces that shaped this distinctly American sound. ‘I’m looking for stories, and I’m looking for stories that are firing on all cylinders,’ Burns tells  Garden & Gun . … The film runs chronologically, tracing the many influences that shaped country music, from enslaved people bringing the banjo across the Atlantic from Africa all the way to the heyday of pop-country in the mid-1990s. The genre, Burns reveals, is less a set of rules and boundaries than it is a spectrum—one that trades on universal truths and bridges cultural, racial, and economic divides.” Flag on the play? -  Email us at  HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM  with your tips, comments or questions.

BIDEN RACKS UP KEY ENDORSEMENTS AP:  “ Joe Biden  sought to demonstrate a broad appeal to Democrats on Thursday with new endorsements from leading African American lawmakers and a former governor of a pivotal swing state. The backing from Reps.  G.K. Butterfield  of North Carolina,  Emanuel Cleaver  of Missouri and  Charlie Crist  of Florida reflects Biden’s play both for the party establishment and for minority voters who are critical in the early stages of the primary. Butterfield and Cleaver are former chairmen of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Crist was the governor of Florida before he entered Congress. The moves are the latest example of Biden’s durability as an early Democratic front-runner. So far, he’s successfully threaded different wings of the party despite skepticism from progressives and questions about whether, at 76, he’s too old for the presidency. … [T]he support of Butterfield and Cleaver in particular is a potential blow to Sen.  Kamala Harris  [and] Sen.  Cory Booker …” Younger black voters try to pry their parents from Biden -  NYT:  “If Mr. Biden, 76, is going to win the Democratic nomination, it is likely to be because of the support of older black voters… But if he is to be overtaken by one of his more progressive rivals, the most powerful tool against him may not be opposition research or negative advertisements. Instead, it may be an organic effort by younger black voters — concerned about Mr. Biden’s age and more moderate ideology — to sway their older family members. Mr. Biden seems aware of this dynamic. In interviews, he has both acknowledged the generational gap among his black supporters and downplayed its importance, arguing that the support of older, more moderate black voters would be enough to give him an electoral advantage. Still, Mr. Biden, by his own admission, would be unwise to underestimate the lobbying efforts of those who are young and politically engaged.” Harris takes aim at Warren -  WSJ:  “Ka­mala Har­ris, now a dis­tant fourth in the De­mo­c­ra­tic pres­i­den­tial race, took aim at poll-climber  Eliz­a­beth War­ren  for do­ing big-money events. In re­sponse to a ques­tion about War­ren, Har­ris said at a closed-door fundraiser it was hyp­o­crit­i­cal for her ri­val to claim she wasn’t tak­ing money from large donors when War­ren trans­ferred around $10 mil­lion from her Sen­ate funds be­fore de­nounc­ing big money do­na­tions. Har­ris moved $1.2 mil­lion into her pres­i­den­tial fund. Har­ris lamented that she now needs to be in places like New York to keep the cam­paign fi­nan­cially afloat but prefers to spend time in early vot­ing states. On a later press call, Har­ris’s cam­paign didn’t name War­ren di­rectly but noted re­peat­edly that Har­ris came into the cam­paign with less than other can­di­dates be­cause ‘we spent 2018 rais­ing for other can­di­dates.’” And same with Buttigieg -   AP:  “Democratic presidential candidate  Pete Buttigieg  is accusing his 2020 rival Elizabeth Warren of being ‘extremely evasive’ when it comes to explaining how she'd finance a universal health care plan. Speaking on CNN on Thursday, Buttigieg issued his most pointed attack yet on the Massachusetts senator, saying she ‘was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we've seen that repeatedly.’ The sharpened critique comes as the fall campaign kicks into high gear with Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses scheduled in February. Warren has assembled a well-organized campaign there and leads Buttigieg in Iowa, where the South Bend, Indiana, mayor's longshot presidential campaign is competing heavily and trying to break through.” Yang plays Perot for a new generation -   Atlantic:  “To understand why [ Andrew Yang  is hanging on in the polls], it’s worth looking at how he responded earlier this month when  Shane Gillis , a comedian for Saturday Night Live, referred to him using a racial slur. Yang urged that Gillis not be fired. … But more revealing was Yang’s explanation for why Gillis deserved forgiveness. Gillis, Yang tweeted, ‘does not strike me as malignant or evil. He strikes me as a still-forming comedian from central Pennsylvania.’ What does central Pennsylvania have to do with it? For Andrew Yang and his supporters, everything. It’s code for economic distress—which Yang believes fuels racism and most of the other problems that menace America. … Over the past quarter century, two presidential candidates have mobilized these economics-first, culture-war-indifferent voters into a potent force. The first was  Ross Perot . The second is Andrew Yang.” De Blasiout -   Fox News:  “New York Mayor  Bill de Blasio  announced Friday he is dropping out of the 2020 Democratic primary, ending his campaign after struggling to gain traction in the race. ‘I feel like I contributed all I can to this primary election and it’s clearly not my time,’ he said during an appearance on MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe.’ ‘So I’m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City and I’m going to keep speaking up for working people.’ De Blasio entered the presidential race in May, running as a proud progressive. But his campaign never caught fire: He qualified for the first two rounds of Democratic presidential debates but has failed to make the cut for the others.” Booker hides from past alliance with DeVos -   WaPo:  “Cory Booker was a little-known member of the Newark City Council 19 years ago when he received an extraordinary invitation from a Michigan group connected to  Betsy DeVos , now the U.S. Secretary of Education. DeVos and her husband,  Dick , were leading Republican proponents of a state ballot initiative that would allow taxpayer-financed vouchers to pay for private schools. … Booker accepted. … But as Booker runs for president, his relationship with DeVos, his previous support of vouchers and his continuing praise for charter schools present potential roadblocks. Vouchers and charters schools are anathema to many powerful teachers unions, who have outsize power in Democratic primaries, and some candidates in the party strongly oppose them on the grounds that they weaken traditional public schools.” UKRAINE AT CENTER OF FIGHT OVER ALLEGED TRUMP PROMISE Fox News:  “The developing controversy over a mysterious phone conversation  President Trump  had with a foreign leader apparently centers on Ukraine, as the president and his allies fight back and claim the uproar is just another ‘partisan’ plot against him. What touched off the controversy is a secret whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ‘promise’ Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. Trump's attorney,  Rudy Giuliani , seemed to acknowledge some effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate potential corruption related to the Biden family, though he gave conflicting answers on the matter in a CNN interview overnight. It remains unclear what the supposed ‘promise’ from Trump entailed. The president, however, maintained he said nothing improper, tearing into those pushing the allegations Friday.” Giuliani inconsistent -  WaPo:  “Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, contradicted himself when asked whether he personally asked Ukraine to investigate former vice president  Joe Biden , ranted about media bias and defended Trump amid new reports about an intelligence official’s whistleblower complaint, during a chaotic and fiery CNN interview Thursday night. Immediately after anchor  Chris Cuomo  introduced him and summarized the latest news out of the whistleblower story, which had only broken about an hour prior, Giuliani went into attack mode. … Giuliani spent the first half of the interview repeating the claim that Biden in 2016 pressured Ukraine to drop its top prosecutor, which at the time was also investigating a natural gas company where Biden’s son  Hunter  was on the board. …There’s been no evidence found that Biden was trying to help out his son.” TRUMP RALLIES WITH MODI IN OUTREACH TO KEY VOTER BLOC WaPo:  “President Trump heads to Harris County, Texas this weekend to a major rally ahead of next week's United Nations General Assembly — for Indian Prime Minister  Narendra Modi . The website for the ‘Howdy, Modi’ rally boasts that the ‘live audience will be the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader visiting the United States other than the Pope’: Some 50,000 people, many from Houston's large Indian diaspora, are expected to turn out. It's eye-popping that leaders of the world's two biggest democracies are appearing together at such an event — let alone that this particular American president will be holding court in the epicenter of Texas's blue wave and the most diverse city in America. You're not wrong if you think that doesn't sound like friendly territory for Trump. But that's a strong political reason for him to go: Democrats are making a big play for Texas in 2020 and Republicans are growing concerned. The rally for Modi, who is hugely popular in India, provides Trump with access to a potential pool of Indian American voters that could turn out to be critical in next year's presidential elections.” SENATE DEMS NEED BIG WINS IN THE SUN BELT Politico:  “To take back the White House, Democrats only need to win back three key Rust Belt states. But if they want to move a president’s agenda through the Senate, they have to flip the Sun Belt. From Arizona to North Carolina to a pair of seats in Georgia, Democrats have to clean up in that stretch of the country to have any chance of taking the chamber. President Donald Trump carried each of those states in 2016, and in an era of polarized politics when Senate races are increasingly nationalized, Democrats need at least strong performances by the party's presidential nominee in the Sun Belt states — if not victories — to have a shot at flipping their Senate seats. So while some Democrats are laser-focused on winning back the Rust Belt, Democrats across the Southern half of the country are urging their party to invest heavily in their states — not just as a way to flip the Senate, but as part of the path to 270 Electoral College votes.” Kemp frustrates GOP with cattle call for Senate appointment -   AJC:  “Within hours of Gov.  Brian Kemp ’s unusual decision to invite the public to apply to succeed U.S. Sen.  Johnny Isakson , his office was blitzed with resumes — some serious and some silly — from wannabe Washingtonians.Lawyers. Doctors. Local government officials. Serial jokesters. IT specialists. A well-known pundit. As of Wednesday evening, 158 people had applied — and many, many more are expected to join in. … Welcome to the next phase of the race for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Chances are, Kemp and his advisers already have whittled a list of top contenders for Isakson’s seat down to a handful — and that the online application process unveiled late Tuesday will be largely for show. But encouraging would-be U.S. senators to publicly declare their ambition might just expand the scope of his search even as it forces some tough decisions on potential contenders.” PLAY-BY-PLAY Fox Poll: Voters are frustrated with government, nervous about economy   -  Fox News Trump files lawsuit in bid to protect personal, corporate tax returns from release  -  Fox News McConnell flips stance, announces support for $250 million in election security funding  -  WaPo Sanders becomes first Dem candidate to hit one million donors  -  Politico AUDIBLE: IOWA NICE?

"Top conservative blogger Matt Drudge says the Democratic presidential nomination is Elizabeth Warren's to lose; reaction on 'The Five.' A Wall Street executive made a gloomy prediction on Thursday about a potential  Elizabeth Warren  presidency, suggesting that the stock market ""won't open"" if she was sworn into office. Omega Advisors CEO Leon Cooperman appeared on CNBC to express his concerns and shared his predictions on what would happen if the Massachusetts senator was elected. ""There’s unquestionably a shift to the left in this country. They won’t open the stock market if Elizabeth Warren is the next president,"" Cooperman claimed. He later explained his rationale; “When I said they wouldn’t open the market if Elizabeth Warren won, my way of just saying the market would be very vulnerable.” WARREN GETS STUMPED BY COLBERT WHEN PRESSED ON MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES TO FUND MEDICARE-FOR-ALL When asked what will happen to the stock market if Warren clinches the Democratic nomination, Cooperman predicted that the market will be ""lower"" if she or her progressive colleague, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, becomes a ""credible opponent"" to President Trump, citing a potential ""25 percent"" dip in the market. ""Her policies are counterproductive, they're negative for capitalism, and the capitalism is what brought America to the position that we're in today,"" Cooperman added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Democratic 2020 hopeful offered a response to Cooperman on Twitter. ""Our economy works great for people who can use their money and power to become even richer and more powerful,"" Warren wrote. ""But I've got a plan to ensure it works for everyone else too. If that scares hedge fund billionaires like this guy, fine by me."""
"The Deep State tried to use an illegitimate tool to throw up a smokescreen to distract the American people from President Trump's success, says former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. The Democratic media  narrative  of impeachment portrays President Trump and his administration as serial law-breakers who, true to form, obstruct all congressional investigations of wrongdoing. This then becomes the analytical framework for every new controversy. There are at least two fundamental problems with this. First, our constitutional system is based on friction between competing  branches  vested with separate but closely related powers. The framers understood that the two political branches would periodically try to usurp each other’s authorities. Congress often does this by enactments that seek to subject executive power to congressional (or judicial) supervision. Presidential pushback on such laws is not criminal obstruction; it is the Constitution in action. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Second, we’ve become so law-obsessed that we miss the forest for the trees. Often, the least important aspect of a controversy — viz., whether a law has been violated — becomes the dominant  consideration . Short shrift is given to the more consequential aspects, such as whether we are being competently governed or whether power is being abused. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP These problems are now playing out in the Trump controversy du jour (or should I say de l’heure?): the intelligence community whistleblower.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump pressed the Ukrainian president in a July call to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son, according to a person familiar with the conversation, an apparently blatant mixture of foreign policy with his 2020 re-election campaign. Mr. Trump also repeatedly told the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, to talk with his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had been urging the government in Kiev to investigate Mr. Biden and his family, according to two other people briefed on the call. Mr. Trump’s request is part of the secret whistle-blower complaint that is said to be about Mr. Trump and at least in part about  his dealings with Ukraine , according to two people familiar with the complaint. Mr. Biden is a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. The president has made no secret that he wanted Ukraine to investigate any improper overlap between Mr. Biden’s own diplomatic efforts there and his son’s role with a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. “Someone ought to look into Joe Biden,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday in response to a question about his call with Mr. Zelensky. The revelations added urgency to questions about Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, which is battling Russian-controlled separatists in the country’s east. When the president sought the Biden investigation, the Trump administration’s military aid to Ukraine had been frozen for weeks. The United States suspended that assistance in early July, according to a former American official. Mr. Trump did not discuss the aid in the July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky, whose government did not learn of the suspension until August, according to people familiar with the call. The Wall Street Journal  first reported  details of the call. For Democrats who want to examine the whistle-blower complaint — itself the subject of  an internal administration dispute  over whether to hand it over to Congress, as is generally required by law — the key question is whether Mr. Trump was demanding a quid pro quo, explicitly or implicitly. Democratic House committee chairmen  are already investigating  whether he manipulated American foreign policy for personal political advantage and have requested the transcript of the Zelensky call. The growing controversy had echoes of the dominant scandal of the first years of Mr. Trump’s administration: whether his campaign sought help from Russia to benefit him in 2016. Ultimately,  the special counsel found  that although “insufficient evidence” existed to determine that Mr. Trump or his advisers engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the Russians, his campaign welcomed Moscow’s election sabotage and expected to benefit from it. Any attempt by Mr. Trump to ask a foreign power to “dig up dirt” on a political rival while withholding aid is corrupt, said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, one of the panels examining Mr. Trump’s Ukraine dealings. “No explicit quid pro quo is necessary to betray your country,”  tweeted Mr. Schiff , who has also pushed for the whistle-blower complaint to be given to Congress. Mr. Trump opened a direct counterattack on Friday against the whistle-blower, whose identity is unknown, as are many details about the complaint. The president dismissed the allegations and labeled the whistle-blower, without evidence, a political partisan. “It’s a ridiculous story. It’s a partisan whistle-blower,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, though he acknowledged he did not know the person’s identity. “They shouldn’t even have information.” Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have pressed for an investigation of the Bidens for weeks, after reports this year in  The New York Times  and  elsewhere  examined whether a Ukrainian energy company sought to buy influence in Washington by hiring Mr. Biden’s younger son, Hunter Biden. The younger Biden had a lobbying business in Ukraine while his father was vice president. When he was vice president, Mr. Biden cast himself as both the Obama administration’s advocate of military assistance to Kiev as well as the chief antagonist of the notorious corruption in Ukraine’s government. In early 2016, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in American loan guarantees if Ukraine’s top prosecutor was not dismissed after accusations that he had ignored rampant corruption. Mr. Biden succeeded; the prosecutor general was voted out office. And Hunter Biden had an interest in the outcome: He sat on the board of an energy company that had been in the sights of the ousted prosecutor general. On Friday, the former vice president accused Mr. Trump in a statement of using the power of the United States to extract “a political favor.” Mr. Biden called for the president to release the transcript of his call with Mr. Zelensky and said that if the reports about it proved true, “there was no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.” He also said the allegations that he or his son committed wrongdoing in Ukraine were baseless. “Not one single outlet has given any credibility to his assertion,” Mr. Biden told reporters after a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Controversy over the Trump administration’s Ukraine policy has swirled for weeks but has been confined mostly to foreign policy experts. The revelations about the whistle-blower complaint plunged the issue into the center of the political debate. Congress has still not seen the whistle-blower’s allegation. Although the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, has sought to provide it, the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has blocked him in  a dispute over legal requirements . Mr. Maguire and his general counsel decided against providing the complaint to Congress after consulting with Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, according to a person familiar with the move. Mounting evidence that the White House was involved in the effort to withhold the complaint from lawmakers has stirred anger on Capitol Hill. Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Mr. Maguire of violating the law. “If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,” she added in a statement. Republicans were largely silent about Mr. Trump’s calls for a foreign investigation of his political rival. Their apparent desire to avoid criticizing the president during a political crisis stood in contrast to the criticism from party members after the administration froze aid to Ukraine. The administration, critics said, has struggled to explain the move, which has convinced some Democrats that it was part of an effort bring about a Biden investigation. “They have no shame,” said Michael Carpenter, a former aide to Mr. Biden and expert on Ukraine. He added: “They released the assistance in mid-September after the bipartisan uproar over the freeze — and under pressure from the House investigations. But strikingly, the administration never articulated why the assistance was frozen in the first place.” Mr. Giuliani has spearheaded a push for a Biden inquiry. He  met with Mr. Zelensky’s emissaries  this summer in hopes of encouraging his government to pursue investigations into the family as well as whether Ukrainian officials took steps during the 2016 election to damage Mr. Trump’s campaign. Mr. Giuliani has said he was acting on his own, though his comments on Thursday seemed to draw a closer connection to Mr. Trump. “A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job,”  Mr. Giuliani tweeted  shortly after  an appearance on CNN,  where he first denied, then admitted, asking the government in Kiev to investigate the Bidens. Although they agreed to meet with Mr. Giuliani, the Ukrainians have so far refused to open the investigations. But there is little doubt the pressure from Mr. Trump is causing stress on the new government, according to a former Ukrainian official. Since 2014, Ukraine has been under attack by Russia and its proxy, a fight that has become a grinding conflict that has made it difficult for Kiev to continue its overhaul efforts and work to become more integrated with Europe and the West. But now Ukraine also finds itself potentially at odds with the leader of its most critical partner, the United States, and at the center of a political battle in Washington. Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky  will meet next week  on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, a senior administration official confirmed on Friday after Mr. Zelensky’s office announced the meeting. But the administration has put off any commitment for a White House meeting, which Mr. Zelensky views as critical for the relationship."

"But in a back-and-forth with reporters, he did not deny discussing former Vice President Joe Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call -- a potential subject for the complaint.  And he admitted he did not know the whistleblower's identity, despite his accusation of partisanship. It was a robust self-defense against accusations that remain, for now, veiled in mystery. An intelligence watchdog has said the claims are ""urgent"" and ""serious,"" but the acting top intelligence official has declined to provide them to Congress. Trump dismissed them as another attempt to bring down his presidency. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump called the story ""ridiculous"" and described the whistleblower as ""just another political hack job.""  ""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" Trump said alongside his Australian counterpart, who he was hosting for a state visit. Asked whether he'd discussed Biden with Ukraine's Zelensky during a phone call in late July, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed,"" but insisted that someone should look into Biden. ""It was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor's taken off the case,"" Trump said, appearing to refer to January remarks when Biden discussed his interactions with Ukraine's leadership when serving as vice president. ""The fake news,"" Trump claimed,""doesn't look into things like that."" Trump's remarks came a day after the New York Times and Washington Post reported that an intelligence whistleblower had submitted a complaint related to Trump's interactions on Ukraine. Precise details of the accusation aren't known, much to the chagrin of Democratic lawmakers, who have demanded more information. Trump admitted Friday he did not know the whistleblower's identity, and said he wasn't even sure if it was his conversation with Ukraine's leader that was the topic of the complaint. But he nevertheless appeared defensive about his interactions with Zelensky, whom he will meet next week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Appearing in a rambling interview on CNN on Thursday evening, the President's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani admitted he himself had discussed Biden with Ukraine's leaders during a visit to the country. That conversation has come under scrutiny from House investigators, who have demanded more information about Trump and Giuliani's interactions regarding Ukraine and the Biden matter. That includes a transcript of Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president. Democrats are also looking for more information about the whistleblower's complaint. ""There's a real sense of urgency here since the Inspector General was so clear this is not something that can wait,"" said House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff on Friday, a day after his panel was briefed behind closed doors by the inspector general."
"5. The race to make the next debate:  The October 1 deadline to qualify for the fourth Democratic debate -- set for October 15 and sponsored by CNN and The New York Times -- is rapidly approaching, and with it the last chance, seemingly, for any lower-tier candidates to make the case that they shouldn't be counted out just yet. (Missing one debate is bad enough. Missing two is a political death sentence.) At the moment, the field is at 11, with wealthy businessman Tom Steyer making the October debate after narrowly missing the September set-to. The only other candidate who appears to be on the cusp of qualification is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who, with the  CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll  released over the weekend, now has three of the four polls that she needs showing her at 2% or higher. (Gabbard has already met the fundraising threshold with 130,000 unique donors.) Spiritual guru Marianne Williamson has met the fundraising qualification but has only a single poll that shows her at 2%. (She didn't even rate 1% in  the CNN-DMR poll .) The largest the debate field will grow then, realistically, is 12. Which means that eight candidates currently running won't be on the debate stage for the second straight month. Which should tell them all something. 4. Can Kamala come back?:  Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,""  said her campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez. So, will it work? Harris has her work cut out for her, according to the  new CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll.  She's at 6%, good for 5th place, at the moment but that is largely stagnant from where she's been in the state since December 2018. (She was at 5% then.) Harris is generally well-liked in the state -- 63% favorable/24% unfavorable -- but her unfavorables have tripled since March and her favorables have only bumped up marginally (58% in March). And those who feel strongly favorable toward Harris (26%) -- usually a good measure of energy behind a candidate -- runs behind her main rivals like Elizabeth Warren (44%), Pete Buttigieg (33%), Joe Biden (29%) and Bernie Sanders (26%). Harris does have time, as there are  still  134 days before the February 3, 2020 caucuses. But she has been stuck in the same place in Iowa for months. Which means she needs a jump-start. And soon. 3. Booker over and out?:  Cory Booker may be the next high-profile candidate out of the 2020 race, according to a memo from his campaign manager first reported by NBC. The memo suggested that unless the New Jersey senator can raise $1.7 million in the next 10 days, he will run out of money and be forced from the race. The campaign insisted the move was not a fundraising ploy, but it worked either way! As of Sunday morning, Booker had raised just over $300,000 in the first 24 hours of the fundraising push. Of course, $300K -- while good! -- is not $1.7 million. And you can't just keep warning that you are going to drop out of the race unless people give you more money for the remainder of the contest. The sky can only be falling once (or maybe twice!) ""I don't believe people should stay in this just to stay in it,"" Booker said in Iowa on Saturday. ""You either have a trajectory to win or not. And right now, we don't raise $1.7 million, we won't be able to make the investments necessary."" Booker may get his $1.7 million this time. But without significant poll improvements, it's hard to see how he can keep raising the money he is going to need to compete with the big girls and boys. He will, for sure, stay in the race until the next debate -- October 15 in Ohio and sponsored by CNN. But is there a path beyond that? 2. Elizabeth Warren, Iowa front-runner:  Warren has been the hottest candidate in the 2020 race for the past few months now. And it's showing up not just in national polling but now also in the crucial state of Iowa. The  Des Moines Register/CNN/MediaCom Iowa poll  released Saturday night showed Warren at 22% and at the top of the pack although followed closely by Joe Biden at 20%. No one else in the field was terribly close to the top two, with Bernie Sanders at 11% in third place and Pete Buttigieg in fourth with 9%. While the topline numbers are good for Warren, the trend lines are even better. She gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now. Warren's favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is beyond her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders. Couple all of those data points with the fact that Warren has, by far, the best ground organization in Iowa, and you have to make her the favorite in the Hawkeye State today. 1. Trump vs. Biden vs. Ukraine:  It's only September, but we're already getting a look at what a general election fight between Trump and Biden would look like. Faced with a whistleblower complaint from the intelligence community about a series of interactions between himself and the Ukrainians, Trump is trying to push the attention to Biden and his son, Hunter, vis a vis Ukraine. Fact checkers have  already debunked Trump's claims  about there being something nefarious in Biden's trip to the Ukraine in 2016 and his son's work for a natural gas company in the country, and there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either. Biden has pushed back aggressively. ""Every single outlet that's looked at this said there's nothing there there,""  he told the Iowa Starting Line . ""And me, nor anyone in my family did anything inappropriate. And every major outlet has acknowledged that. I just find it very Trump-like."" It is very ""Trump-like!"" Because, facts be damned, Trump has and will continue to use his media megaphone -- press gaggles + Twitter -- to push the idea that something was going on in Ukraine with the two Bidens. And if past is prologue, he won't stop -- no matter what fact-checkers or his advisers tell him. On the one hand, this fight is good for Biden. Electability is his strongest argument to Democratic voters -- and the more Trump hits Biden, the more the former vice president can seek to bypass the primary and begin running the general election. On the other, it's reminder that whether Biden or some other Democrat is the nominee, we can expect Trump to say and do literally anything in pursuit of a second term."

"President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani on his conversation with Ukraine officials. President Trump ’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani aimed to clarify what he said in a recent  CNN  interview about his involvement with Ukraine investigating Joe Biden's son Hunter, after the network’s Chris Cuomo accused him of contradicting himself. Giuliani first said no when Cuomo asked if he urged Ukraine to investigate Biden, saying instead that he asked the country to investigate allegations of election interference by Ukraine for the benefit of Hillary Clinton. He later said he did ask Ukraine to investigate a newly appointed prosecutor. Cuomo replied, “So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?” and Giuliani responded, “Of course I did.” When Cuomo called out the apparent contradiction, Giuliani followed up, “No. I didn't ask them to look into Joe Biden. I asked them to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme.” TRUMP: CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ‘WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT,’ TOUCHED ON CORRUPTION, OTHER ISSUES “The no was obviously wrong, I corrected it immediately,” Giuliani said  on “Fox News Sunday,”  adding, “I corrected it before he corrected it. The reality is, the distinction is this: What they’re saying is, I went there for, on a political mission, to kind of get Joe Biden in trouble. Ridiculous. I went there as a lawyer defending his client.” Hunter Biden had been the subject of an investigation by Ukrainian authorities based on his business dealings with energy company Burisma. Giuliani said the case was dropped only after then-Vice President Biden got the prosecutor fired and then had influence over the selection of his replacement. “You don’t get to approve a prosecutor in a foreign country unless something fishy’s going on,” Giuliani said. He explained that his original purpose in going to Ukraine was to look into election interference, not the Bidens, but the two matters were “inextricably combined,” so one led to the other. “This is going to get bigger and bigger, and everything I say I can prove.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden has denied any wrongdoing, although he publicly said in the past that he threatened to withhold $1 billion from Ukraine if they did not fire the prosecutor. That prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, already had been facing allegations of corruption. It was reported last week that during a July phone call, Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to work with Giuliani in investigating the Bidens. Trump  fought back  Sunday, telling reporters he “said absolutely nothing wrong.” Fox News' John Roberts contributed to this report."
"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — College students are back on campus.  Bernie Sanders  is, too. Earlier this month at Iowa State University, he lectured to young voters as they played “Green New Deal Pong” (the  Solo cups  were filled with green-colored water) and “Bern Bag Toss.”  At the University of Nevada, Reno,  he croaked through a hoarse voice to address a crowd that stretched from the college lawn to the open-air floors of a  parking garage beside it. And at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Thursday evening, he implored students to get themselves to the primary polls come February — and vote for him. “You have friends out there, and I know you do, who think that the political system” is absurd, he said, using a colorful expletive. “Tell them that instead of just complaining, they must get involved into the political process.” It was a sentiment he has repeated often this month as he crisscrossed the country on what has amounted to a whirlwind back-to-school tour. In Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina, he has by turns used flattery (“Your generation is the most progressive younger generation in the history of this country”) and subtle warnings (“The future of this country and in fact the world rests with your generation”) to bolster his appeals. Everywhere, his goal was the same: muster a version of the army of young voters who propelled his campaign in 2016. His message was one that has resonated with Brianna Williams, 19, who arrived with a group of friends to hear him in Chapel Hill .  “I’ve seen a lot of his policies, and I’m just excited for what he has to offer as a candidate,” she said. But she was just as excited by Senator Elizabeth Warren. “I would love to see a woman running the country,” she said. “That would be really cool.” Last time around, Mr. Sanders’s rants against the elite and promises of free college tuition endeared him to legions of young fans. It also helped that Mr. Sanders —  74  at the time, with unruly white hair and an old-school Brooklyn accent — was both decidedly uncool and new to presidential politics, affording his campaign a paradoxical edge that inspired millions of young supporters to “feel the bern” and vote for him over Hillary Clinton.  As he fights anew for the Democratic nomination, it is not lost on him or his allies that his success hinges, in no small part, on his ability to capture that enthusiasm again —  for both the optics of his race and the actual votes.   But this time he is no longer an insurgent, nor is he the only anti-establishment candidate in the race — factors that helped boost his standing among young voters. With the race entering the crucial fall period, other candidates, including Ms. Warren and Andrew Yang, have begun siphoning off some of his support. [ Sign up for our politics newsletter  hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race. ] Even Mr. Sanders’s closest advisers acknowledge that he cannot take for granted a voting cohort they view as critical, even if it is traditionally unreliable in actually making it to the ballot box. “Last time it was much more organic,” Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, said. “And this time it’s far more intentional.” In interviews, many young voters still praised Mr. Sanders, sometimes breathlessly — citing his authenticity and conviction but also his calls for free college and universal health care and his proposal to cancel student debt. But many also expressed curiosity, if not exuberance, about other candidates  “I love everything he stands for,” said Asha Loutsch, 18, as she sat with a circle of friends who were waiting for his event at the University of Iowa. “I think he really cares about what he’s trying to say. Like, he’s always getting up in there, you know?” But she also said she was interested in Ms. Warren and wanted to hear her speak. Jiego Lim, an 18-year-old student at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was volunteering at Mr. Sanders’s event there, said he supported Mr. Sanders but was also intrigued by Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris. “I feel like we need a fresh new face in politics,” he said. “Bernie comes off aggressive to me sometimes.” Others were less equivocal.  “He’s America’s dad,” offered Gabriel Olier, 19, a student in Reno. “I love Bernie.” That affection for Mr. Sanders is reflected in some more tangible metrics. His campaign said it had so far raised over $1 million from people under the age of 25, a relatively small figure compared to his overall haul but one that nevertheless points to his continued strength with young voters. [ Here’s the latest data  on who’s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] And in most polls, Mr. Sanders still maintains a strong lead among young voters:  A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey  showed that a third of voters under 35 supported him. Yet at the same time, a quarter of these respondents said they supported Ms. Warren , suggesting Mr. Sanders no longer has the same hold on the group he had in 2016. Any candidate relying on the support of younger voters faces an undeniable challenge: Younger voters tend not to vote in high numbers compared with other groups. In the 2016 election, for instance, only  11 percent of voters  under 30 participated in the Iowa caucuses, representing just 15 percent of the total, according to an estimate from the  Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and  Engagement   at Tufts University. But the high turnout among young voters during the 2018 midterm elections has given some experts hope that the 2020 election will be different. That strong showing has provided organizers with a larger pool to identify and target potential presidential voters. Issues, including climate change, criminal justice, health care and gun control, are also motivating young voters to act. “The truth is that if younger people in this country voted at the same level as people 65 and over, we could transform this country,” Mr. Sanders said this month at the University of Iowa. “Please do it!” John Della Volpe , the director of polling at Harvard’s  Institute of Politics , said that Mr. Sanders was still “doing really well” but that the field was more complex and his pool of support was smaller. “At this stage, he’s essentially sharing support of young people in most polls with Elizabeth Warren,” Mr. Della Volpe said. “The idea of going after structural reforms is really, I think, what is resonating so clearly with young people.” Indeed, of all the other candidates, it is Ms. Warren who appears to be generating the most powerful wave of energy among young voters in Democratic presidential politics — particularly among those who once supported Mr. Sanders. Olivia Stecklein, 19, a student at the University of Iowa, said she had been a fan of Mr. Sanders since 2015 but was now choosing between him and Ms. Warren. “I feel like they’re pretty similar, but I just kind of like how Elizabeth Warren has a set-out plan for everything,” she said. “She just seems very prepared.” Eliza Link, 18, a University of Iowa student, said she was also deciding between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. “I think they’re both the cool aunt and uncle of the political race right now,” she said. With his characteristic verve that can exhaust even young reporters, Mr. Sanders has been in an all-out sprint to earn the vote of the youths, months before any of them can even cast their vote.  His team set up a Bernie Summer School program to train campus leaders in the art of campaigning. He urged his campaign to get him back on college campuses in the first weeks of the new school year. He constantly asks his team to share data on young voters. To win over the group, however, Mr. Sanders will have to convince people like Tim Watts, 19. Before Mr. Sanders’s event in Reno, Mr. Watts wore a “MATH” hat, the universal accessory of Yang supporters. But despite his overt support for Mr. Yang — who in some ways is benefiting from the outsider status among young voters that Mr. Sanders enjoyed in 2016 — Mr. Watts said he had not yet closed the door on Mr. Sanders. “I’m part of the Yang gang, I guess,” he said. “I will probably feel the bern later.” Rachel Shorey contributed reporting from Washington."
"New revelations, and now a previously-unseen interview, raising questions over former Vice President Joe  Biden's  account of his handling of Anita  Hill's  1991 sexual harassment allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence  Thomas . Biden chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation hearing of Thomas and the committee heard testimony from Thomas and Hill.  Biden has repeatedly  claimed  that he believed Hill from the very beginning and that he did everything in his power to keep Thomas from being confirmed. 'SPECIAL INTERESTS' WANTS TO TARNISH KAVANAUGH, AS THEY DID THOMAS: CLARENCE THOMAS ADVISER However, Biden's account is challenged in the Fox Nation documentary  'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching '  and now Fox Nation is releasing previously-unseen interviews elaborating on these claims. In  'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching ',  former Senator Orrin Hatch R-Utah, who sat on the 1991 Judiciary committee with Biden, told Fox Nation that Biden told him during the hearings that he 'didn’t believe [Hill].'"" Longtime Thomas adviser and radio host, Armstrong Williams told Fox Nation that ""Biden assured [Thomas], repeatedly on the phone and in person, 'Clarence, you will be confirmed.'"" Now, in new interview material, Williams said ""Joe Biden wanted to vote for Thomas – remember.  Joe Biden is getting grief right now because [of the way] they say he treated Anita Hill...by and large, the Southern Senators and Biden liked Thomas."" Thomas' nomination was eventually confirmed by a narrow majority of 52 to 48.  Biden voted against sending Thomas to the Supreme Court. “Biden was always confidentially talking to Thomas saying ‘I’m with you. I’m with you.’  That’s something that people don’t know.  Biden was very much encouraging him, behind the scenes. Telling him to hang in there...Behind the scenes, no one could have been more gracious than Biden,"" Williams continued. WOULD IT GO VIRAL TODAY? EXPLOSIVE TESTIMONY IN THOMAS/HILL SAGA: NEW DOC Biden's handling of the hearings has long been a point of contention for his critics, who fault Biden for not allowing more witnesses, supportive of Hill, to testify. In March, Biden  lamented  his apparent inability to provide a different forum for Hill to air her allegations. ""To this day I regret I couldn't come up with a way to give her the kind of hearing she deserved,"" Biden said at a New York City event honoring young people who helped combat sexual assault on college campuses. ""I wish I could have done something."" According to Williams, Biden pro-actively prevented witnesses from making allegations that Biden deemed unfounded. ""Well, there were people that wanted to testify, who had no credibility, that the other side was pushing for -- Biden never allowed them on the docket.""

I know conservatives are not going to like it, but as far as I'm concerned Biden was always decent,"" said Williams. Williams also acknowledged that his account may not be politically-advantageous to Biden. “I had no issue with Biden during that process.  Biden did all he could – this may not help him on-camera – Biden did all he could to be fair to Judge Thomas at the time.  He could not have been more gracious and more communicative with the Justice at the time, and he apologized profusely.  He felt so bad [about] what was happening to him and these allegations.” 'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching'  is available exclusively on  Fox Nation.

"Klopfer died on September 3 and his family  was going through his belongings at his home  in Will County, about 45 miles from Chicago, when they found the medically preserved remains, authorities said. They were inside small, sealed plastic bags that contained a chemical used to preserve biological material, Will County Sheriff Mike Kelley told reporters at a news conference Thursday. They were in boxes that were mixed in with other storage boxes  ""I can tell you, the 31 years I've been doing this job, I have never seen anything like this, ever. It is a strange, one of those once-in-a-lifetime things,"" he said.  Klopfer operated three abortion clinics in South Bend, Indiana, before his license was suspended in 2015. County officials estimated how long the remains had been preserved but did not provide details on how they determined they were from nearly two decades ago. ""The condition they are in, it is clear that they are older,"" said James Glasgow, Will County state's attorney.  Klopfer did not follow Indiana law for disposal of the fetal remains and the filing of the proper paperwork, Glasgow said. The remains will be transferred to the custody of the Indiana attorney general.  An attorney representing the doctor's family called the Will County coroner's office on September 12 to inform them the family had discovered what appeared to be the remains of fetuses and asked for assistance in removing them, the Will County Sheriff's Office said. Detectives arrived at the address and the coroner's office took the remains. The family is cooperating with the investigation.  There is no evidence any medical procedures were conducted at the doctor's property, according to the sheriff's office.  Anti-abortion groups have gathered at the site of his former clinics to demand the identification and burial of the remains,  CNN affiliate WNDU reported.  One woman  told WNDU  that she was raped as a minor and had an abortion at one of Klopfer's clinics. ""For me, closure would be just know if my baby was on his property so that I can just have a proper burial,"" Serena Dyksen said.  South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, called for an investigation. ""Like everyone, I find the news out of Illinois extremely disturbing, and I think it's important that it be fully investigated,"" Buttigieg  said Wednesday . ""I also hope it doesn't get caught up in politics at a time when women need access to health care. There's no question that what happened is disturbing. It's unacceptable. And it needs to be looked into fully."""

"Despite major holes in The New York Times story, members of 'The Squad' are calling for Brett Kavanaugh's impeachment and other top Democrats are attacking the FBI's investigation into the allegations; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' The latest smear on Supreme Court Justice  Brett Kavanaugh  is a disaster for Democrats, and everyone seems to know it except the party's presidential candidates. No sooner had The New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, then most of the candidates demanded Kavanaugh's  impeachment . ""These newest revelations are disturbing,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter, adding ""Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."" RUSH LIMBAUGH: TREATMENT OF TRUMP BY DEMOCRATS, MEDIA HAS AMERICANS 'QUIETLY SEETHING' Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Kavanaugh's ""place on the court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached."" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Obama housing secretary Julián Castro and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke joined in with impeachment calls of their own. Even former Vice President Joe Biden demanded Congress open an investigation and ""follow the evidence to wherever it leads."" That was considered the restrained response in the Democratic field. Never mind that the supposed victim has told friends she has no recollection of the alleged incident; facts have never stood in the Democrats' way when it comes to Kavanaugh before. If the Democratic presidential contenders want to see  Kavanaugh  impeached, I say go for it. Open the investigation Biden has demanded. Start impeachment hearings. And broadcast it for all of America to see. Let's remind voters of the disgraceful confirmation process Kavanaugh faced. Let's relive how Democrats accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, exposing himself to a college classmate and participating in gang rapes at high school parties -- all without a shred of corroborating evidence. Let's rehash Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, but this time with the knowledge that the principal witness Ford named to her alleged assault, Leland Keyser, is now on record saying she does not believe Ford. Let's remind Americans how Senate Democrats denied Kavanaugh the presumption of innocence and insisted that the burden was on him to prove he was not a sexual predator. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER That sure worked out well for Democrats last time around. In 2018, the Kavanaugh debacle may have cost Democrats control of the Senate. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D.-Mo., lost their seats thanks to voters disgusted by their party's campaign of character assassination against Kavanaugh, while Democrats blew a chance to pick up GOP seats in Tennessee and Texas. As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at the time, the Kavanaugh hearings were ""like an adrenaline shot"" for the Republican base. Now, Democrats want to bring out the hypodermic needle for the 2020 elections. Sounds good to me. On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders know this a path to disaster. In a stunning rebuke of the party's presidential contenders, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told those calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment to ""get real."" ""We've got to get beyond this 'impeachment is the answer to every problem,'"" Durbin said. ""It's become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you're unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. ... If that's how we are identified ... we run the risk that people will feel we're ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was even more succinct. Asked if the House was going to investigate the new allegation, she said ""no."" Durbin and Pelosi understand that the threats to impeach Kavanaugh are a godsend for Trump. And they come in the wake of Senate Democrats issuing an unprecedented threat to the other Supreme Court justices. In a brief, they warned that if the high court does not rule as Democrats wish in a gun case, they could ""restructure"" the court when they take power in the 2020 elections -- packing it with liberal justices, flipping a 5-to-4 conservative majority to a liberal majority. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats do not seem to realize that when they make threats like these, they are not hurting Kavanaugh or Trump, they are hurting themselves. In 2016, 26 percent of Trump voters said Supreme Court nominees were the most important issue to them, while only 18 percent of Hillary Clinton's voters mirrored the sentiment. As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose. In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Kavanaugh or liberal court-packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should. So, let the impeachment proceedings begin. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MARC THIESSEN"
"Here's what else you need to know to  Get Up to Speed and Out the Door . (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily.  Sign up here .) 1. Whistleblower scandal OK, this story is really complicated, so let's just start at the beginning. A whistleblower inside the intelligence community filed a complaint about communications between President Trump and a foreign leader. The whistleblower was alarmed by a ""promise"" Trump allegedly made to the foreign leader. The Democratically led House Intelligence Committee wants to see the complaint, but Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence, has blocked that. (He's set to testify before the committee next week.) The White House and Justice Department told the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  not to share the complaint  because they don't believe it's governed by laws covering intelligence whistleblowers, three sources told CNN. Then, yesterday the  Washington Post  and  New York Times  reported that the communications at the center of all this involved Ukraine. Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by phone in July. Some Trump supporters have  pushed for the Ukrainian government to open investigations  that the President could use to raise suspicions about his political rivals, including Joe Biden. Some observers wonder if there's a connection between the push for an investigation and Trump's call with Zelensky. But there's no public evidence that the whistleblower's complaint pertains to the Trump-Zelensky call. The potential ramifications of this story are starting to become more clear, CNN political analyst Stephen Collinson says, and the  risks facing the President, the intelligence community and Democrats  in Congress are climbing by the day.  Here are 5 key questions  about the whistleblower case. 2. Justin Trudeau Another day, another apology from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. After a  third incident emerged  of him  wearing brownface or blackface , he was forced to meet with reporters for the second day in a row to say he's sorry for wearing racist makeup. He also flat out said he doesn't remember how many times he's worn blackface. Trudeau, known for his uber-progressive views, insists he's still an ally in the fight for social justice. But this scandal  and other recent political hiccups  could mix to seriously threaten his chances at re-election next month. 3. Israel It's been three days since votes were cast in Israel's elections, and we  still don't know who will be leading the country . Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White party, declared victory because his party is projected to win a few more seats in Israel's legislature than Likud, the political party headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But Gantz won't have enough seats to govern. He'd probably have to form a coalition with Netanyahu to do that, and that's probably not going to happen. So, that brings up another possibility: Israel may have to have a third election to settle the political gridlock. 4. Weather The remnants of Tropical Storm Imelda are  pushing into northern Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana  today, dumping heavy rain along the way. The storm left quite the mess in southeast Texas, where some areas got more than 30 inches of rain. Flooding was so bad in Houston that  hundreds of cars were abandoned  after rising water made some roads impassable. Meanwhile, out in the Atlantic,  Hurricane Jerry has developed . It's a Category 1 storm right now and is expected to pass just north of the Leeward Islands today before moving north of Puerto Rico and the Bahamas over the weekend. 5. Climate strike If your co-worker or classmate isn't around today, it may not be because they're getting an early jump on the weekend. They could be on strike. Global climate strikes are taking place today all over the world, with people walking out of workplaces and classrooms  to demand action to address the climate crisis . It's expected to be the biggest day of climate demonstrations in history. More than  100,000 people gathered in Melbourne , Australia.

"Former Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign chief strategist Mark Penn reacts to the latest numbers. Former Vice President  Joe Biden’s  many gaffes don’t mean he’s mentally unfit to be president, but if they raise enough questions with voters they might prevent him from getting the Democratic presidential nomination, or from getting elected if he becomes the nominee. Biden, his two leading competitors in the Democratic presidential primaries and  President Trump  are all in their 70s. The oldest is Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 78, followed by Biden at 76, Trump at 73, and Sen. Elizabeth of Warren of Massachusetts at 70. Are all four too old for what is probably one of the most intellectually challenging jobs in the world, with enormous power over our lives and the future of the planet? FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN AT NEW LOW IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE Biden, Sanders, Warren and Trump all keep demanding and high-pressure schedules, traveling frequently, often getting little sleep, and speaking on an almost daily basis in front of TV cameras to answer questions from reporters and to address audiences large and small. That takes stamina and a quick mind. But because they speak in public so often and most of what they say is recorded, each of them sometimes generates news stories when saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. Biden, however, seems to exceed the average for the number of these gaffes. And because the former vice president’s frequent gaffes have now become an issue raising questions about his fitness to serve as president, they are getting outsized attention in the media and from his opponents. Still, at this early stage in the 2020 presidential race Biden remains the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. A  Fox News poll  that came out this week shows Biden has the support of 29 percent of likely Democratic primary voters, compared with 18 percent for Sanders and 16 percent for Warren. However, Biden’s solid lead was down by two points since August and six points since May. Biden has almost universal name recognition among voters from his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president and 36 years in the Senate before that. A centrist who doesn’t embrace the more far-left policies of Sanders and Warren, Biden has strong appeal for many voters because of his more moderate positions and because they believe he can make Trump a one-term president. But what about all the Biden gaffes? His critics are raising questions about his mental fitness and whether he could be suffering from the early stages of dementia that could grow markedly worse at the end of a potential two terms in the White House. So far the Democratic presidential candidate going after Trump most directly on the mental fitness issue is former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, who aggressively attacked Biden in the last presidential debate, accusing Biden of forgetting a comment he had made just minutes earlier. But it turns out that Castro was the one who forgot what Biden said. Does the fact that Castro got mixed up mean he is suffering from dementia? Look, dementia isn’t diagnosed by watching someone on a podium at a televised debate, where candidates are required to instantly respond to questions and sum up complex issues in a minute or less. And once in office, presidents have advisers and briefings and time to learn and think about issues. No one is ever going to say to a president: Sir (or someday Madam), tell me in 60 seconds how to end terrorism, or end poverty, or improve our educational system, or balance the federal budget. And when we look at Biden’s gaffes and question if he is possibly “losing it” or if he’s fit for office, we shouldn’t forget that President Trump certainly has made quite a few gaffes of his own. More importantly, according to The Washington Post’s  Fact Checker database , as of Aug. 5 Trump “had made 12,019 false or misleading claims.” “President Trump’s proclivity for spouting exaggerated numbers, unwarranted boasts and outright falsehoods has continued at a remarkable pace,” a Post article reported. Of course, the president and his supporters strongly dispute the Post tally, and the president regularly denounces the newspaper as biased against him and as purveying “fake news.” But if voters are concerned about instances where Biden gets a bit confused at times and inadvertently says the wrong thing, they should be even more concerned about Trump’s “false and misleading claims.” We all accidentally say the wrong thing sometimes and forget things or remember past events incorrectly. Those are innocent mistakes. And we all age differently. Some people are past their peak mental performance in their 60s and some even have dementia at that age. Others are just fine mentally in their 80s and even beyond. Space doesn’t permit a listing of all Biden’s gaffes, simply because there are so many. But importantly, he’s been making these gaffes for decades, going back to when he was a young man and in middle age. That hasn’t prevented him from devoting a lifetime to public service and accomplishing a great deal for the American people. But let’s look at just a few of Biden’s gaffes. Recently Biden has urged parents to keep “record players” on to improve the vocabulary of their children. He said he was in Vermont when he was really in New Hampshire. Biden said in August that he was still vice president at the time of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb.14, 2018 – when he had been out of office for more than a year.  An official with Biden’s campaign later said Biden had meant to refer to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, which occurred in December 2012. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER And one of Biden’s gaffes, which was a favorite for many and quite funny, came during CNN’s July 31 presidential debate, when he asked voters to “go to Joe 30330.” He said later he meant to say “text.” “I was so focused on making the case for Joe, I said ‘Joe’ and I gave the number,” he said. According to the Alzheimer’s Association: “There is no one test to determine if someone has dementia.  Doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia based on a careful medical history, a physical examination, laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day function and behavior associated with each type.” I’m not a doctor and I certainly can’t diagnose Biden’s mental abilities. But you would think if he really was slipping mentally his own doctors, his wife, other family members and the people who work with him every day would notice something was seriously wrong. And you would think Biden himself would notice and conclude for his own health and for the good of the country he deeply loves that he should withdraw from the presidential race – or resign from the presidency, should he become president and be stricken with dementia. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The bottom line is that opponents attack each other in campaigns. This has begun happening in the 2020 presidential race and is going to get a lot worse. As the Democratic front-runner, Biden is a magnet for attacks – as always happens with front-runners. My best advice to Biden is to focus on trying to reduce the number of gaffes he makes, working with his top advisers. He has an outstanding record in government and shouldn’t be pushed out of the race for slips of the tongue, as long as they don’t indicate he has more serious problems that make him unfit to be our next president.

"Per a  CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll  released Saturday, Warren has for the first time taken the lead among likely caucusgoers in that key first primary state, climbing seven points since June. And Warren appears poised to rise further if other Democrats drop out or falter in the race, given that the poll finds she's the top second choice among all other Democratic candidates. Twenty percent would choose Warren as a second choice while Biden and Bernie Sanders are each only the  second choice of 10% .  Biden still currently leads Warren in the Real Clear Politics average of polls on a national level by a  little over ten points .  But Warren has been slowly building support in a way that may not only lead her to win the nomination, but to win the White House come 2020. Why? It's simple: Warren is increasingly exciting people about her candidacy. This is backed by a new NBC/WSJ poll released Sunday which finds that among all the 2020 Democratic candidates, she is now the top-tier candidate who the largest amount of registered voters (17%) are "" enthusiastic "" about. While that number has grown from just 8 percent in March, the percentage of voters who are enthusiastic about Trump has remained the same at 26%. Biden, however, has seen the opposite trend. In March, 17% of voters were enthusiastic about him, but now the former VP has slipped to 12%. That's not good. Enthusiasm should only be growing the more people see a candidate in debates and on the campaign trail. True, enthusiasm is an intangible factor that can come and go, often quickly. But it's enthusiasm that inspires people to not just vote, but to get friends to vote. It's that passion that animates people to knock on doors for a candidate, make phone calls, give money and attend events. In fact, just this past week, we saw an example of Warren enthusiasm on display when she held a rally in New York City and some  20,000 people  reportedly attended. The massive crowd clearly unnerved Trump, who loves to brag that he draws the largest audiences. When asked about the rally by reporters, Trump did his best to downplay it,  saying , ""No. 1, she didn't have 20,000 people and No. 2, I think anybody would get a good crowd there.""  But it wasn't just the New York City rally, Warren has been  increasingly drawing impressive, energetic crowds,  such as in August when 15,000 people came to her rally in Seattle and 12,000 attended another rally in St. Paul, Minnesota.  How did Warren climb from  single digits  in national polls in March to now topping Biden in the new Iowa poll?  She hit all the right notes with Democrats and especially with the progressive wing of the party. Her debate performances have been consistently very good. Warren's  'I have a plan for that' mantra  where she has released detailed plans for policy issues facing our nation from childcare to anti-corruption to criminal justice reform --  and the list goes on  -- has resonated with voters. She has also been very outspoken on another issue supported by approximately  70% of Democrats : Impeaching Trump.  Warren was the first major presidential candidate to  call for impeaching the President  back in April, just days after Robert Mueller's report was released. And on Friday after  allegations were reported  that Trump spoke to the Ukrainian President in July and pressured him to investigate Biden and Biden's son Hunter in an obvious effort to get dirt on Biden, Warren went a step further.  She took to Twitter slamming Democrats in Congress for failing to act, writing, ""After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment. By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump's latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections.""  She added , ""Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president.""  In contrast,  Biden's first response  to reporters on the issue was understandably more defensive: ""Not one single credible outlet has given credibility to these assertions. Not one single one,"" adding, ""So I have no comment other than the president should start to be president."" Later that night Biden put out  a more forceful statement  saying if the allegations are true, it is ""clear-cut corruption.""   However, as someone who speaks to the progressives nightly on my SiriusXM radio show, I can tell you firsthand that Warren's words and sentiment line up perfectly with the frustration many rank and file Democrats have with the Democrats in Congress on this issue.  Between now and the 2020 election a great deal can change. But if Warren and Biden continue along their current trajectory, Trump should fear Warren as much, if not more, than Biden."
"Although neither candidate holds a clear lead at this point, the new poll finds Warren and Biden well ahead of other contenders for the Democratic nomination. Sen.  Bernie Sanders ' support has dipped to 11% in this poll, with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor  Pete Buttigieg  at 9% and Sen.  Kamala Harris  at 6%. Sens.  Cory Booker  and  Amy Klobuchar  each land at 3%, while Rep.  Tulsi Gabbard , former Rep.  Beto O'Rourke , investor  Tom Steyer  and businessman  Andrew Yang  each have the backing of 2% of likely caucusgoers. The poll marks Gabbard's third qualifying poll for inclusion in October's Democratic debates. The rest of the field each notched 1% or less. Warren's improved standing overall in the Iowa poll comes on the heels of a stronger showing in recent national polls and is bolstered by an increasing positive favorability rating (75% have a favorable view, the best in the field, and she is one of only four candidates who have improved their net favorability since the June CNN/DMR poll), as well as a growing percentage of likely caucusgoers who say she is either their first choice, second choice or someone they are actively considering. All told, 71% are at least considering Warren's candidacy, ahead of the next best candidate on that score by 11 points (Biden at 60%). Her supporters are also more enthusiastic than those behind Biden (32% of her backers are extremely enthusiastic vs. 22% for the former vice president). The Massachusetts senator appears to be gaining ground primarily at the expense of Sanders. She holds the support of 32% of those who say they caucused for Sanders in 2016 (Sanders himself stands at 25% among that group), stands at 48% among those who consider themselves ""very liberal,"" and for the first time in CNN/DMR polling on the race, has edged ahead of Sanders among those under age 35 (27% back Warren, 22% Sanders). Biden's core backers remain behind him in largely the same way they were in the previous poll. Among seniors, he is the first choice of 35%, about the same as earlier this year. And he remains above 30% support with moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers. And Warren's supporters are a bit less apt to be locked in than are those backing Biden (12% of Warren supporters say their mind is made up vs. 26% of Biden's supporters). Overall, though, just 20% of likely caucusgoers say their mind is made up now, suggesting there is plenty of room for these preferences to shift before February. Shifts in favorability For many in the field, a summer spent campaigning in Iowa has done little to improve their chances there. Aside from Warren, no candidate has made meaningful gains in overall support compared with their backing among likely caucus attendees in June, and 10 candidates saw their unfavorable ratings rise by double-digits without an equivalent rise on the positive side of things, including a whopping 30-point increase in negative views of author Marianne Williamson, a 23-point jump for former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro and increases in the teens for former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. Sanders and Biden each saw an increase in unfavorable views alongside a drop in favorable ratings (Sanders shifted from 70% favorable and 25% unfavorable to a 58% favorable to 36% unfavorable rating; Biden's favorable numbers dipped 6 points to 66% while his unfavorable rating rose 5 to 29%). Yang also saw his unfavorable numbers grow, but the rise was matched by the increase in his favorability rating. Beyond Warren's gains, Buttigieg boosted his favorable rating 8 points to 69% without an appreciable rise in unfavorable views, Klobuchar saw favorable views gain 6 points to top 50% for the first time, while her unfavorable numbers rose 4 points, and Booker's favorability climbed 5 points to 60% as the unfavorable side gained just 3 points. Prioritizing electability Though views on the candidates have shifted, those likely to attend Iowa's Democratic caucuses remain more apt to prioritize nominating a candidate with a strong chance of beating Trump (63%) over one who shares their positions on major issues (31%). And most think that after Trump, American government could return to the way it was before his election (59%). The poll sought to gain insight into what it is likely caucusgoers think an electable candidate would be. Nearly three-quarters said a candidate who can excite new voters (74%) is closer to their vision of electability than one who would excite the base (16%). And most preferred a candidate who would represent a new generation of leadership (57%) over one with a long history in government (28%), as well as one who would take the high road against Trump (54%) vs. getting in the mud as needed to take on the President (35%).  Roughly two-thirds felt the more electable candidate is one who seeks common ground with Republicans (63%) rather than moving the country to the left (28%). But in assessing six positions that have become signatures of the more liberal candidates in the Democratic field, the poll finds wide variation in likely caucusgoers' level of comfort with them. Support for policy positions Clear majorities say that they are personally comfortable with policies that would raise taxes on the wealthy (74%) and restore the ban on assault-style weapons (69%) and they feel candidates ought to run on those positions. Fewer felt the same about the Green New Deal (48%), ""Medicare for All"" (41%), free tuition for public colleges (36%) and moving the country in a socialist direction (20%). Views on Medicare for All in particular are starkly divided between those backing Warren or Sanders -- the strongest proponents of such a plan among the Democratic candidates -- and those who favor other candidates. Among supporters of Warren or Sanders, 63% say they're comfortable with Medicare for All and want candidates to run on it, while among those backing other candidates, just 29% feel the same way. Perceptions on these policy positions are one sharp divider between supporters of the two top candidates. Among Warren's supporters, 64% say that none of the six tested positions are bad policy. Among Biden's backers, though, just 29% feel the same way. The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll was conducted by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, September 14 through 18 among a random sample of 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample of likely caucusgoers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points."
"The genius of Barack Obama lay in the fact that Americans looked at him and could believe in almost anything. The left of the Democratic Party saw the revolutionary incarnation of hope, the promise of sweeping social change, and, in a black president, the overturning of America’s original sin. The center saw a measured  product of Harvard Law School,  a prudent reformer, a man of mixed identity and the middle ground.  Moderates were closer to the mark. Obama, a cool man, proved cautious to a fault. Still, the way he  cloaked  his coolness and masked his aloofness in the language of the heart was brilliant. This time around, there is no such political genius out there among the Democratic contenders.  The field appears to have narrowed to the occasionally befuddled and befuddling Joe Biden as the standard-bearer of moderation, and the nimble, plan-a-minute star of the campaign to date, Elizabeth Warren, with her progressive program of social and fiscal reform. Snapping at their heels, from a growing distance, is Bernie Sanders, with voice raised. His habitual dyspepsia has been sharpened by the way Warren steals his revolutionary thunder. No socialist, she; on the contrary,  Warren calls herself a “capitalist to my bones,”  but ready, unlike Biden, to tax the superrich who have skewed America’s promise. That’s her economic patriotism — a smart way to fight Donald Trump’s economic nationalism.  Some game-changer may yet come along. Biden could blow himself up with a shocking moment of incoherence or insult that goes beyond his known liabilities. He has already come close to that. He will be  more  exposed in the months ahead than he was as vice president at the no-drama White House. If the moderate Democratic ground opens up, the temptation for Michael Bloomberg to fill it may prove overwhelming, or, just possibly, another candidate — Kamala Harris, Cory Booker — will gain that elusive traction.  If Warren widens her lead over Sanders, will he withdraw in a way that might wrap it up for her? Railroaded out in 2016, when the Bernie-buzz was fresh, he will not, I suspect, be inclined to favors. Mr. Magnanimous he is not. Warren will have to fight it out. On the evidence, that will galvanize her. Biden is trying to bridge reassurance to the wealthy with outreach to energized progressives. That balancing act has maintained his lead in polls. If two Obama terms were not enough for you, he’s offering something resembling a third — Obamacare Plus;   a possible increase in capital-gains tax to address inequality.  Will this fine-tuning be enough in an agitated America, whiplashed by President Trump? I doubt it.  The under-30s, maybe under-40s, are underwhelmed by Biden , even angry that this honorable man has not chosen dignified retirement. He’s the emblem of the permanent political class, the one that  created  the conditions for Trump, in an era that Trump’s wild policy lurches and heresies and, yes, lies have now transformed. America’s restoration, after this trauma, will not be achieved by going back. What created Trump cannot oust Trump.   It will demand a new politics, and a new integrity, such as the one Warren has set out and embodied with greater vigor, persuasiveness and coherence than anyone else. Biden, on whom  Trump may have been seeking dirt in a July phone call  with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, can put an end to the president’s sullying of the Oval Office. He can’t, however, embody renewal. Is Warren too far left to win?   Maybe. Does she worry some purple-district Democrats who did well in 2018? Yes. But she can adjust. As for “electability,” an overused word, well, Trump won, and may again, so all bets are off. I said Biden has come close to a blowup moment. The campaign is grueling. You don’t have to be almost 77 to slip up. But he has demonstrated tone-deafness on race in a way that is disturbing. His reference to a  “record player” in the last Democratic debate  in the context of a question about reparations for slavery tied Biden to a bygone era, but that was far from the worst of it. Talking about black families — that is what the question was about — he actually said: “We bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It’s not that they don’t want to help. They don’t, they don’t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television — excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the, the — — make sure the kids hear words.” They don’t know what to do! Make sure the kids hear words ! This is insulting toward African-Americans. It’s of a piece with Biden’s comment (quickly adjusted) in August that “we have this notion that somehow if you’re poor, you cannot do it. Poor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids.” There’s a way, and a need, to talk about fundamental systemic racial injustice, but this is emphatically not it. Black does not equal poor and inept. The genius has left a void. Right now it’s not his vice president who may just fill it enough, but Warren.

"Presidents these days always seem to get worse, don’t they?  To many on the left, Donald Trump is an order of magnitude more disastrous a commander in chief than was George W. Bush, whose reputation now stands thoroughly  rehabilitated  in the popular culture. Bush is no longer the incurious man who launched an unnecessary  war  that killed  hundreds of thousands  in Iraq; today, he’s the goofy old fella who  paints portraits of the troops ,  pals around with Michelle Obama  and seems to be in on the joke of our times.  “Sorta makes me look pretty good, doesn’t it?” Bush  has been reported  to smirk about the Trump era.  For the record, I think the jury is still out on whether Trump is worse than Bush. But for most of 2019, I’ve been trying to picture a future that elevates Trump in the same way it did Bush: How much worse could all t his  get? And worse in what direction — what politics, policies, rhetoric and media mastery will the next extremely terrible president marshal to ruin America anew?  In short: What sort of character do we have to imagine occupying the White House in 2029 to make lefties like myself feel even a slight pang of nostalgia for the good old days of Donald J. Trump?  The thought experiment is instructive because it compels us to ponder some of the fundamental forces shaping American culture and politics at the moment. It is also horrifying, because what quickly becomes evident is that we  might  now be only in the middle of everything spinning out of control.  Come, take a stroll with me through my recurrent nightmare: It’s the sweltering summer of 2029, and the man in charge is Tucker Carlson — that is, President Tucker Carlson, the one-time Fox News talker turned righteous, white nationalist economic populist, now in his triumphant second term, after having defeated the incumbent Joseph “Recession Joe” Biden back in 2024. Like Trump, President Carlson  spends  his first term refashioning America along racial lines. But unlike Trump, whose one term is now regarded by much of the right as a best-forgotten political disaster,  Carlson  advances an ethnonationalist populism that succeeds in  a  wild, frightening fashion. His secret: competence, a commitment to true political realignment, and a brutal online political machine that represents the full flowering of the tactics and ideology first displayed during  2014’s Gamergate  movement. Where Trump was a chaotic, undisciplined narcissist, the Carlson who wins in 2024 is a canny political strategist who makes good on Trump’s forgotten promise to embrace anti-corporate economic policies. On paper, parts of Carlson’s agenda seem ripped from the former liberal firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren (now in exile in Toronto): His  chief enemies  are Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, the megacorporations owned and staffed by wealthy liberals.  It’s a winning electoral formula: A large minority of Americans are willing to forgive Carlson’s authoritarian, nativist impulses if they see it as part of a war against the out-of-touch, culture-destroying corporations that are automating our jobs; killing every other industry; and exercising complete control over what we watch, read, listen to, buy and believe. And in America, thanks to the Electoral College, winning over a large minority is good enough to  regularly win the presidency .  Obviously I am making all of this up. But my premonition is based on months of research — this is what you might call an  educated  nightmare. My education: Carlson’s own nightly Fox News show, which I’ve been watching obsessively since January. I began tuning in because Carlson — who,  with nearly three million viewers a night , is the second most popular host on cable, after Sean Hannity — has become one of the most fascinatingly terrifying men in conservative media.  There are  two  things that terrify and fascinate me about Carlson. First,  unlike  most  Republican  lawmakers today, Carlson is sketching an economic vision of a post-Trump America that departs in key ways from Trumpism, especially in its muscular anti-corporate, populist zeal.  In January,  in a commentary that went viral on the right , Carlson excoriated American political leaders for their commitment to empty capitalism: “For our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer,”  he said . “They teach us it’s more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids.”  He regularly criticizes the tech giants , whom he argues are censoring his and his followers’ views. But he also hates corporations more generally for what he calls their attempts to influence culture and politics (including  by boycotting his show ): His critics,  he said in May , “believe democracy is when a tiny group of rich people imposes its values on everyone else by force.""  In June,  Carlson praised Elizabeth Warren’s plan for “economic patriotism” : “Many of Warren’s policy prescriptions make obvious sense,” he said, wondering why Republicans, including Trump, didn’t join her vision. “What if the Republican leadership here in Washington had bothered to learn the lessons of the 2016 election?” The second thing that scares me about Carlson is his racism, which is both more extreme and more cannily packaged for a digital audience than is Trump’s.  While Trump is a creature of cable television, Carlson’s segments look like extended YouTube clips, and they’re designed to play to an audience that is  extremely online.  His critics and  white supremacists themselves  point out that, more than anyone else on television, Carlson functions as a kind of  laundromat for white identity movements : Several times a week, he’ll lift ideas, story lines and troll-based narratives directly from the fetid swamp of online hatred. Then he’ll clean these theories up and wrap them in a bow for his mainstream audience, usually to advance an overarching idea that he mentions constantly: that, thanks to  an “invasion” of immigrants , white people in America and Europe face economic and cultural calamity, and that the political, corporate and media establishments are abetting their destruction.  “No one covers white identity more consistently than Tucker,” said Madeline Peltz, who  watches Carlson’s show every night  as a researcher for Media Matters for America, a liberal advocacy group that tracks conservative outlets. “I cannot remember a single episode in the last two years that didn’t include these  ideas. ” I’d known all this before I started watching, but actually watching blew my mind: Carlson’s propaganda was so constant, and the sleight of hand with which he inserted barely sanitized racist theories into his broadcast so swift, that I began to see the outlines of my nightmare — that Trump was only a prelude, and that even if he loses next year, someone far more sophisticated than our current president could come along to push digitally mediated politics in an even darker direction.  Carlson — who talks often with Trump, and was reportedly instrumental in advising Trump against  attacking Iran in June  —  recently disclaimed any interest in running for president . He has been a nimble shape-shifter over the course of his career (a decade ago,  he was a libertarian ), so it’s possible that his latest critiques of capitalism are  just an act .  But he may also have noticed that  there are lots of conservative voters in America who don’t care for the Republican Party’s giveaways to corporations . Hence the outlines of a political vision: Carlson is aiming to mix a lefty-sounding economic agenda with a white nationalist-inspired cultural agenda — and to muddy the marriage by arguing that his and his followers’ ideas are being  stifled by the tech giants that he’s fighting .  This is Carlson’s entire schtick. He uses the cover of capitalist hardship to advance theories of white oppression, often  while summoning further harassment of his critics . He’s taking it to television, five nights a week. And where it ends up could be hellish. Office Hours With Farhad Manjoo Farhad wants to  chat with readers on the phone .

"President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani on his conversation with Ukraine officials. Just hours after Rep.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y., said her party's failure so far to impeach President Trump  amounted to a major ""national scandal,""  House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi  appeared to relent on Sunday -- and warn that a ""whole new stage of investigation"" could be approaching. Pelosi, who has  long resisted calls to impeach Trump  because the move would  imperil the electability of moderate Democrats  in the House, outlined her new stance in a statement Sunday. Pelosi specifically said that a whistleblower who reportedly alleged that  Trump acted improperly  during a July 25 phone call with  Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy must be allowed to speak to Congress, and the full whistleblower complaint must be provided. Her aggressive push came as top Republicans, including California Rep. Devin Nunes, predicted that the gambit  would backfire for Democrats . Later in the evening, Trump sounded a similar note, saying the ""real story"" was that ""Sleepy Joe Biden"" had ""forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by the threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine."" The whistleblower drama escalated after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump repeatedly had asked Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son who had a key role in a natural gas firm that a Ukrainian prosecutor had been investigating as part of a corruption probe. At a conference two years after he left office, Joe Biden  openly bragged  about successfully pressuring Ukraine to  fire that prosecutor  when he was vice president. CNN  later reported the whistleblower had no direct knowledge of the call, and a top  Ukrainian  official on Saturday  defended Trump's  actions. Unverified reports  circulated on left-leaning media outlets  claiming that Trump could have promised something improper in exchange for Ukraine's compliance, although the Journal reported there was no ""quid-pro-quo"" involved. But if Democrats' demands were not met, Pelosi said, the Trump administration's ""grave new chapter of lawlessness"" would necessitate drastic action. ""We must be sure that the President and his Administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President’s personal or political interest,"" Pelosi said. FLASHBACK: IN APRIL, TRUMP SAYS HILLARY-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' WILL BE INVESTIGATED Speaking to CNN's ""State of the Union,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also said impeachment was on the table. Schiff previously has claimed to have  hard evidence  that the Trump team improperly colluded with Russia. “Why doesn’t the president just say, ‘Release the whistleblower complaint.’ Clearly he’s afraid for the public to see,” Schiff said. “This would be the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions.” “We may have crossed the Rubicon here,” he added, referring to the river that Julius Caesar fatefully traversed in 49 BC. “I have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment. ... but that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that that conduct represents.” The top Democrats' rhetoric came soon after Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday night kickstarted a  dormant, but long-simmering and occasionally explosive feud  with top House Democrats in the form of a fiery  tweet:  ""At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it."" Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a closed-door meeting in July, in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. That meeting came shortly before the departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti. Trump  acknowledged Sunday  that he had communicated with Zelensky about Biden, and that the conversation concerned ""the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."" The president and top officials maintained Sunday that nothing inappropriate occurred on the call. GIULIANI CLARIFIES CONFUSING CNN COMMENTS ON UKRAINE Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, has long said publicly he  wanted Ukraine to look into the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine , and  admitted this week  that he's asked Ukraine to do so in the past -- but denied any impropriety or illegal conduct again on Sunday. ""This violation is about our national security,"" Pelosi said. ""The Inspector General determined that the matter is 'urgent' and therefore we face an emergency that must be addressed immediately."" Inspector General Michael Atkinson of the office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) wrote in a Sep. 9 letter to the House Intelligence Committee that the whistleblower complaint ""appeared credible"" and related to an ""urgent"" matter. But, the DNI general counsel said days later that, after consulting with the DOJ, the matter did not meet the legal definition of an ""urgent concern,"" and was not subject to mandatory disclosure to Congress. Trump's conversation came as the White House was holding up $250 million in military aid for Ukraine, money that the White House later released. The president has said he wanted European countries to pay more for their own defense, and  denied delaying any military aid funding. HOUSE INTEL RANKING REPUBLICAN: THIS IS THE END OF THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN ""Furthermore, because the complaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community, the DNI lacks unilateral authority to transmit such materials to the intelligence committees,"" Jason Klitenic, the DNI general counsel, wrote. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee at an open hearing on Thursday. In her statement, Pelosi said Democrats would be watching closely. ""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,"" Pelosi said. ""Thank you for your patriotism."" Even some Republicans cautioned that the situation could be serious. Utah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney, a onetime Trump presidential rival,  tweeted  that ""If the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival,"" that ""would be troubling in the extreme."" At the same time, California  Rep. Devin Nunes  predicted on Fox News'  ""Sunday Morning Futures""  that  Biden's  campaign is likely coming to an end -- all because of the newly resurfaced reports about his  possible misconduct in Ukraine  that ""first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race."" The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee made the claim as  The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll  showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren  surging ahead of Biden  as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. Biden held a 9-point lead over Warren in the poll as recently as June. Indeed, the whistleblower's allegation could prompt scrutiny of the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Joe Biden has explained on camera that in March 2016, he  privately threatened then-President Petro Poroshenko  that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if its top prosecutor was not fired. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER BACKS UP TRUMP, SAYS THERE WAS NO PRESSURE ""I said, 'You're not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.'"" ""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden continued, after assuring Poroshenko that Obama knew about the arrangement. ""And, they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" It remained unclear if this was directly tied to the prosecutor's probe into the company linked to Hunter Biden, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. And earlier this year, The Hill  reported  that the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, under the Obama administration, took the unusual step of pressuring prosecutors there to drop a probe into a group closely linked to liberal megadonor George Soros. WATCH: POMPEO DEFENDS TRUMP AMID WHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGATION Then, in April, Ukrainian law enforcement officials said they had a  slew of evidence of collusion and wrongdoing by Democrats , and that they'd been trying to share this information with U.S. officials in the Justice Department. A  2017 investigation by Politico  found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory. Trump  told Fox News  that the allegations of possible Clinton-Ukraine collusion were ""big"" and vowed the DOJ would review them. ""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better."" ""The longer we talk about what the Bidens did in Ukraine, the better,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, who dismissed those who claimed Trump will pay a political price for the latest controversy. Meanwhile, Biden on Saturday denied he has ever spoken to Hunter about his business in Ukraine and called Trump's actions an ""overwhelming abuse of power."" WATCH: LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS NO ONE HAS REALLY LOOKED INTO BIDENS AND THEIR DEALINGS IN UKRAINE ""Trump’s doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum, and he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" Biden  told reporters in Iowa . Trump, on Sunday, pointed out that Biden's claim was seemingly inaccurate. Hunter Biden told the  New Yorker  previously that he and his father had spoken ""just once"" about it. ""And now, he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,"" Trump said. ""Of course you spoke to your son!"" Trump added: ""No quid pro quo, there was nothing. It was a perfect conversation. ... The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine, and Ukraine has got a lot of problems. The new president is saying that he's going to be able to rid the country of corruption and I said that would be a great thing, we had a great conversation."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump went on to say the latest allegations are ""just as ridiculous as the others,"" branding it ""the Ukraine Witch Hunt"" — a nod to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

"California Republican Rep. Devin Nunes on the whistleblower complaint against Trump, the IG report on alleged FISA abuse and privacy concerns with big tech. California  Rep. Devin Nunes  predicted on Fox News'  ""Sunday Morning Futures""  that  Joe Biden's  campaign is likely coming to an end -- all because of newly resurfaced reports about his  possible misconduct in Ukraine  that ""first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure Biden didn’t get in the race.""

We want to hear from that whistleblower, but it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And, like I said, it looks like this is the end of Biden’s campaign. I really do... his lead is basically down to zero."" Late Sunday, Trump echoed Nunes' comments, and emphasized that Biden recently  bragged  about pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor when he was vice president.

""Sleepy Joe Biden ... forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""That's the real story!"" Nunes said the ever-deepening schism in the Democratic Party over whether to impeach the president -- highlighted late Saturday when New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  called it a major ""scandal"" that Democrats hadn't yet voted to impeach  -- would help Trump in 2020. ""The more I think that they’re out there promoting this kind of craziness and silliness, the more that the American people are put off, and the more likely President Trump is reelected,” Nunes added. There were parallels, Nunes said, with Democrats' ultimately debunked claims that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. ""This has all the hallmarks of the Russia hoax,"" Nunes said. ""Something leaks out. ... and then it's the same reporters that report on it, the same reporters that reported on the Russia hoax. Then you move forward, and what happens? Then supposedly they come and testify -- and the night before they testify, the whistleblower who supposedly doesn't want anybody to know who this person is, or what information they have, well, it's spilled all over the pages of the Washington Post"" the day before Congress was briefed on the matter.

"President Trump says his conversation with the Ukraine was perfect; he says Joe Biden made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son about his overseas business dealings. President Trump  answered questions Sunday morning regarding reports that a whistleblower complaint may have accused him of wrongdoing related to a July phone call with  Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and insisted that there was “absolutely nothing wrong” with the substance of the discussion. Trump reportedly has been accused of asking Ukraine’s leader multiple times to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, and using military aid as leverage. Trump denied making any improper requests. UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE' “I said absolutely nothing wrong; it was perfect,” Trump said outside the White House before departing for Houston. “There was no quid pro quo, there was nothing,” he later added. Trump did point fingers at Biden, however. The Democratic presidential hopeful’s son Hunter Biden had been investigated related to business interests. Biden has said in the past that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden’s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well. Trump accused Biden of being dishonest in claiming that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company, despite Hunter Biden telling the  New Yorker  that they spoke “just once” about it. “And now he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,” Trump said Sunday. “Of course you spoke to your son!” When asked about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump said it had nothing to do with the Biden family. ""Because I want Germany, and I want France, and I want the European Union to put up money,"" Trump said. ""And I didn't delay anything. We paid the military aid to the best of my knowledge."" BIDEN FACES SCRUTINY FOR DEMANDING OUSTER OF UKRAINE OFFICIAL PROBING FIRM THAT EMPLOYED HIS SON Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., doubted that Trump's conversation with Zelenskiy was innocent. ""Well if that’s the case, then why doesn’t the president simply release the transcript of that call?” Schiff said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Schiff also challenged Trump to allow the release of the whistleblower complaint, accusing Trump of not wanting to see either one. The Democratic congressman has long been a vocal critic of the president but has not been among those calling for his impeachment. Schiff said that may change in light of the reports of Trump's conversation with Ukraine. ""If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit … then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents.” Giuliani has acknowledged that he was involved in investigating Hunter Biden, but claimed that his original goal was to investigate ties between Ukraine and Democrats related to the 2016 election. He denied that he was specifically out to get Biden. “What they’re trying to say is I went there on a political mission to get Joe Biden in trouble,” Giuliani told “Fox News Sunday,” calling such a claim “ridiculous.” Giuliani said that the suspicion of Biden’s wrongdoing related to his son’s case was “inextricably linked” to what he had already been investigating related to the Democratic Party. “This is going to get bigger and bigger, and everything I say I can prove,” Giuliani said. Trump said he would be amenable to Giuliani discussing the matter before Congress. “I would have no problem,” the president said. “Rudy’s a straight shooter, and Rudy wants to see the same thing as a lot of other people when it comes to Ukraine.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also fielded questions about Ukraine on “Fox News Sunday,” but declined to get into specifics, only stating that Trump’s discussions with world leaders “have always been 100 percent appropriate, 100 percent lawful.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"
