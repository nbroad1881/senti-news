"The Wall Street Journal reports that in a July phone call, President Trump repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son. The controversy over President Trump’s  mysterious call  with a foreign leader that prompted a whistleblower complaint ratcheted up Friday afternoon as a new report said it involved Trump asking the president of Ukraine numerous times in a single phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. Meanwhile, after Trump called the whistleblower a partisan and dismissed the allegation as “another political hack job,” Democrats in Congress accused the president of trying to intimidate whistleblowers and demanded the administration hand over the complaint and a transcript of the call, while 2020 hopefuls renewed calls for impeachment. CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. In a lengthy statement Friday evening, Biden said that if the reports were true ""there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.  ""This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,"" Biden continued. ""It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation—a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia—pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor ..."" ""At minimum,"" Biden concluded, ""Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress."" What initially touched off the  controversy is a secret  whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM   Trump called that initial story “ridiculous” in the Oval Office, and said he doesn’t know the identity of the whistleblower. He wouldn’t say what was discussed in the call but said someone should “look into” Biden family connections to Ukraine. ""I have conversations with many leaders. It's always appropriate. Always appropriate,"" Trump said. ""At the highest level, always appropriate. And anything I do, I fight for this country."" Afterward, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democratic committee leaders issued a statement demanding the administration hand over the complaint, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would not share details of it with lawmakers. “President Trump just went on national television—from the Oval Office—and personally attacked an Intelligence Community whistleblower who reported an urgent matter involving serious or flagrant misconduct,"" the statement said, adding that the ""brazen effort to intimidate this whistleblower risks a chilling effect on future whistleblowers."" After the publication of the Journal’s story, 2020 Democrats quickly weighed in. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro said that Trump “is a criminal.” “He must be impeached immediately,” he said. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said that Trump “appears to be collaborating with foreign governments to attack America’s democracy” before she urged the whistleblower to come forward. “I would absolutely urge this whistleblower to go directly to Congress, whether in closed session or in open session,” she said. Schiff told reporters Friday that the whistleblower claim ""deserves a thorough investigation."" ""Come hell or high water, that’s what we’re going to do,” he said. Democrats have been looking into whether Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure the government to investigate the Biden activities, and have also sought a transcript of the July call between Trump and Zelensky. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The inspector general for the intelligence community received the whistleblower complaint and, according to correspondence with Schiff, considered the allegations “credible” and dealing with an “urgent concern.” Inspector General Michael Atkinson wrote that the DNI, “after consulting with the Department of Justice,” determined the complaint does not have to be shared with the intelligence committees under law. He wrote that he will “abide by that determination,” but disagrees with it. In a letter Tuesday, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of ""urgent concern."" He said the complaint ""concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision."" Maguire is expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. after being subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee. Schiff had accused Maguire of withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioned whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general.

"HOUSTON — A groan erupted at a  debate  watch party at Texas Southern University last week as former vice president  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  got a question about slavery and racism and  gave an answer about Venezuela and record players .  But amid that exasperation, some students channeled their inner Beltway operatives and began a targeted  rapid-response campaign.   Tyler Smith, 19, texted his grandmother after the debate, hopeful that Mr. Biden's meandering answer may have swayed her from supporting him.  Amaya St. Romain, 19, mounted a three-day lobbying blitz on her mother and her great-grandmother, making sure they had seen the former housing secretary  Julián Castro ’s criticisms of Mr. Biden onstage.  In  meme-speak ,  the efforts amounted to Killmonger, the villain in the Black Panther movie, challenging the people of Wakanda:  “Is this your king?”   “I think I’m definitely influencing them,” Ms. St. Romain said of her family members. “But my dad is definitely still pro-Biden. And I don’t really argue with him.”  If Mr. Biden,  76 , is going to win the  Democratic nomination , it is likely to be because of the  support of older black voters , a key constituency for the party  and one that polls show is overwhelmingly supportive of the former vice president’s candidacy .  But if he is to be overtaken by one of his more progressive rivals, the most powerful tool against him may not be opposition research or negative advertisements. Instead, it may be an organic effort by younger black voters — concerned about Mr. Biden’s age and more moderate ideology — to sway their older family members. Mr. Biden seems aware of this dynamic. In interviews, he has both acknowledged the generational gap among his black supporters and downplayed its importance,  arguing that the support of older, more moderate black voters  would be enough to give him an electoral advantage.  Still, Mr. Biden, by his own admission, would be unwise to underestimate the lobbying efforts of those who are young and politically engaged. At a gathering of the New Hampshire Young Democrats in July, Mr. Biden said the same phenomenon — young people converting their skeptical parents — had helped fuel his own ascension in politics almost 47 years ago, when he was elected to the Senate as a fresh-faced 29-year-old.  “The fact of the matter is, you have more influence on how your parents vote than they have on you,” Mr. Biden  said  in July. “You may sit at the dining room table, having dinner with your mom and dad, and say, ‘I met her and I really like her,’ or ‘I met him and I really like him.’ And your parents will pretend it didn’t matter much. But they’ll go up, not a joke, they’ll go up and say, ‘If my kid liked that person that much, and knew them, there must be something there.’”  At Texas Southern University, a historically black university founded in 1927 and the site of last week’s Democratic debate, dozens of students, ages 19 to 23, differed on their top candidate. Senators  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont,  Elizabeth Warren  of Massachusetts, and  Kamala Harris  of California were among the favorites, as was one of the two Texans in the race, former Representative  Beto O’Rourke .  For Mr. Biden, though, students carried mixed feelings. They respected his tenure as Barack Obama’s vice president, but implicitly rejected his campaign’s central premise, that the primary goal of Democrats in the 2020 election should be defeating President Trump.  They pointed to systemic problems they said the country must address, such as inequality, climate change and gun violence. The Democratic nominee, they said, should embrace progressive proposals like canceling student loan debt, the Green New Deal and gun buyback programs.  “Me and my dad have the debate all the time,” said Samantha Williams, 19, a sophomore. “We want a candidate that reflects us and what the world is going to look like when we run. But  he  says what we call ‘woke’ is really just sensitive.”  Jaylan Jones, 20, said, “Older people have that conservative outlook on things,” even older black Democrats.  “Young people don’t want Biden. We want Beto. We want Bernie,” said Ms. Jones, a junior. “I think we can convince them.”  The difference in opinion across generations speaks to the changing politics of black communities, said Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, the racial justice organization.  And the  historically diverse Democratic field  has given voters plentiful options to choose from: multiple black candidates, white progressives  who openly back once-radical ideas like reparations , and Mr. Biden, who served as vice president to the first black president.  Black voters are overwhelmingly members of the Democratic Party, and polls show they have long regarded Mr. Trump as a racist president and individual whom they are desperate to replace. A  recent national poll  of Democratic primary voters from NBC and The Wall Street Journal showed Mr. Biden had the support of nearly 50 percent with black respondents, though others have shown a less commanding lead. “Black people are strategic voters, particularly older black people,” Mr. Robinson said. “They’re thinking harm reduction. They’re doing a deep analysis about what they think white people will accept and won’t accept.” He pointed to the last Democratic primary, when younger black voters tracked more toward Mr. Sanders than their older counterparts, who overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton. In 2008, younger black voters supported Barack Obama in much bigger numbers than the electorate at large, until his victory in the Iowa Caucus led to a surge of support.  “Young people are constantly signaling what’s next and what’s possible,” Mr. Robinson said. “And while there’s some love for Biden, but sometimes you’re in a relationship because you’re comfortable and it’s what you know.”  Another Texas Southern student, Christopher Anwuri, 22, said the generational differences in how black voters saw the primary were fueled by opposing theories of political change: incrementalism versus immediate upheaval.  “This generation is looking for an instant, quick fix for problems,” he said. Older black people, meanwhile, think “these things need to take time.”  It also comes back to Mr. Obama, and  the long shadow he casts over national Democratic politics , particularly in black communities. Older black voters invoke his name in deference, and cite his embrace of  Mr. Biden  as something that helped him win the trust of skeptical white voters in 2008.  To younger generations, many of whom were in high school or younger at the time, Mr. Obama’s achievements exist on their own. Their first memories of Mr. Biden stem from his highly meme-able vice-presidential years. They are also more likely to hold his long and at times controversial record — on  criminal justice ,  school segregation  and the  Clarence Thomas hearings , among other things — against him.  Jayla Lee, 19, said older black voters “like Biden because he was with Obama, and they feel like since they could trust Obama that means they can trust him.”  “But the things we endure are not the things they endured,” Ms. Lee said. “And I’m looking for someone who can change the things that affect me.”  Darren Black, 22, said older generations were always “going to ride” for Mr. Biden, because “Joe was there with Obama.”  “But the younger generation, we've seen mass shootings, we’re seeing more police brutality — we’re looking at different things,” Mr. Black said.  Yet contrary to their stereotype as idealistic and apathetic, and with the steely pessimism of seasoned political operatives, younger voters expressed a cleareyed understanding that their efforts to lobby their relatives would not necessarily be successful.  Asked if she’d had any luck converting her family to more progressive candidates, Ms. Williams, a political science major, said, “I’m making no progress. None. Not even a tiny bit. I wish.” Ms. Williams called her pro-Biden father a lost cause. “We’re both opinionated and headstrong people, a nd I just don’t have the energy to go back and forth,” she said.  Mr. Smith, a member of the school’s College Democrats, said he liked Mr. Biden, but preferred his more left-wing rivals, such as Mr. O’Rourke, Mr. Castro, Ms. Harris or Ms. Warren.  After the debate, he thought about further pestering his grandmother over her support for Mr. Biden, but he reconsidered out of fear of coming off as pushy.  “You know, it’s grandma, so you got to let her have it,” Mr. Smith said.  When reached by phone, however, Mr. Smith’s grandmother, Alice Varnado, said his previous lobbying efforts had been more successful than he may have realized.  Ms. Varnado, 69, said she still preferred Mr. Biden, but that she had grown concerned about his age in recent months. She said she would vote for whichever Democrat earned the nomination, but she now considers Ms. Warren her second choice.  Her family members — Mr. Smith and his uncle — had convinced her. “You know, since talking with my grandson and my son, I think I can go with her,” said Ms. Varnado. “I’m starting to like her. There’s been a turning point.”  Katie Glueck contributed reporting."
"Elizabeth Warren  did not want a goodbye party. She told her aides there would be no grand send-off, no celebration of a mission accomplished. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had been her idea from the start: a new arm of the government, uniquely empowered to police the kinds of loans and financial schemes that led to the Great Recession. Ms. Warren had detailed the idea in a journal article, then cajoled and pressured Congress to make it law. She was tasked by President Barack Obama in 2010 with setting up the bureau, and spent a year recruiting investigators and enforcers for an office they saw as an exhilarating cause. But as spring turned to summer in 2011, Ms. Warren faced a wrenching separation. The White House had decided not to nominate her to lead the bureau permanently. So she gathered the staff for an “all hands” meeting and told them her work there was over. “She told us that we were ready to sail the ship, that we did not need her there, and that we would be able to do it on our own,” said Patricia McCoy, a Boston College law professor who was a senior official at the bureau. Ms. Warren was right. Under her successor, Richard A. Cordray, the bureau would recover $12 billion for consumers from financial institutions by 2017. It would become, to supporters, a prized example of the government taking on big banks after the 2008 financial crisis. To opponents — Republican lawmakers, business associations and a few conservative Democrats — it would become an example of “runaway government,” an agency to be curbed at the first  opportunity . To Ms. Warren, the bureau is something else as well: a formative lesson in how an idea — a plan — can become reality. For it was through creating a new financial regulator that Ms. Warren developed the approach to government that now guides her  presidential campaign . And it was in losing the chance to lead her bureau that Ms. Warren came to see the value of asking voters, rather than a president, to give her power. A review of Ms. Warren’s role in creating the consumer bureau, including interviews with more than 30 people involved in the process, revealed an approach to politics that joins imaginative policy ideas with a keen instinct for mass communication and a willingness to negotiate. On one hand, she marshaled support from progressive activists and helped build public demand for her idea; on the other, she haggled with members of Congress to earn their backing. David Axelrod, who was Mr. Obama’s top political adviser during the battle to create the C.F.P.B., called Ms. Warren’s role a “bona fide credential” for the presidency. “There aren’t that many people who can say they had an idea, wrote about it and ended up bringing it to fruition, in terms of the creation of a whole new government agency with a very focused mission,” Mr. Axelrod said. If some of Ms. Warren’s rivals — and more than a few Democratic voters — question whether her ideas are realistic, she and her supporters answer by pointing to the consumer bureau. At the New Hampshire Democratic Party’s convention this month, supporters of Ms. Warren broke out in chants of, “C-F-P-B! She fights for you, she fights for me!” In a recent interview, Ms. Warren described the creation of the bureau as a “model” for how she would seek to deploy her plans as president. At  a September rally  in Washington Square Park in New York, Ms. Warren likened herself to Frances Perkins, the first secretary of labor — a woman, she said, “who worked the political system relentlessly from the inside, while a sustained movement applied pressure from the outside.” But if the bureau has been an enduring victory for Ms. Warren, it culminated in a painful disappointment.  In the interview, Ms. Warren — an upbeat presence on the campaign trail — became somber when the conversation turned to her exit from the bureau. Asked about her insistence against having a farewell party, her eyes began to  glisten .  “I couldn’t say goodbye to all those people I’d hired and all those people I’d brought in to fight,” Ms. Warren said, speaking slowly and quietly. “I’d made an implicit promise to lead the charge, and I would’ve stayed and led it if I could have. But I couldn’t. And I did not want to say goodbye to all of them.” Ms. Warren’s band of advisers, lawyers, researchers and technicians devised a more discreet send-off. Elizabeth Vale, a former White House official who was among Ms. Warren’s close counselors, said an immense farewell card was made from a “big, big, big piece of cardboard,” stamped with the electric-green logo of the C.F.P.B. and signed by scores of staff members. Still, Ms. Warren, then 62, declined to receive it before a throng of colleagues. “I remember two of us brought it to her,” Ms. Vale said, “and then I remember when she walked out, she just walked out quietly, by herself.” An Idea About Exploding Toasters It all began with Ms. Warren’s decision to write an article in the winter of 2007. She had endured one unhappy brush with Washington, testifying against a bill to tighten the bankruptcy code in a way she feared would burden low-income debtors. The proposal became law in 2005, with Joseph R. Biden Jr., then a senator, as its leading Democratic supporter. Back at Harvard,  where she was teaching law, Ms. Warren began considering a new idea: a proposal for a government regulator to address the issue on which Congress had spurned her advice — the problem of consumer credit and the often-deceptive financial products being offered to ordinary people. She outlined the concept to Kenneth Baer, then 34, a former Clinton administration aide who with several like-minded Democrats had founded a publication, Democracy, to stir an ambitious policy debate among liberals. He was skeptical at first of Ms. Warren’s regulatory proposal, wondering if forming a new government agency represented an “old Democratic way of thinking.” But Mr. Baer and his colleagues were hungry for big ideas to fill what they saw as an intellectual void in the Democratic Party, and he encouraged her to make the case for a new regulator. In a February email to Mr. Baer, Ms. Warren agreed to write it. As she tells it now, she was bursting for the chance. “The idea was ripe,” she said. “I was ready.” A draft of the piece followed in late March. Ms. Warren urged her collaborators to “edit aggressively,” an instruction that proved unnecessary. A copy of her first version reviewed by a reporter shows its now-famous opening was scarcely  changed . “In the U.S. today it is not possible to buy a toaster that has a 1-in-5 chance of bursting into flames and burning down a customer’s house,” Ms. Warren wrote in her draft. “But it is possible to refinance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same 1-in-5 chance of putting the family out on the street — without ever disclosing that  fac t to the homeowner.” When Democracy published Ms. Warren’s article in the summer of 2007, Mr. Baer and his colleagues promoted it — and its author — vigorously, booking Ms. Warren on CNN and winning coverage for her idea in national newspapers. And they promoted it to presidential campaigns, too. A breakthrough came in June when Heather McGhee, a policy adviser to Senator John Edwards, emailed Ms. Warren to say her candidate was about to endorse a new regulator for financial products. By early 2008, Ms. Warren and her sometime editors were musing over email that the proposal could really become law. When Ms. Warren noted praise for her idea in Newsweek, Andrei Cherny, a co-founder of Democracy, wrote back, “Next stop: law of the land!” “I’m working on it!” Ms. Warren replied, signing off with her initials, EW, in lowercase. It had been decades since either political party had tried seriously to impose tougher financial regulations. Even sympathetic Democrats, like Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, questioned the feasibility. Ms. McGhee, who stayed in touch with Ms. Warren after the Edwards campaign ended, said she saw the professor straining to discern what to do and whom to turn to in Washington. “She really was trying to figure out how to have all the right conversations,” Ms. McGhee said. “And then the financial crisis happened.” A Two-Sided Game The Congressional Oversight Panel, a body set up to scrutinize Washington’s bailout of the financial system, did not mention toasters in its “special report” on financial regulation. But the document, issued days after Mr. Obama’s inauguration in 2009, was unmistakable in its suggestion. The report recommended creating a financial regulator that could gather up the fragmented enforcement tools of the federal government and seek to avert another financial crisis. It was a natural suggestion for the oversight body, since Ms. Warren was its chairwoman.  Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader at the time, had named her to the post at the end of 2008, in the throes of a global financial catastrophe that sent unemployment soaring and threw millions of homeowners into foreclosure. From this perch, Ms. Warren began a campaign for her bureau. It was no longer a lonely effort. Mr. Frank, a powerful committee chairman, was now an ally. So was an emerging coalition of progressive groups, labor unions and consumer advocates, known as Americans for Financial Reform. Ms. Warren sought out its leader, Heather Booth, for insight into political organizing. “She knew many of the players on the policy side,” Ms. Booth said. “What she hadn’t been experienced with were the politics.” Ms. Warren also built alliances inside government, finding friends in people like Mr. Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett, one of Mr. Obama’s closest advisers. Mr. Axelrod saw the bureau as a political necessity, the one part of financial reform ordinary voters might understand. At times, Ms. Warren’s appeals were strikingly personal: Over dinner in Cambridge, Mass., Ms. Warren told Ms. Jarrett much of the life story that is now familiar to voters who follow her campaign, a tale of deep economic adversity for her family in Oklahoma. “It put in context why this policy was so important to her,” Ms. Jarrett said. Mr. Obama embraced the proposal, putting a consumer bureau in his blueprint for financial reform in the spring of 2009 and talking on late-night television about exploding toasters. Ms. Warren was elated but uneasy. The financial industry was mobilizing, warning that a new regulator would damage the economic recovery. And Ms. Warren was concerned about two of Mr. Obama’s lieutenants: Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, who helmed the National Economic Council. She had profound philosophical disagreements with both men, who believed that her savage criticism of the bank bailouts revealed a misunderstanding of the role of Wall Street in the fragile economic recovery. “Tim and Larry were not fans of this agency,” Ms. Warren said. “I heard more than once from Senate and House staffers that they had proposed scrapping it in return for some other concession that they cared more about.” Of Mr. Obama, she said: “I never worried about the president. I was worried about his advisers.” Mr. Obama remained forcefully supportive and senior officials at the Treasury Department helped negotiate the shape of the bureau at every stage. In the House, Ms. Warren blessed deals struck by Mr. Frank, including one exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from certain new regulatory requirements. The concession was intended to win over an influential trade group, the Independent Community Bankers of America, and its chief lobbyist, Cam Fine. The arrangement dismayed the left — until Ms. Warren endorsed it. “She was very realistic,” Mr. Frank said. “She was deeply engaged in talking to members and she did acquire her own sense of what was politically doable.” Ms. Warren had less influence in the Senate, where Democrats held the majority but their ability to break a filibuster hinged on centrist legislators. So Ms. Warren turned her attention beyond the chamber, rallying activists and talking to the media. In her most provocative move,  she told HuffPost  that the Senate must either create a “strong consumer agency” or have “no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor.” “That,” Ms. Warren said recently, “is the outsider’s game.” The Senate ultimately approved a bureau that was stronger in some ways than Ms. Warren’s 2007 proposal. Instead of a Financial Products Safety Commission, led by committee, it would be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, headed by a single director. And it would draw funding from the Federal Reserve, putting its budget beyond reach of adversaries in Congress. Ms. Warren attended the July 2010 ceremony where Mr. Obama signed the Dodd-Frank bill into law, and with it a consumer bureau that he asked her to help set up. He designated her an aide to himself and to Mr. Geithner, with a mandate to build the regulator she had devised on paper in 2007. There was no promise she would become the permanent director. If Ms. Warren had won a landmark policy victory, it came at the cost of making enemies in Congress and the administration. While Mr. Geithner would criticize business groups for opposing the consumer bureau in a 2014 book, he also cast Ms. Warren as an implacable critic of the bank rescue, more focused on “made-for-YouTube” grandstanding than on crafting practical ideas. He and Mr. Summers described her in White House meetings as unreasonably hostile to financial institutions, and as simply unreasonable. “You cannot play the role she was playing without making people mad at you,” said former Representative Brad Miller, a North Carolina Democrat involved in drafting Dodd-Frank. He said of the Obama economic team, “Those were folks who were used to getting their own way and not having to deal with critics at all.” Mr. Geithner, now president of the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed. Mr. Summers, who has criticized some of Ms. Warren’s 2020 campaign proposals, did not respond to interview requests. But Ms. Warren at times unnerved others in the administration. In a 2015 memoir, Mr. Axelrod wrote that Mr. Obama grew frustrated in 2010 with Ms. Warren’s assertive efforts to position herself to become director — a possibility he feared would enrage banks and doom the Dodd-Frank bill. “Tell her to keep her mouth shut,” Mr. Obama said, according to Mr. Axelrod’s book. “She may well be the choice, but we can’t surface that now.” ‘That Was Her Job’ In the spring of 2011, Mr. Fine, the lobbyist for community banks, got a call from Ms. Jarrett. If the White House selected Ms. Warren to lead the consumer bureau, she asked, would he fight for her confirmation? Mr. Fine said he would. A few days later, Ms. Warren told Mr. Fine over lunch in downtown Washington that the White House had decided against nominating her. “I said: ‘That’s just not right. Do you want me to start a campaign? Do you want me to demand a meeting over at the White House?’” said Mr. Fine, whose offers Ms. Warren declined. “She put on a brave face.” For Ms. Warren, this setback came at the end of a whirlwind year setting up the bureau. Since Dodd-Frank became law, Ms. Warren had traveled widely and hired aggressively. Eager to show her organization was at work, she demanded swift, visible actions, like the creation of a complaint hotline with a public catalog of Americans’ grievances against banks and other lenders. Her recruitment efforts had established the bureau as a political force, as well as a legal one. The staff swelled, and weekly meetings shifted from a modest conference room to an elevator-studded lobby. In a pair of public-relations coups, Ms. Warren asked Holly Petraeus, a Better Business Bureau official married to a renowned general, to lead the Office of Servicemember Affairs, and enlisted Mr. Cordray, the outgoing attorney general of Ohio, to lead her enforcement division.  “As she put it to me: It’s a chance to do on a nationwide basis what you’re doing in Ohio, with more tools, more authority to pursue the banks,” Mr. Cordray said, recalling Ms. Warren’s pitch. It was a chance, in other words, to wield great power. But Ms. Warren would soon learn that hers was borrowed power — power delegated by the president, and for only a year. By the spring of 2011, the opposition to Ms. Warren becoming permanent director was unbending. Republican senators said they would never confirm her; so did Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, a conservative Democrat. Mr. Nelson, who is supporting Mr. Biden in the Democratic primary, said in an interview that he worried about empowering someone he saw as a champion of “runaway government.” “I was very concerned about somebody who had been such a strong advocate for a government bureau that had virtually no control,” Mr. Nelson said. Mr. Reid said Republican opposition sealed Ms. Warren’s fate. “The Republicans stopped her from getting that job,” he said. “That was her job.” Among some of Ms. Warren’s allies, frustration lingers about what happened in 2011. They blame not just Republicans, but also her rivals in the Obama administration and a harsh strain of sexism directed at her by political opponents and the media. “Men never get this adjective, ‘strident.’ That bothers me, because I don’t think she is,” Ms. Petraeus said. “Yes, she’s passionate. She doesn’t hesitate to call somebody out, especially on the Hill, if they’re trying to serve up a bunch of double-dealing nonsense.” Sheila Bair, a Warren ally who was then at the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,  said she had been angry to learn the White House was leaning against nominating Ms. Warren. Her detractors in the administration, Ms. Bair said, had been “whispering behind the scenes that she couldn’t get confirmed.” “Even if that is true, fight it out,” Ms. Bair said. In the end, Mr. Obama concluded Mr. Cordray stood a better chance of clearing the Senate. Republicans would stonewall his nomination until 2013. It was Ms. Jarrett who called to inform Ms. Warren. She also suggested an alternative path forward: running for Senate. “She was not overly enthusiastic in our first call, because she never saw herself as a politician,” Ms. Jarrett said, “and I said I thought that’s the reason she’d be perfect for the job.” Others in the administration, including Mr. Geithner’s aides, saw the Senate race as a way to get Ms. Warren out of the executive branch. Mr. Miller, the former congressman, said he emailed Ms. Warren to warn that her critics might be trying to lure her “into a race that she could not win.” But in September 2011, Ms. Warren entered the race against Senator Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts, starting down a path that has led with improbable speed to a presidential campaign. Her candidacy today resembles a vastly enlarged version of the movement that gave rise to the consumer bureau. In a campaign framed as a crusade of ideas, Ms. Warren has vowed to restructure the economy as president using the same methods that helped make her imagined agency a real structure of concrete and glass. It is not lost on Ms. Warren that, had she become the director, it is unlikely she would be a leading presidential candidate now. “I would have stayed,” she said, “and done it forever.”"
"DES MOINES — Allegations that President Trump courted foreign interference from Ukraine to hurt his leading Democratic rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr., dominated presidential politics on Saturday, as Mr. Biden demanded a House investigation of Mr. Trump’s phone call   with Ukraine’s leader and as Mr. Trump lashed out, denying wrongdoing without releasing a transcript of the call. With Mr. Trump seizing on a familiar defense, saying Democrats were undertaking a “witch hunt” against him, Mr. Biden called on the House of Representatives to begin a new investigation of whether the president sought the interference of a foreign government to bolster his re-election campaign. “This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power,” Mr. Biden said during a campaign swing in Iowa. “We have never seen anything like this from any president.” Mr. Trump is said to have urged the Ukrainian president on a July 25 phone call to investigate Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who did business in Ukraine while his father was vice president. Mr. Trump’s request is part of a secret whistle-blower complaint in the intelligence community that is said to involve Mr. Trump making an unspecified commitment to a foreign leader, according to two people familiar with the complaint. The sharp accusations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden elevated the president’s dealings with Ukraine as a potentially significant new issue in the presidential race, and offered voters a preview of what is likely to be an extraordinary general election contest  if Mr. Biden were to win the nomination.  The controversy has focused on whether Mr. Trump manipulated foreign policy — a military aid package to Ukraine had been delayed at the time of the phone call — to pressure the country’s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to take action to damage Mr. Biden’s election bid. On Saturday, Mr. Trump sought to deflect attention from that question by accusing Mr. Biden of acting improperly as vice president in calling for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had overseen an inquiry into corruption related to the oligarch whose company employed Hunter Biden.  Mr. Trump  described his conversation with Mr. Zelensky as  “perfectly fine and routine. ” “Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He said that any effort to investigate him would fail, comparing it to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into his ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign. Intensifying a line of attack he and his allies have stoked for months, Mr. Trump said the real problem was Mr. Biden and questions about what the president described as “the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son.”  Referring to his conversation with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump said: “Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster.” No evidence  has surfaced to support Mr. Trump’s claim that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor general’s dismissal. But some State Department officials had expressed concern that Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine could complicate his father’s diplomacy there. The issue strikes a particular nerve for Mr. Biden, who has long feared putting his family under the harsh spotlight of a presidential campaign. During a two-minute encounter with reporters on Saturday morning, he grew irate, angrily insisting that he had never spoken with his son about any overseas work. “You should be looking at Trump,” Mr. Biden said. “Trump is doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum.” Even as they avoided mentioning Mr. Biden, other Democratic presidential candidates moved quickly to capitalize on the new dynamic in the race. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who rarely mentions Mr. Trump in her stump speech, opened her remarks at a cattle call on Saturday afternoon by excoriating both the president and congressional Democrats. “He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system,” she told a crowd of 1,200 cheering Democratic voters gathered in Des Moines for an afternoon of primary speeches. “It is time to call out this illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings right now.” Ms. Warren,  who first called for Mr. Trump to be impeached in April  after the release of Mr. Mueller’s report, went further on Friday, arguing on Twitter that by failing to act on impeachment,  Congress had become  “complicit in Trump’s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in U.S. elections.” Though he has yet to call for impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump — as have several of his rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination — Mr. Biden on Saturday tiptoed closer to embracing the  idea, which  has been gaining support on Capitol Hill despite opposition from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Mr. Biden, whose appearances on the campaign trail can be halting and sprinkled with misstatements, has generally delivered his  strongest performances  when focused on Mr. Trump. Speaking about the president allows Mr. Biden to discuss foreign policy and national security, issues that his campaign has said differentiate Mr. Biden, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, from the rest of the 2020 Democratic field. While  Mr. Trump’s attacks give Mr. Biden the one-on-one showdown with the president that his campaign has spent months trying to create, it also exposes him and his son to another round of questions about Hunter Biden’s business activities in Ukraine.  The Biden campaign moved quickly to warn the news media over the story, underscoring a deep concern about how allegations about the younger Mr. Biden’s work will be received by voters. “Any article, segment analysis and commentary that does not demonstrably state at the outset that there is no factual basis for Trump’s claim, and in fact that they are wholly discredited,  is misleading readers and viewers ,” said the deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, in an email to reporters. But Biden advisers also seized on the furor to portray Mr. Trump as fixated on, and worried about, a potential general election race against Mr. Biden.  “There is only one candidate the president is trying to get foreign governments to dig up bogus dirt on,” Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Mr. Biden, said. The   effort by the president and his team to shift the focus to Mr. Biden could boomerang, casting the Democratic front-runner as a sympathetic figure unfairly attacked with foreign help. It could just as easily mark a defining moment for Mr. Biden, a 76-year-old politician first elected to the Senate in 1972 and long accustomed to playing by the more genteel political rules of a different era. [ Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week? ] Donna Brazile, the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman who led the party through Hillary Clinton’s loss to Mr. Trump three years ago, said the exchange on Saturday “in many ways feels like 2016.” Just the prominent discussion of the actions of Mr. Biden and his son in Ukraine, regardless of the merits of the president’s accusations, has the potential to hurt Mr. Biden, Ms. Brazile said. “We’re basically creating a political  story, which right now is undermining Joe Biden , when I do believe the real focus should be getting the substance of the complaint out to the American people as soon as possible,” she said. On Saturday morning, Mr. Trump posted a video mash-up of TV news footage of stories about Mr. Biden’s son. “This is the real and only story,” the president wrote.  Citing the reports by journalists seemed contradictory given the president’s claim that the media had not reported on the issue. But the tweets signaled that Mr. Trump and his campaign organization would be doing as much as possible to sow doubt about Mr. Biden. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a Biden backer, said that no matter who emerges as the Democratic nominee in 2020, that person will face misinformation and slashing personal attacks by the president and his campaign. “You have any other nominee, Trump will do something comparable to try to disadvantage that nominee,” said Mr. Coons, as he walked with Mr. Biden into a Polk County Democratic Party event. “I don’t see anything about this story that is specific to Joe Biden.” So far, Mr. Biden’s rivals, nearly all of whom converged on Iowa this weekend, have been quick to assail Mr. Trump while avoiding commentary about how the president’s accusations against the Bidens would affect the Democratic nominating contest.  Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey , whose campaign manager on Friday released a memo stating he would have to drop out of the race if he failed to raise $1.7 million before the end of September, remarked that “this is not a partisan issue.” He and  former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas  reiterated their calls for Mr. Trump to be impeached. Even if Mr. Biden’s primary competitors don’t take direct aim, the perception of Mr. Biden’s son leveraging his connections cuts a stark contrast with two leading rivals, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders, who have centered their candidacies around a fierce populist message of rooting out corruption in Washington. It’s a message that worked in 2016 for Mr. Trump, who cast Ms. Clinton as the avatar of establishment self-dealing, a past-her-prime creature of Washington unable to adjust to the times and to produce real change. Mr. Biden’s team is acutely aware of that comparison. After Mr. Biden initially gave only a meager retort on the Ukraine issue Friday, his campaign decided to go further. Sensing an opportunity to highlight Mr. Trump’s fixation with Mr. Biden, his campaign released a statement in his name condemning the president for “abhorrent” conduct and demanding Mr. Trump release the transcript of his call with the Ukrainian leader and allow the director of national intelligence to release the whistle-blower’s claims to Congress. Advisers to Mr. Biden said his  initial reluctance  to comment reflected his prudence about discussing sensitive national security matters rather than unease with the work of his son in Ukraine.  But the former vice president is highly sensitive about questions regarding his family, and it was not until several outlets reported on what Mr. Trump said in the phone call last month that the Biden campaign determined it should try to go on the offensive.

"WASHINGTON — Everyone here is keyed up for the Big One. The One that’s going to finally bring Donald Trump down. As soon as the news  broke Wednesday night in The Washington Post  that a whistle-blower had accused the president of making some sort of nefarious “promise” during a call to a foreign leader, the hive erupted. Democrats haven’t been able to get Trump on paying off a porn star to protect his campaign. They haven’t been able to get him on being a Russian agent. They haven’t been able to get him on obstruction of justice. But maybe this time. Maybe this was the One where all would decide that they wanted impeachment, that the president’s behavior was so outrageous that they couldn’t imagine this sleazy business guy sitting in the Oval Office playing a tinpot dictator in a tinfoil hat for another second. Maybe this was the One that would finally move Republicans to turn on the Grendel who is terrorizing the village and gulping down their party. Certainly, Trump himself didn’t think so. As the capital was going into overdrive-freak-out mode Friday night trying to flesh out the whistle-blower story, the president was busy tweeting about a children’s book by a Fox News host: “Buy this Book — great for the kids!” If House Democrats can ever get their paws on the whistle-blower, maybe they can make up for the Judiciary Committee’s performance with Corey Lewandowski this past week, which left many wondering if these hearings designed to pry Trump out of office are just making Democrats look foolish. They certainly provide an ample platform for Trump loyalists to rail against their favorite deep state foils. When failed presidential candidate Eric Swalwell tried to get Lewandowski to read a message Trump had dictated to him, the witness nastily referred to the Democrat as “President Swalwell” and told him to read the message himself. The internecine strains between the impeach-now Nadler crowd and the get-him-out-in-2020 Pelosi crew grew more bitter.  Politico reported  that in a closed-door meeting, Speaker Nancy Pelosi shocked lawmakers and aides by harshly criticizing the House Judiciary Committee staffers for propelling the impeachment effort far beyond where the Democratic caucus stands. “And you can feel free to leak this,” Pelosi said acidly. In an  interview with NPR , she said she hadn’t changed her mind on impeachment, but she does think Congress should pass new laws so future presidents can be indicted. She said everyone had now seen what the founding fathers could not imagine: a president blatantly abusing the Constitution he has sworn to protect. Trump has certainly been working hard to prove Pelosi right that presidents should not ever be above the law. By Friday night, while Trump was readying for a state dinner with his ultraconservative  pal from down under , Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison,   The Wall Street Journal and The Times  were reporting  that the secret whistle-blower complaint involved this: President Trump repeatedly pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine — about eight times,  The Journal said  — to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s loony personal lawyer, to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. Giuliani has been pushing a story about the former vice president and his son, who had ties to a Ukrainian oligarch. After a fair bit of babbling on Chris Cuomo’s CNN show, Giuliani spit out some truth, that he asked the Ukrainians to look into the Bidens. Later  he tweeted : “A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.” Crooked Donald thinks he can create a crooked Joe narrative just like he created a Crooked Hillary one. Which is it, Donald: Crooked or Sleepy? So just consider this: Around the same time that Trump escaped the noose after Robert Mueller’s tepid testimony, sliding away from charges that he colluded with a foreign country to interfere in our election, he began arm-twisting another foreign country to interfere in our election. “Questions have emerged,”  The Times said , “about whether Mr. Trump’s push for an inquiry into the Bidens was behind a weekslong White House hold on military aid for Ukraine. The United States suspended the military aid to Ukraine in early July, according to a former American official.” So the president is under suspicion of making like Nixon and abusing power to go after his enemies, saying it would be a shame if anything happened to that military aid that you want because you don’t dig up some dirt on the son of my political rival. The administration kept the whistle-blower’s complaint from Congress, even though Congress has the legal authority to know what this urgent complaint is about. Pelosi issued an acerbic statement on Friday, noting that Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, was violating the law by refusing to disclose the complaint to Congress. “If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,” she said. Trump is literally acting like an international mobster.  Roy Cohn would be so proud . So is this the Big One? We don’t know because so much has come before. But if it is? Now that would be Big.

"The president defends his conversations with world leaders and blasts Joe Biden's 'disgraceful' statement on Ukraine during an Oval Office meeting with Australian PM Scott Morrison. The developing controversy over a mysterious phone conversation  President Trump  had with a foreign leader apparently centers on Ukraine, as the president and his allies fight back and claim the uproar is just another ""partisan"" plot against him. What touched off the  controversy is a secret  whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM   Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, seemed to acknowledge some effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate potential corruption related to the Biden family, though he gave conflicting answers on the matter in a CNN interview overnight. It remains unclear what the supposed ""promise"" from Trump entailed. The president, however, maintained he said nothing improper, tearing into those pushing the allegations Friday. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, alongside visiting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the president blasted the “ridiculous” story, blaming a “partisan whistleblower” and calling it “just another political hack job.” “I don’t know the identity of the whistleblower,” Trump said. He wouldn’t say what was discussed in the call but said someone should “look into” Biden family connections to Ukraine. He also argued the press has had “a bad week,” insisting he has prevailed in controversies reported by the media. “I guess I’m about 22 and 0, and I’ll keep it that way,” the president said. Afterward, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democratic committee leaders issued a statement demanding the administration hand over the complaint. “President Trump just went on national television—from the Oval Office—and personally attacked an Intelligence Community whistleblower who reported an urgent matter involving serious or flagrant misconduct,"" they said, adding that the ""brazen effort to intimidate this whistleblower risks a chilling effect on future whistleblowers."" Earlier Friday, Trump sounded off on Twitter, accusing Schiff of joining with the media to go after him once again. “The Radical Left Democrats and their Fake News Media partners, headed up again by Little Adam Schiff, and batting Zero for 21 against me, are at it again!” the president tweeted Friday. “They think I may have had a ‘dicey’ conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a ‘highly partisan’ whistleblowers statement.” He added: “Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!” For his part, Schiff told reporters Friday that the whistleblower claim ""deserves a thorough investigation."" ""Come hell or high water that’s what we’re going to do,” he said. Meanwhile, allies of the president took to the airwaves to downplay the story ""This is a clear example of someone from the deep state ... from the intelligence community,"" former  Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said on Fox News’  ""The Story with Martha MacCallum."" ""It was completely overblown. ... It will be a big nothing burger."" Fueling intrigue, Giuliani has raised questions about the activities of former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into that company. During an interview Thursday on CNN, Giuliani was asked whether he had asked Ukraine to look into Biden. Giuliani initially said, ""No, actually I didn't,"" but seconds later he said, ""Of course I did."" He explained that he sought for the government to look into how the case was dismissed. Later, Giuliani tweeted, ""A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job."" MATTHEW WHITAKER CALLS REPORTED WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT A 'CLEAR EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE FROM THE DEEP STATE' The whistleblower complaint has triggered a major showdown with Congress, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would not share details of it with lawmakers. The inspector general for the intelligence community received the complaint and, according to correspondence with Schiff, considered the allegations “credible” and dealing with an “urgent concern.” But the watchdog reported to the committee that his office is “at an impasse” with the director of national intelligence over the disclosure. Inspector General Michael Atkinson wrote that the DNI, “after consulting with the Department of Justice,” determined the complaint does not have to be shared with the intelligence committees under law. He wrote that he will “abide by that determination,” but disagrees with it. After a closed-door hearing Thursday with Atkinson, Schiff voiced concerns about not having access to the information, warning Congress could use legal action or budgetary powers as leverage. ""What’s at stake here goes well beyond this complaint and this president,"" he said. Schiff had subpoenaed Maguire saying he was withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioning whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a letter Tuesday, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of ""urgent concern."" He said the complaint ""concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision."" Schiff said last week that Maguire is required to share the complaint with Congress and said the attempt to hold it back ""raises serious concerns about whether White House, Department of Justice or other executive branch officials are trying to prevent a legitimate whistleblower complaint from reaching its intended recipient, the Congress, in order to cover up serious misconduct."" Following Thursday’s Atkinson hearing, Maguire is still expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. Fox News’ Judson Berger and Hillary Vaughn and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"""We have a Senate that instead of trying to harness the opportunity and potential of every person in this country, they're trying to pull us back,"" Kennedy said Saturday in announcing his run. ""And I'm running for the United States Senate to tear that down, to fight back with everything we've got."" In recent weeks, Kennedy, 38, has sought to draw a generational contrast with Markey, 73, while benefiting from the goodwill shown for the generations of Kennedys who have represented the state before him.  In a campaign email Saturday, Kennedy lists conversations he's had with constituents following President Donald Trump's election and ""outdated structures and old rules"" as reasons he decided to enter the Senate race.  ""This is the fight of our lives, the fight of my generation — and I'm all in,"" he said.  Kennedy is the heir to a political dynasty that has never lost an election in the state, the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy and the son of former Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy II. One great uncle, Ted Kennedy, served in the Senate for nearly 50 years. Another, John F. Kennedy, won his first congressional race in 1946, when Markey was born. Kennedy drew on his family's long ties to Massachusetts in his announcement Saturday. ""It's extremely meaningful to me to be able to do this here, where in 1848 a few steps from where this building is today, my father's family first arrived here in this country,"" he said. Kennedy told reporters on Thursday that Markey is ""a good man,"" but had other issues he wanted to address in the race. Kennedy volunteered for the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic and worked as an assistant district attorney for Massachusetts before his election to Congress in 2012.  Last year, Kennedy gave the Democratic party's official response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, calling for a ""better deal,"" a ""living wage,"" paid leave, affordable child care, ""solvent"" pensions, ""fair"" trade pacts, good roads and a ""health care system that offers mercy, whether you suffer from cancer or depression or addiction."" He also turned his sights on the President. ""Bullies may land a punch,"" he said. ""They might leave a mark. But they have never, not once, in the history of our United States, managed to match the strength and spirit of a people united in defense of their future."" Some viewers focused less on his message and more on his mouth, wondering about his shiny lips. In 2019, Kennedy gave some advice to this year's speaker, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, tweeting to ""misplace your chapstick."" In the past several weeks, as the congressman's interest in the Senate seat became clear, Markey lined up prominent Democratic endorsements. His backers include fellow Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a presidential candidate, and  over 100 state legislators , including House Speaker Robert DeLeo and Senate President Karen Spilka.  ""I endorsed Ed Markey six months ago, seven months ago. I've cut a video for him. Eddie has been a great partner in the Senate,"" Warren told reporters last month, referencing her February decision. ""I think I know why you're asking that and if it's about Joe Kennedy, I will also say Joe Kennedy is also a great partner. He and Lauren were both my students and I worked with Joe before either one of us was in politics and have worked with him ever since he's been in Congress. He's really an amazing person."" US Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democrats' campaign arm and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the firebrand freshman, also back Markey. ""I'm going to run on all the issues I've been fighting for today and into the future: climate change, income inequality, a woman's right to choose and on gun safety legislation,"" said Markey this week. ""I am going to continue those fights into this campaign and I will do so every day that I'm out there crisscrossing the state of Massachusetts and fighting for the people of our state."" Rep. Lori Trahan, Democrat of Massachusetts, has endorsed Markey and said that Kennedy's entry to the race will not change her mind. She told CNN she supports Markey for his leadership on both local and national issues, including his work  addressing pipeline explosions  in her district and his role sponsoring the Green New Deal. She added that even though she's for Markey, ""I think the world of Joe."" Other Massachusetts Democrats are so far keeping out of the race, including Reps. Seth Moulton and Ayanna Pressley, who won their House seats through taking on sitting congressmen in primary campaigns in 2014 and 2018. Moulton told CNN that both Kennedy and Markey are ""great progressive leaders for the state."" In an interview, Pressley said she looked forward to continue working with Markey on environmental and gun control issues, while working with Kennedy on mental health care.  ""I think primaries are healthy,"" Pressley added. When asked about whether he had tried to flip the endorsements of his fellow members of Congress, Kennedy told reporters on Thursday that he respected the decisions that they've made.  ""The race is going to be decided by the people of Massachusetts,"" Kennedy said."
"Giuliani's comments came in a heated exchange on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" as Chris Cuomo pressed the former New York mayor over conversations he'd had  with a Ukrainian official  about Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who had investigated the former vice president's son, Hunter. Giuliani has repeatedly pointed to the event as a scandal, even as other Western governments also called for that prosecutor's dismissal and no evidence has indicated Biden's move was inappropriate. That prosecutor was replaced by Yuriy Lutsenko, who would later drop an investigation into a company in which Hunter Biden was involved. ""Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?"" Cuomo asked Giuliani. ""No, actually I didn't. I asked the Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016 by the Ukrainians for the benefit of Hillary Clinton, for which there is already a court finding,"" Giuliani responded.  ""You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden and his role with the prosecutor?"" Cuomo asked.  ""The only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that Lutsenko, who was appointed, dismissed the case,"" Giuliani said.  ""So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?"" Cuomo pressed. ""Of course I did,"" Giuliani said.  When asked about his contradicting answer, Giuliani said he ""didn't ask"" for Biden to be investigated specifically, but asked Ukraine ""to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme."" Giuliani's remarks come the same day  The Washington Post  and  The New York Times  reported that a recent whistleblower complaint about Trump making a ""promise"" to a foreign leader involves Ukraine.  As CNN previously reported , the complaint has led to a standoff between Congress and acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who has refused to turn over the complaint to the House Intelligence Committee."
"The Steak Fry marks just the latest event in the  first-in-the-nation caucus state  where candidates will pitch themselves as the best contender to take on President Donald Trump.  With less than five months to go until the February 3, 2020, caucuses, candidates are putting an increased focus on the state -- and dusting off some dance moves -- in hopes Iowa voters will bolster their campaigns in a crowded Democratic primary field.  Sen. Kamala Harris of California,  who is looking to reframe her stagnating campaign by setting high expectations in Iowa , made her Steak Fry entrance alongside a marching drumline: Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who captured 2% support in Iowa in a September  CBS/YouGov Iowa poll , put on a similarly energetic display: And while Klobuchar has hit Trump's policies as ""all foam, no beer"" on the campaign trial, she said her beer on Saturday was just the opposite.  ""All beer, no foam,"" she said, beverage in hand.  Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro put less emphasis on his own moves and more focus on the mariachi band that accompanied his entrance.  ""Brought our own flavor to the #SteakFry,"" he tweeted Saturday."
"'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on why President Trump's handling of the latest showdown with Iran is drawing increased media criticism, especially from the likes of John Bolton and neocons. John Bolton had to know he was sending a message to the man who pushed him out of the White House. And a strong message it was, disagreeing with the president on just about every foreign policy hot spot. The recently departed national security adviser was speaking to a Manhattan luncheon for the Gatestone Institute, a conservative think tank he once chaired. About 60 people were gathered at Le Bernadin, including such hotshots as Alan Dershowitz, former attorney general Michael Mukasey and Newsmax chief Chris Ruddy. So the leak, in this case to Politico, was inevitable. The former Fox News contributor certainly gets that any words uttered before such a large audience will soon find their way into print. SIZE MATTERS? MEDIA PRAISE ELIZABETH WARREN -- AND HER CROWDS What’s fascinating here is that the Bolton broadside comes as Trump’s handling of the latest showdown with Iran is drawing increasing media criticism, especially from the right. The president is essentially in a no-win situation, whether he chooses a military strike against Iran or sticks with diplomacy and sanctions. The neocon wing of the GOP wants him to retaliate for the attack on Saudi oil facilities that our intel agencies are blaming on Iran, and is casting his reluctance as a sign of weakness. Bolton told the luncheon that any negotiations were Iran (and North Korea) are “doomed to failure,”  according to Politico. “Bolton also said more than once that Trump’s failure to respond to the Iranian attack on an American drone earlier this summer set the stage for the Islamic Republic’s aggression in recent months…Bolton said the planned response had gone through the full process and everybody in the White House had agreed on the retaliatory strike. But ‘a high authority, at the very last minute,’ without telling anyone, decided not to do it.” Reporters quickly asked Trump for his response. “John was not able to work with anybody, and a lot of people disagreed with his ideas,” he said. “A lot of people were very critical that I brought him on in the first place because of the fact that he was so in favor of going into the Middle East, and he got stuck in quicksand and we became policemen for the Middle East. It’s ridiculous.” SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES The president was referring to the Iraq war and Bolton’s role in the Bush administration. Trump ran against that war, and endless wars, and obviously wants to get out of Afghanistan. The neocons are growing more critical of Trump’s reluctance to pull the trigger in these situations. He even got into a little spat with his pal Lindsey Graham, who said, like Bolton, that the president’s failure to strike back after Iran downed an American drone is what paved the way for the attack that cut Saudi oil production in half. The Beltway press, as part of an establishment whose kids are rarely sent off to fight, often reflects these pro-war instincts. Iraq, you’ll recall, was going to be a cakewalk. Bret Stephens, a conservative  New York Times  columnist who detests the president, wrote yesterday that Trump’s policy is “locked, half-cocked, and probably bluffing.” He said this president combines “the rhetorical impulses of Bob Dornan with the strategic instincts of Dennis Kucinich.” Trump does like to talk tough with foreign adversaries. And obviously he has ordered airstrikes before. But it’s no accident that he threatened to incinerate North Korea and wound up in a pen pal relationship with Kim Jong-un. And yet if he keeps turning to sanctions and diplomacy, does there come a point where he looks like Barack Obama and his Syrian red line? Trump is bound to disappoint the neocons by exercising restraint when it comes to military options, knowing full well that there are unintended consequences that could bog down U.S. troops for years to come. That means he’s likely to face continued criticism from John Bolton, but might be in tune with the war-weary portion of the country."
"Sen. Cory Booker's staff has been put on notice that he has until the end of September 2019 to raise $2 million or he will be dropping out of the race; former DNC Chair Donna Brazile reacts. Sen. Cory Booker’s  presidential campaign manager is warning in a memo to staff that the  Democratic senator from New Jersey  must raise an additional $1.7 million by the end of the third quarter of fundraising – just 10 days away – or the campaign will not have a “legitimate long-term path forward.” In the memo , campaign manager Addisu Demissie warned that following a weaker than expected cash haul during the early part of September, “the next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race."" BOOKER VOICES CONCERNS OVER BIDEN'S ABILITY 'TO CARRY THE BALL' The existence of the memo was first reported Saturday morning by NBC News, with Fox News confirming the news with multiple sources. Two sources, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said it was no accident that the memo was leaked, and described it as an effort to spark a surge in fundraising over the next 10 days.  And a campaign memo sent to political reporters Saturday morning said: “This isn't an end-of-quarter stunt or another one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press. This is a real, unvarnished look under the hood of our operation at a level of transparency unprecedented in modern presidential campaigns.” Booker, who declared his candidacy for the White House in early February, quickly built a formidable operation in the early voting primary and caucus states. The large staff on the ground in Iowa, New Hampshire, and other early voting states is expensive to maintain. Demissie warned that while the campaign can continue at its current size and strength,  it needs more funding if it wants to expand. WHERE BOOKER STANDS IN THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2020 POLL Demissie explained in his memo ""If our campaign is not in a financial position to grow, he’s not going to continue to consume resources and attention that can be used to focus on beating Donald Trump, which needs to be everyone's first priority.” While Booker qualified for the third and fourth round Democratic presidential primary debates, he’s struggled in polling, averaging in the low to mid-single digits,  far behind top-tier contenders former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens.

"Now Ukraine has become wrapped in the Trump presidency's many subplots: the role of Russia and President Vladimir Putin, the legacy of Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, Trump's reelection outlook and a loose network of advisers not always operating in concert. The result is renewed focus on a country Trump once sought to tune out but where he now sees a political opportunity. His approach to Ukraine melds political and national security concerns fanned by some of his closest advisers. Trump has raised the issue involving the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden repeatedly in private conversations and believes there is a political opportunity in further probing the matter, the people familiar with the matter said. He's been urged along by his private attorney,  Rudy Giuliani, who told CNN on Thursday evening  that he'd pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son. Giuliani has maintained that he has been acting on his own and not at the direction of the President as he meets with Ukrainian officials. But Giuliani is aware that the issue has gotten Trump's attention, according to the people familiar with the situation. And Trump has raised it multiple times, in person and on the phone.  A source close to the White House who is familiar with Trump's comments said the President has been seething for months about Ukraine and Biden. The source described Trump as ""angry"" about what he sees as a liability for the former vice president. The source also said Giuliani has been ""egging him on."" Trump told reporters on Friday that ""somebody ought to look into"" the Biden matter, and said that ""it doesn't matter what I discussed"" during a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. CNN reported on Friday that in that call,  Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden's son . Trump is due to meet next Wednesday with Zelensky in New York. Trump was not initially interested in meeting with Zelensky or engaging with him, viewing him as an extension of the country's previous leader, President Petro Poroshenko. Trump believed Ukraine was a corrupt country that wasn't committed to reform, according to people familiar with his thinking at the time. The phone call and meeting come after months of back and forth between Trump and his advisers, who have worked to convince him that engaging the new Ukrainian leader is worth his time and effort for national security reasons. The country's attacks on Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, with accusations of him laundering money with offshore accounts, were the ultimate foundation for the President's beliefs.  Trump also consistently cast Ukraine -- a portion of which was annexed by Russia in 2014 -- as a messy situation created by his predecessor that he was unenthusiastic about wading into himself. ""He had never been concerned or interested in Ukraine,"" one person familiar with Trump's thinking said.  ""Obama lost it,"" was Trump's view, the person said, adding that the President always seemed ""more interested in engaging Putin than Zelensky.""  Trump's ties to Putin have been heavily scrutinized, and he's been accused of showing deference to the Russian leader. He's also remained fixated on Obama, frequently seeking to unravel his legacy. That lack of interest in Ukraine appeared to shift over the summer, when some of Trump's national security advisers worked to convince him that engaging Ukraine's new leader would benefit US national security interests. Though Trump continued to remain skeptical, he told his advisers he was open to being convinced of further engagement.  Then-national security adviser John Bolton and other senior Trump administration officials invited Oleksandr Danylyuk, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, to Washington for meetings in early July. They went well, and the White House saw it as a ""sign of encouragement"" to nudge Trump toward working with Ukraine.  The renewed engagement happened to dovetail with Giuliani's efforts to convince Ukrainian officials to look into Biden and his son -- an effort Giuliani spoke about publicly and that quickly caught Trump's attention. Even before Zelensky took office, Giuliani made known he was looking to set up a meeting to discuss an investigation into Burisma, the natural gas company where Biden's son Hunter had served on the board of directors. Giuliani's meetings occurred over the summer, just as US administration officials were working to spark Trump's interest in Ukraine. The parallel efforts seemed to be the launchpad for convincing Trump to engage with Ukraine more robustly. Three weeks later, Trump spoke by phone with Zelensky for the first time, in a call that is now under intense scrutiny for its potential role in the  whistleblower's complaint . Later, aides worked to arrange a meeting in Poland, though Trump ultimately did not make the trip because of a hurricane in the United States. People familiar with the matter said Bolton and the other US officials who met with Danylyuk in early July did not discuss the Biden matter. But the issue was known, and colored the talks. ""That was a bizarre situation, but it all seemed to be dealt with in Giuliani track,"" a person familiar with the meetings said. ""It was out there, but it was being handled by Giuliani. We did not deal with that because he [Giuliani] was talking about it and saying he was a private citizen."" At the same time, the administration begin reviewing $250 million in foreign aid to Ukraine, initially placing a hold on the package that angered some in Congress. The issue provided another wedge between Bolton, who was an advocate for the aid, and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who pushed for the package to be reviewed.  The money was released last week . It's not known how, if at all, the foreign aid was related to the Biden matter. And a person familiar with the situation said Friday that Trump had not discussed the pending aid package during the July 25 call with Zelensky. But even before this week's revelations about the intelligence whistleblower, Democrats in Congress had accused the administration of engaging in a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government. Through it all, Trump's interactions and meetings on Ukraine have been treated with special sensitivity within the administration. The State Department never got extensive readouts of his calls. And few people within the administration learned precisely what was discussed. ""There was concern about leaks,"" one person said of the tight hold on information."
"As with so much in the Trump presidency, it all starts with Hillary Clinton. Here's what we know: Giuliani's accusation Rudy Giuliani, the President's attorney and political attack dog, said on CNN Thursday night that his ongoing efforts to  pursue Clinton took him to Ukraine . First he alleged, without evidence, that she and Democrats were behind the effort to discredit Paul Manafort, who is currently in prison for, among other things, laundering money he was paid as a political consultant in Ukraine. Then things turned away from Clinton. ""In the course of investigating that, I found out this incredible story about Joe Biden, that he bribed the President of the Ukraine in order to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,"" said Giuliani, alleging a media coverup. ""That is an astounding scandal of major proportions, which all of you have covered up for five or six months."" From there the interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo went completely off the rails and Giuliani eventually admitted he had asked the current Ukrainian government to look into Biden. ""Of course I did!"" he said. But the President's attorney trying to get action from Ukraine is one thing. It would be something different entirely if the administration used official leverage to get a foreign country to investigate a US political rival, especially just months after special counsel Robert Mueller detailed multiple interactions between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia but found nothing rising to the level of coordination between campaign associates and officials and Russian governmental officials. Trump spoke with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 and that phone call may be part of what led to the complaint against Trump. Asked Friday about that July 25 call and whether he mentioned Biden to the Ukrainian President,  Trump tried to deflect back to Biden . ""It doesn't matter what I discuss,"" he said. ""But I will say this: Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case."" On Friday afternoon, the Wall Street Journal reported that on that phone call Trump pressured the new president ""about eight times"" to work with Giuliani on Biden, citing people familiar with the matter. Vice President Mike Pence recently met with Zelensky and was asked about Giuliani's efforts and whether the administration has held up aid to Ukraine as a result. REPORTER: Specifically, number one, did you discuss Joe Biden at all during that meeting yesterday with the Ukrainian President?  And number two, can you assure Ukraine that the hold-up of that money has absolutely nothing to do with efforts, including by Rudy Giuliani, to try to dig up dirt on the Biden family? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE:  Well, on the first question, the answer is no.  But we — with President Zelensky yesterday, we discussed — we discussed America's support for Ukraine and the upcoming decision the President will make on the latest tranche of financial support in great detail. Ukraine uses the aid in its efforts against Russian separatists, part of a long-term conflict with Russia. Biden's efforts in Ukraine Despite Giuliani's allegation, there has been no media coverup of the allegations against Biden.  The New York Times wrote about Biden's son  and his activities back in May and made clear that Trump's allies were pushing it. The President tweeted about it at the time. Since then, Trump, Giuliani and others have come back to the story repeatedly. Asked about Trump's statement Friday, Biden said ""Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion."" ""Not one single one, and so I have no comment except the President should start to be (the) President,"" Biden said. The crux of Giuliani's allegation is that Joe Biden tried to have Ukraine's top prosecutor ousted in 2016 because of an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. At the time, Hunter Biden was serving on Burisma's board. But the reality is much more nuanced. It is absolutely true that at the same time Burisma was being investigated, western governments, including the Obama administration wanted the prosecutor removed due to concerns about corruption in his own office. Biden too opposed  the prosecutor in Ukraine, Viktor Shokin, and threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine. He's actually bragged about it. Recounting a trip he made to Kiev in 2016, he said it showed the US was able to get Ukraine to take corruption more seriously. ""I looked at them and said: I'm leaving in six hours,"" Biden  said during an event at the Council of Foreign Relations in 2018 . ""If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" None of this is a particularly good look for the Bidens, but there's no proof or suggestion of any actual wrongdoing. At least one former official in the prosecutor's office said the investigation into Burisma had already been shelved by the time Joe Biden was threatening to withhold financial aid unless Ukraine replaced its top prosecutor. It's also not clear if Hunter Biden was a focus of that investigation when it was occurring. In an interview on May 14 posted on Facebook by his assistant, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yury Lutsenko said Burisma paid an entity connected to Hunter Biden ""millions,"" but added, ""from my point of view, a board member can be paid whatever a company decides ... they didn't violate any Ukrainian laws.""  He said that he said it was a matter for US law to consider, not Ukrainian investigators. Lutsenko in May said he was looking to ""reanimate"" an investigation of Burisma, Hunter Biden's former employer -- but that apparently never happened. Lutsenko left office in August after the new administration of Zelensky took office. Giuliani himself went to meet with a representative of Zelensky after the President's call with Trump in July. According to Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Ukrainian officials understand there is a link between what Giuliani was asking of the Ukrainians to do and getting US military aid. Murphy met with the Ukrainian President a few weeks ago and described the scene on Twitter. ""Zelensky did not explicitly connect the two in our meeting, but he was VERY concerned about the cut off of aid, and VERY aware of the conversations that Rudy Giuliani was having with his team. I told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump's campaign operatives. He agreed,"" Murphy explained in a series of tweets.   Trump's playbook Fostering conspiracy theories about his rival was a strategy that worked for Trump in 2016 as he used decades of conservative conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton to label her ""crooked"" and suggest she should be in jail rather than the White House. Biden, however, is not followed by the same political taint as the Clintons and the effort by Trump and his allies may now have led to a whistleblower sounding the alarm under a law meant to protect intelligence officials for uncovering improper activity. The specifics of the whistleblower complaint remain a mystery and could remain that way as Trump's new acting Director of National Intelligence refuses to share information about the complaint with Congress. The Intelligence Community Inspector General has caused alarm by publicly saying he is being kept from doing his job. Father and son Hunter Biden's personal life and substance abuse issues have already caused angst for the former vice president. The overlap between the father and son's political and business interests have fueled GOP attacks that Biden is little more than a self-interested politician. Whether the facts fully support that case appears to be an afterthought for his critics. GOP researchers have been digging through Hunter Biden's career history as well as the points where it appears to intersect with his father's, particularly where it pertains to Ukraine and China, another topic Giuliani brought up during his interview with Cuomo."
"The affair, centering on Trump's contacts with a leader of a mystery foreign nation -- identified in two reports as Ukraine -- has also injected a toxic element into relations among the President, the intelligence community and Congress. It is hard to see how any of this ends well. Six months after special counsel Robert Mueller shut up shop, the White House again faces suspicion over Trump's dealings with a foreign power and seems to be taking steps to stop the full story from coming out. Democrats are rummaging for new skeletons in Trump's closet and yet another showdown is developing between the executive and Congress that appears almost certain to play out in the courts. The details of the controversy unleashed  when a whistleblower sounded the alarm  about the President are complex, disputed according to political allegiance and largely not public. The Washington Post  and  The New York Times  reported Thursday that the contacts at issue between Trump and the foreign leader involve Ukraine. In the past, some of Trump's supporters, including his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, have urged the Kiev government to open investigations that the President could use to raise suspicions about his political rivals, including Joe Biden. In a  heated exchange with CNN's Chris Cuomo  on Thursday night, Giuliani denied asking Ukraine to investigate the former vice president, before admitting he had done just that. The US and Ukraine were in discussions about $250 million in military aid to Kiev this summer that had been delayed by the White House. Giuliani said he didn't know anything about the package, but that if Trump had used it as leverage to benefit himself politically in any way he would not have done anything wrong.  ""The reality is that the President of the United States, whoever he is, has every right to tell the president of another country you better straighten out the corruption in your country if you want me to give you a lot of money. If you're so damn corrupt that you can't investigate allegations -- our money is going to get squandered,"" Giuliani said.  T rump attempted to discredit the whistleblower as ""highly partisan"" in a series of tweets Friday morning, echoing remarks made by Giuliani on Thursday night. The President said his comments to ""a certain foreign leader"" were ""pitch perfect."" Trump tweeted: ""Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!"" Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. There is so far no public evidence that the whistleblower's complaint pertains to this conversation or that there was any abuse of power by Trump. The White House later lifted the hold on aid.  But the potential ramifications of this new storm are already becoming clear and the risks facing the President, the intelligence community and Democrats in Congress are climbing by the day. Disturbing possibilities There must at least be a possibility that Trump abused his power or committed a grievous ethical lapse in dealing with the foreign leader. His defense was not exactly reassuring, considering some of the wild comments the President has made in the company of rogue counterparts such as Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un. ""Is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call?"" Trump tweeted on Thursday. CNN reported Thursday  that the intelligence community inspector general suggested to the House Intelligence Committee that the complaint raised concerns about multiple actions. He would not say whether those instances involved   Trump, sources familiar with the closed-door briefing told CNN. The inspector general, Michael Atkinson, was legally unable to discuss the complaint itself, since Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has declined to hand it over. Democrats say he is compelled to provide the complaint under whistleblower legislation, and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said his committee may take legal action if it isn't turned over. The Washington Post on Wednesday  said the complaint referenced a ""promise"" Trump allegedly made to the unidentified leader. CNN has not confirmed that aspect of the controversy. The whistleblower didn't have direct knowledge of the communications, an official briefed on the matter told CNN. Instead, the whistleblower's concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration's determination that the complaint didn't fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said. It is hard to know the potential exposure faced by the President. But given the sensitivity of the issue, the complaint is likely to have come from an official familiar with the scope of presidential power. And it was signed off as ""urgent and credible"" by the inspector general -- a Trump appointee -- who thought Congress should know in line with whistleblowing laws. The implication of such a fact pattern is staggering and opens up the potential of serious misconduct inside the White House -- despite Trump's denials of any wrongdoing. A President maligned?  If, on the other hand, the alleged behavior by the President does not reach such a bar, the political fallout will be considerable. Trump, acting within his wide Article Two constitutional powers, may have been maligned and there will be accusations that the whistleblower -- though moving within the scope of the law -- will have overreached. The President's suspicion of the intelligence community, which he sees as a ""Deep State"" bent on overthrowing him, will grow. If a president cannot trust his own spies, and thinks they are working against him and not the country's enemies, then America's national security will be harmed. The President's allies are already arguing that the controversy is simply another ruse by House Democrats to damage Trump. ""He has very wide authority, really unchecked authority, to talk to world leaders about anything he deems appropriate as he is representing the United States of America,"" said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union.""If this were able to go forward, any staffer in an agency could constantly hobble a Democratic President, duly elected."" ""This is an unconstitutional argument,"" Schlapp said on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Of course, the White House could clear all this up by explaining the contents of the alleged contacts between the President and the foreign leader. But it is taking the opposite tack. According to three CNN sources , the White House and the Justice Department advised the director of national intelligence that the complaint isn't governed by laws covering intelligence whistleblowers. The revelation is the first known evidence of the White House's involvement in the standoff. There may be an argument that the content of the President's communications or an official's impressions of them sent to Congress are subject to executive privilege. But the administration's resistance to scrutiny is already fueling suspicions of a cover-up. And it throws new light on the role of Attorney General William Barr -- who has been accused by critics of shaping special counsel Robert Mueller's damning revelations to the President's advantage. Barr, who served in the same role for President George H.W. Bush, advocates a theory of expansive presidential power, one reason why he has become perhaps Trump's favorite Cabinet member. Whistleblowers exposed House Democrats argue that the White House is yet again adopting a model of presidential power that threatens to tear the checks and balances of the US system to shreds. Schiff effectively argued that the approach taken by the administration could lead to the quashing of whistleblower claims in the government. That could lead down a road of power without accountability and in theory impunity for any presidential wrongdoing. ""The impact of this opinion is that if the Department of Justice decides that any employee of the intelligence committee comes forward, follows the law, follows the process, is nonetheless outside the process, they're not protected,"" the California Democrat said. ""Which not only means this whistleblower is not protected, it means no whistleblower is protected. That is the danger of the DOJ's misinterpretation of the law."" The fresh confrontation between the White House and the Congress is certain to fuel the frustration of Democrats at the White House's efforts to evade scrutiny. And it will add momentum to claims of many grass roots liberals and a growing corps of House Democrats who do not share House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reluctance to proceed with impeachment."
"True to form the President and his confederates are only adding to the chaos. In response to questioning from CNN's Chis Cuomo Thursday night, for example, Trump's personal lawyer and TV attack dog,  Rudolph Giuliani, both denied and confirmed  that the controversy may have to do with the fact that Giuliani has urged Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden is leading the pack of Democrats hoping to oppose Trump in 2020. Could it be that the President's lawyer is mixing politics and policy in an unsavory way?   As usual it's hard to follow the action, but what is known thus far should worry us all. According to various news outlets, the White House and Justice Department told the inspector general for intelligence matters there was nothing to the whistleblower's report that a high level official, most likely the President, communicated in some untoward way with a foreign leader. Under apparent pressure from the White House and Justice, the acting director of national intelligence blocked the intelligence IG from notifying Congress of the complaint, sidestepping a law requiring this. Now Capitol Hill leaders and the administration are battling over  just who has a right  to see the complaint. In a normal, pre-Trump Washington, the issue of such a complaint would have been handled in a routine, if not collegial, way. But in this era, when the White House stonewalls as a matter of course, such a conflict seems inevitable—and, too, that the President would act in a way so heedless that some intelligence professional would sound an alarm But this new crisis is completely in character for Trump, who has always operated as if personal relationships, and his self-interest, are all that really matter in every context. In every organization he has ever led, from his businesses in New York to the US government he has insisted on being the sole authority and expert, a man who ignored the rules as a matter of routine. During his decades as a real estate developer and entertainer,  Trump's style meant that he controlled  all of the many hundreds of entities under his organization's umbrella, and those who worked below him were charged with making sure his decisions -- whether good or bad -- turn out for the best, while he claimed credit for successes and dodged accountability for failures.  Then, and apparently now, Trump relied on his instinct, which often got him into big trouble. Multiple bankruptcies proved that Trump's decision-making gut is a less-than-perfect instrument. Upon examining his failures,  Susan Craig, of The New York Times, declared,  ""We found most of it was just bad business.""  As President, Trump has depended on unconventional operatives like Giuliani to help him in an unofficial capacity. For months Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, has been trying to stir up concerns about Biden and his son Hunter's involvement with a Ukrainian energy firm. An official in that country  told The Daily Beast  that Trump is seeking compromising information. Trump himself  has said ""it doesn't matter""  if the President of the United States is engaged in this slimy business. In comments to reporters Friday,  he added:  ""I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate.""    Hope for real clarity on the matter is dimmed by the fact that Trump enjoys rubber-stamp support from the Republican-controlled Senate, which has approved nearly all of his nominees for federal positions only to see  a record number leave their posts in short order.  Most recently Trump was forced to withdraw his nominee for the top job at the Federal Emergency Management Agency amid an FBI investigation. FEMA is part of the  Department of Homeland Security, where ""acting"" officials are found in striking numbers  at the top of the organizational chart.  ""Actings"" are running things across the administration. In fact, the director of national intelligence caught up in the latest mess, Joseph Maguire, is on temporary assignment and, therefore, lacking the gravitas of an appointee who really owns the job. Although officials who lack permanent status surely suffer for it, their insecurity seems to suit Trump's seat-of-the-pants style.  He has said he prefers provisional appointees  because they are more readily moved in and out of positions. They might also be assumed to be more vulnerable to whatever pressure the White House applied.  The downside, of course, is that ""acting"" leaders may struggle to get anything done or to win the respect of their troops. (Imagine, for example, an army going into battle under a general whose stars were applied with Velcro and whose orders are under constant presidential review.)      Indeed, Trump has spent his life making sure that those who serve him feel like they are never quite secure, while at the same time he has sought to make himself immune to examination. As President,  he has long banned note-takers  from some talks with foreign leaders and then limited White House reporting on his phone calls with them.  The current whistleblower controversy appears to be yet another case of Trump seeking ways to avoid accountability. The  Washington Post reported  that White House records indicate that that Trump had had ""conversations or interactions with at least five foreign leaders in the preceding five weeks"": Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani.  CNN reported Thursday that the White House and the Justice Department told the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that the nature of the whistleblower complaint isn't covered by laws governing intelligence whistleblowers.   According to CNN : ""Previously the White House has cited longstanding precedent in refusing congressional requests for documents related to Trump's meetings with his Russian counterpart. 'It is settled law that the Constitution entrusts the conduct of foreign relations exclusively to the Executive Branch, as it makes the President 'the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations,'  White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote in a letter to Democrats in May."" The President defends his secretive dealings with foreign leaders by insisting that America's international success depends on his personal rapport with them. He says he has great relationships with the likes of Putin, North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un, China' President Xi and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.   Russia, China, North Korea and Saudi Arabia have all caused trouble to America during the Trump era, and his brand of personal politics hasn't seemed to help any. Instead, it has reinforced the suspicions that many held toward Trump when he was just a self-promoting businessman. Back then, of course, his business was his business. Today, he acts on behalf of the American people. Earning their trust requires that he follow the rules.     "

"To the Editor: Re  “ Claim on Trump Is Said to Involve a Foreign Leader ” (front page, Sept. 20): Donald Trump has said, “ I have the right  to do whatever I want as president.” Indeed this is mostly true. The president not only has broad powers but he can even be spared legal consequences as long as he remains in office. This was made painfully clear in the Mueller investigation. There are, however, red lines. The founding fathers did allow for congressional oversight and action in the event of a bad actor who would use the office of the presidency in service of himself rather than in service of the country. Now there is a whistle-blower in the intelligence community who has urgent information about the president that he believes Congress needs to know. It is information that Mr. Trump and the Justice Department would rather see withheld from Congress. If speculations are true, and the president himself or through an emissary threatened to withhold vital military aid to Ukraine if it did not investigate business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden’s son or pursue a corruption investigation of Mr. Biden himself, that type of quid pro quo would be deeply troubling. It is the definition of politically self-serving. Lawlessness is rampant in the Trump administration. If we want to restore the rule of law to our republic and faith in our democracy, we must insist that the whistle-blower be permitted to speak, come what may.  Felicia Massarsky Atlantic City To the Editor: The  legacy of President Trump will be a field of horrors stretching to the horizon, but interrupted by a few bits of important insight into the flaws in our democracy. Who would have thought a president would refuse to disclose his potentially conflicting business interests, then use his powers to enhance those very interests? Who would have thought that the nation’s chief executive would dispatch a lackey to threaten his duly appointed attorney general with professional execution if he didn’t reverse a principled decision? Who would have thought that in service of his re-election, the leader of the nation might have tried to enlist a foreign power to conduct an investigation of his likely political opponent? Yes, one day we’ll look back on these times with disgust, but it will be seasoned with a pinch of sardonic gratitude to the man who showed us where we might find the cracks in what we thought was the seamless wall of our democracy.

"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Former Vice President  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  found himself fending off new questions about his decades-long record on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, in a testy exchange with a moderator who described his treatment of her as “condescending.”  During a Friday night forum focused on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, Mr. Biden seemed to recoil from the direct questioning from Lyz Lenz, a Cedar Rapids Gazette columnist.  In a question-and-answer session, Ms. Lenz repeatedly pressed Mr. Biden about his past votes for the Defense of Marriage Act, the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy that forbade openly gay people from serving and his statement earlier this year that Vice President Mike Pence, known for his socially conservative positions, was “a decent guy.” Mr. Biden sought to defend himself, reminding the audience in a steamy auditorium that he supported same-sex marriage before President Obama. “I didn’t have to evolve,” he said.  Then, before an audience of 700 volunteers, activists and voters, he called Ms. Lenz “a lovely person,” prompting her to reply, “just asking the questions people want to know.  Offstage after their exchange, she wrote on Twitter that Mr. Biden called her “a real sweetheart.” “I interpreted it as a little condescending,” Ms. Lenz said in a backstage interview, echoing the immediate criticism of some prominent feminists on social media.  Supporters of Mr. Biden said Ms. Lenz’s questions included a series of inaccuracies. His supporters said he didn’t back “don’t ask, don’t tell” and voted for an amendment to remove the measure from a broader bill in 1993. They also argue that she misrepresented the impact of the 1994 crime bill that he championed.  Mr. Biden had already responded to criticism of his comments about Mr. Pence earlier this year,  writing on Twitter  shortly after his initial remark that “there is nothing decent about being anti-L.G.B.T.Q. rights, and that includes the vice president.”  The forum, hosted by advocacy group Glaad, marked the first extended public discussion of L.G.B.T.Q issues in the 2020 Democratic primary race, which went largely unmentioned in the Democratic debates so far despite the group representing a loyal bloc within the Democratic Party. The focus on candidates’ past departures from contemporary progressive politics stemmed in large part from the lack of daylight between most of the major candidates on issues of L.G.B.T.Q. equality: nearly all back banning  conversion therapy  for minors; rolling back the spread of rules that allow religious businesses to decline serving L.G.B.T.Q. customers; and ending the Trump administration transgender military ban. Most have promised to pass the Equality Act, legislation opposed by the White House that would bolster the list of protected classes under civil rights law to include discrimination based on “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” “It’s about time we had a woke president on these issues,” Senator Cory Booker said, “so we see everyone for the equal dignity and equal citizenship we all have.” The candidates boasted about their accomplishments — large and small — on behalf of L.G.B.T.Q Americans. Mr. Booker noted that as mayor of Newark, he had vowed not to officiate any weddings until everyone had the right to wed. Senator Elizabeth Warren opened her appearance by reading the names of 18 trans women of color who have been killed this year. Mr. Biden said he has been sympathetic to same-sex couples since he was a boy, when, he said, he and his father witnessed two men kissing while disembarking from the train station in Wilmington, Del.  “He said, ‘Joey, it’s simple,’” Mr. Biden said. “They love each other.” In a historically diverse field, the L.G.B.T.Q. community has celebrated their own record-breaking first: Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.,  the first openly gay man  to mount a major campaign for president. Though Mr. Buttigieg has collected significant financial support from leaders in the gay community, some have begun to question his commitment to their causes. While Mr. Buttigieg frequently references his husband, Chasten, at campaign events and  told his coming out story on the debate stage  last week as an example of resiliency, he hasn’t placed L.G.B.T.Q. equality at the center of his campaign. He faced questions about a ban on gay men donating blood, pointing out that as mayor he couldn’t participate in a blood drive sponsored by his office.  “It’s an example, one of many examples, of the exclusions in this country,” he said. “We are still living with the long tail of prejudices.”  Other candidates also came with long records to tout. Mr. Biden, a reliable L.G.B.T.Q. ally, frequently points to his early support of gay marriage, noting his decision to break with the Obama administration and publicly endorse the policy in 2012. Mr. Obama followed a few days later. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii faced questions about  her history of anti-gay stances , including decrying “homosexual extremists” when her home state debated whether to legalize civil unions more than a decade ago. Ms. Gabbard has apologized for her past statements and said she no longer holds those views. “My record speaks for itself,” she said, citing her history of serving with L.G.B.T.Q people in the military and congressional record of supporting equality measures.  About 5 percent of voters in the four early Democratic primary states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — identify as L.G.B.T.Q., according to data collected by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s  largest L.G.B.T.Q. rights organization . Another 23 percent prioritize L.G.B.T.Q.-inclusive policies when voting, according to the group. The event is the first of two forums hosted by L.G.B.T.Q. organizations to question the candidates on their views. A second event, hosted by Human Rights Campaign in Los Angeles, will be broadcast on CNN next month."
"John Yoo and Buck Sexton react. President Trump  nominated a slew of judges Friday to posts on California-based federal courts, ramping up efforts to reshape the judiciary after hitting a milestone earlier this month with the confirmation of the 150th federal judge on his watch. Two nominations are for the influential San Francisco-based  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , a long-liberal bench with jurisdiction across the American West whose political makeup has shifted with Trump’s aggressive appointment campaign. TRUMP TAKES ON CALIFORNIA OVER FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS Among the nominees is Patrick Bumatay, a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of California whom Trump nominated last year for the same job. But objections from California Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, over his lack of judicial experience and other issues, derailed the nomination. Trump later nominated Bumatay, who is openly gay, to a district court seat but his name resurfaced over the summer for a possible comeback bid for the Ninth Circuit amid a new vacancy.  While it is traditional for a nominee's home-state senators to give their approval, it is not required, and Trump lately has  bypassed the so-called “blue slip” tradition  in order to get conservative judges on the bench. While Democrats have fumed at the tactics, conservatives cheered Trump this month for seeing the 150th federal judge confirmed. “This is a historic milestone,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a statement. “As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will continue to push through highly qualified, conservative judges at all levels of the federal courts.” Graham and his Republican allies on the committee are likely to be receptive to Trump’s latest picks. Trump also nominated Lawrence VanDyke, a Justice Department official and former Nevada solicitor general, for the Ninth Circuit. Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, praised his record fighting “the overreach by the Obama Administration and its job-killing EPA.” Trump on Friday announced four other nominees for California District Court posts. But the Ninth Circuit has been a focal point given the sprawling territory it covers and its record in decades past of liberal-leaning rulings. Under Trump, the court has shifted more moderate with the addition of seven Trump-appointed judges. Nearly half of the 29 seats are now occupied by GOP-appointed judges. Last year, that number stood at six. NINTH CIRCUIT HANDS TRUMP WIN ON ASYLUM POLICY Earlier this month, the court handed Trump a win as it lifted a nationwide injunction on his controversial asylum policy, ruling that for now the injunction should only apply to states within the circuit. Trump also scored a victory from a California district court on Thursday when a Bush-appointed judge granted a request to block, for now, a law requiring presidential candidates to release tax returns in order to run in the state primaries. Democrats, though, have accused the Trump administration, along with GOP allies in the Senate, of destroying congressional custom by moving past consultations with home-state senators. Feinstein, in a floor speech over the summer about another Ninth Circuit nomination, said, “This disregard of blue slips represents another breakdown of Senate traditions.” She said screening candidates for lifetime appointments to ensure they’re qualified is a “critical” task and warned Republicans: “What goes round, comes around.” The latest nominations also come amid new legal battles between the Trump administration and California. Early Friday afternoon, 23 states banded together to sue the administration in a bid to stop its plan to revoke California’s authority to set strict fuel economy standards. That suit was filed in a D.C. federal court and does not fall in the Ninth Court, but California Attorney General Xavier Becerra touted prior rulings in his state that upheld California’s standards.

"The media mob and their handlers in the Democratic Party are so desperate to smear the Trump administration that pretty much anything goes. Sean Hannity  thanked the ""media mob"" Friday, saying they've ""opened the door for a national discussion"" on former Vice President  Joe Biden 's alleged pressuring of Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to his son Hunter. ""Multiple reports now suggest that the so-called whistleblowers claim it surrounds the country of Ukraine,"" the Fox News host said on ""Hannity."" ""Now they're doing us a favor because they're now opening up a lot of questions we wanted to a cover for a long time. ""The boomerang comes right back on Biden, his family and the Democrats."" ""The boomerang comes right back on Biden, his family and the Democrats."" CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, President Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was  eventually released  after objections from the Senate. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. Biden said Friday that the claim has no credibility. Biden released a statement Friday criticizing Trump for the alleged phone call, demanding the president release a transcript and the whistleblower's complaint. WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM ""This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,"" the statement read. Hannity blasted the media for ignoring Biden's possible corruption. ""I didn't see anyone in the mob interested in that story but I do think the media mob, you have opened the door now for a national discussion about, well, what did Biden and his son do -- and when did they do it?""

"The Deep State tried to use an illegitimate tool to throw up a smokescreen to distract the American people from President Trump's success, says former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. Republicans in  Congress  defended  President Trump  on Friday after a report said a ""whistleblower"" filed a complaint over an apparent July phone call between the president and the leader of Ukraine, blasting the allegations as ""highly partisan."" “It’s not like we haven’t seen this movie before,"" U.S. Rep.  Jim Jordan , R-Ohio, told the Washington Post. ""Democrats come out, they’re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out -- Whoa, different story! “This seems to be the same kind of deal,"" Jordan added. “It’s not like we haven’t seen this movie before. Democrats come out, they’re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out -- Whoa, different story!"" WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM The complaint made by an unnamed intelligence official, reportedly involved Trump asking Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son for alleged wrongdoing while the elder Biden was vice president. U.S. Rep.  Mark Meadows , R-N.C., echoed the idea that such complaints hamper the president in his work. “It would have a real chilling effect on dialogue between important leaders if they think that every time someone who overhears a conversation that wasn’t even party to the conversation is going to file a whistleblower complaint and it’ll end up on the front page of periodicals across the country,” Meadows said, according to The Post. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., said private phone calls with foreign leaders are part of the president’s job. “The fact is, the president, to quote John Marshall, is the ‘sole organ’ of U.S. external relations and has to have conversations in confidence with foreign leaders,"" he said. “There’s no practical way to conduct diplomacy without it.” “The fact is, the president ... has to have conversations in confidence with foreign leaders. There’s no practical way to conduct diplomacy without it.” But he added he’s in favor of transparency. The administration is also taking flak for not sharing the complaint with Congress. Most Republicans avoided commenting on the complaint, and while a few did express concerns, they were limited. Rep. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., said it would be “wildly inappropriate” for a president to ask a foreign government to get involved in a U.S. election, but added he isn’t accusing Trump of doing that. Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, broke with Republicans in saying some on his side of the aisle might join Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., in subpoenaing the president's phone records. “It’s certainly on the table,” he said. “When I say that I want to protect congressional oversight, I really mean that.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump has denied any impropriety and in a Twitter message Friday, he called the unidentified whistleblower ""highly partisan,"" The  Post  reported."

"We've experienced the peaceful transfer of power for 230 years, including the constitutionally messy outcomes in 1876, 1888, 2000 and, well, 2016 for that matter. No tanks rolled through the streets and no shadow governments operated from underground bunkers even when the guy with the most votes didn't end up in the White House.  So why in 2019 do so many Americans -- across party lines --  believe  that if their candidate loses next year it can only be because the election was rigged?  Here's one place we can look: For the third time in his presidency, Donald Trump has an 86-point gap between what Republicans and Democrats think about him, according to the  latest Gallup approval poll . Ninety-one percent of Republicans approve of his job performance to date, while only 5% of Democrats feel the same.   This ties the highest gap  Gallup has ever measured in a single survey. President Obama had an 86-point gap two days before his reelection in 2012. President Bush hit the low 80s twice in the run up to his reelection. Reagan only made it into the 70s -- also in the fall of 1984. In all 3 cases, the partisan divide peaked during the days and weeks before a highly contested election.  We are still 14 months away from Election Day. But Americans on both sides appear primed and ready to vote.  Just four years ago , only 32% of voters said they were ""extremely interested"" in the 2016 election. But this week, that same poll shows 59% are extremely interested this time around. And if you only include self-identified partisans, the number jumps into the 60s.  And with stakes this high, Democratic voters appear to be grappling with their own dilemma: vote for a candidate who best exemplifies their visceral loathing for Donald Trump or vote for the candidate who is most likely to beat him?  Current polling shows the race for the Democratic nomination  is tightening  between Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren. But that doesn't mean voters are picking between them.  The polls are pretty clear that Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters  would prefer  to vote for Elizabeth Warren.  They think  she's won every debate so far. And as the 20,000 people who showed up to her New York City rally this week can attest, she leads Biden in voter  enthusiasm  by double digits.  But  nearly half  of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters believe that Biden is best positioned to beat Trump. Barely 1 in 10 think that of Warren.  If history is any indication, there's every reason to suspect the partisan divide heading into 2020 will get worse. After all, that 86% gap just means we have 14% more to go.   All of this is a big problem for Elizabeth Warren.   As David Leonhardt noted in the  New York Times  this week, Warren has struggled to win blue collar workers (you remember: the ones that gave Trump his narrow wins in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania?) in her own state of Massachusetts since 2012. She underperformed even her fellow down ballot Democrats in the last election. Voters on both sides of the aisle in these swing states are tuned in and eager to vote, but Biden out performs her in a head to head with Donald Trump in Wisconsin  by 9 points , for instance.  Of course, Joe Biden has his own lurking shadows.  Unlike Elizabeth Warren, who has developed her following based on her progressive appeal and solid debate performances, Biden's standing with the Democratic electorate seems largely driven by fear—fear of losing again to Donald Trump. If she can assuage that fear—or if another candidate can prove more viable—Joe Biden could be looking at a swift and total collapse. We've got a long way to go in this race, but the growing partisan divide around Donald Trump and the fear of losing to him in 2020 means electability will only grow in importance to Democratic primary voters. And that's bad news right now for every candidate whose name doesn't rhyme with Schmiden.   Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the 2020 election is 16 months away. "
"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Democratic presidential candidate  Bernie Sanders  released a plan Saturday to eliminate  $81 billion in past-due medical debt , going a step beyond his primary rivals who have called for a government-run health insurance program. “In America today, it is unacceptable that one out of every six Americans have past-due medical bills on their credit report, totaling $81 billion,” Sen. Sanders, I-Vt.,  said in a statement , adding: ""It is immoral and unconscionable that families across the country are being evicted, having their heat disconnected, or having their already-inadequate wages garnished because of crippling medical debt while the health care industry made more than $100 billion in profits last year."" SUPREME COURT COULD HEAR GROUNDBREAKING CASE THAT CHALLENGES UN IMMUNITY   Under his plan, Sanders said, the federal government would step in for the individual to negotiate and pay off past-due medical bills in collections reported to credit agencies. Sanders also vowed to create a public credit registry to replace the three for-profit credit reporting agencies in order to, as he put it: “remove the profit motive from assessing the creditworthiness of American consumers.” He said the registry would use ""public, transparent algorithm to determine creditworthiness that eliminates racial biases in credit scores."" The self-described democratic socialist added that he would exclude medical debt from credit reports and end credit checking for rental housing, employment, insurance and other non-lending practices. BIDEN GOES ON THE ATTACK OVER UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, PLEDGES TO BEAT TRUMP 'LIKE A DRUM' Sanders made no mention in the proposal of how he planned to cover the $81 billion cost.  According to Reuters , the Sanders campaign has said they would pay for the debt elimination proposal through a tax on corporations based on their pay for chief executives. The details of that proposal have not been released. During an interview with Fox News Sept. 3, Sanders acknowledged that $81 billion is ""a lot of money,"" but he added, ""Compared to what? Compared to the $1.5 trillion that Trump gave in tax breaks to the one percent and large corporations. Compared to the billions of dollars that we spent bailing out the crooks on Wall Street 11 years ago. It is a lot of money but I think it’s the right thing to do.” Sanders was one of the earliest supporters of “Medicare-for-All,” which would replace job-based and individual health insurance with a government-run plan. Other top Democratic rivals have expressed interest in a toned-down version of Medicare-for-All. Sen.  Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass. has endorsed Sanders' plan but said there may be different ways to achieve coverage for all. Former Vice President  Joe Biden  has called to extend the Affordable Care Act by adding a public option. Sanders has also released a plan to eliminate $1.6 trillion in student loan debt while also making public college tuition-free. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As for where he draws the line in wiping out debt, Sanders in his Sept. 3 interview said ""there's a difference"" between wiping out medical debt and credit card debt. ""I don't believe we wipe out credit card debt. You want something, you pay for it.,"" he said. ""If you want to go out and buy a fancy house, you want to go out and buy a yacht, and you go in debt, hey that’s your decision…But I do believe we have to make a distinction. Getting cancer is not your decision. And I think we have a moral obligation to do everything we can to cancel that debt.”"

"According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump did not offer a quid pro quo to Volodymyr Zelensky during the July call; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports. As Congress and the White House wrestle over a whistleblower’s complaint against  President Trump , the story took a new turn late Friday when the  Wall Street Journal reported  that, in a July phone call, Trump “repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine” to investigate the dealings of Joe Biden’s family in Ukraine. Trump’s call is reportedly the source of a complaint by a whistleblower against the president that has sparked a furor among Democrats in Congress, who are demanding to see the complaint. If, as multiple news organizations are reporting, the whistleblower’s complaint centers on Ukraine, there is strong evidence that it relates to President Trump’s urging the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son. NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT The story behind that story is itself worthy of serious scrutiny. The proposed investigation involves Hunter Biden’s involvement with a controversial Ukrainian natural gas company while then-Vice President Biden was overseeing America’s Ukraine policy. Critics of the president have accused Trump of attempting to “extort” Ukrainian officials for “dirt” on Biden, the current front-runner for the Democratic nomination to run against Trump next year. But why would Ukraine have dirt on Joe Biden? For answers, one must look at Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company which, until earlier this year, employed Hunter Biden. In April 2014,  Hunter Biden agreed  to join Burisma’s board of directors, ostensibly to advise on legal issues, The New Yorker reported. Biden had no known expertise on the natural gas industry, but Burisma was certainly in need of help. Earlier that month, British officials  had frozen  the London bank accounts of Burisma’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, and soon after, Ukrainian officials opened their own  corruption investigation  into Burisma, the Kyiv Post in Ukraine reported. Hunter Biden helped to recruit a legal team for Burisma, including former Obama administration Justice Department official John Buretta and several American consulting firms, The  New York Times reported. The younger Biden was well compensated for his efforts. Records obtained by the Government Accountability Institute show he was paid as much as $83,333 per month for his work at Burisma. Hunter Biden claims he had no role in the investigation of the company, and that he never spoke about it with his father – but the facts show a troubling overlap with the Obama administration’s actions in Ukraine. On April 16, 2014, White House records show that Devon Archer, Hunter Biden’s business partner, made a private visit to the White House for a meeting with Vice President Biden. Five days later, on April 21, Joe Biden landed in Kiev for a series of high-level meetings with Ukrainian officials. Soon the United States and the International Monetary Fund would be pumping more than $1 billion into the Ukrainian economy, as  I wrote in the New York Post . CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The next day, there was a public announcement that Archer had been asked to join the board of Burisma. Three weeks after that, on May 13, it was officially announced that Hunter Biden would join, too. Like Hunter Biden, Archer had no background or experience in the energy sector. In March 2016, Ukrainian officials fired Viktor Shokin, the controversial prosecutor general whose office was overseeing the investigation into Burisma, The  New York Times reported . Six months later, the Burisma case was dropped entirely, the  Kyiv Post reported . According to Joe Biden himself, the former vice president played a key role in the prosecutor’s dismissal. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In March 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loans if Shokin was not fired, according to Biden, who recounted the exchange in  a 2018 speech : “I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b----. He got fired.” While the propriety of Trump’s call to the Ukrainian president is certainly questionable and worthy of inquiry, the investigation he was hoping for certainly seems warranted on its own merits.

"President Trump and others put increased pressure on Democratic presidential rivals; Kristin Fisher reports from Washington. An article in the  Washington Post  this week was widely mocked for comparing Democratic  2020 presidential  hopeful  Sen. Elizabeth Warren  to historical icon Frederick Douglass -- over the way they posed for photos. WaPo reporter Hannah Natanson began her piece by pointing out that 19th century abolitionist Douglass (1818-1895) ""appears alone in almost every photograph, staring down the camera in isolated, thoughtful splendor,"" while Warren ""features today in countless iPhone photos and Instagram feeds, her arm around voter after voter, always bearing the same wide grin."" ""The two are separated by race, gender and more than 100 years of history that forged an America that would probably be unrecognizable to Douglass,"" Nathanson wrote. ""Still, experts say, their use of photography collapses the distance: Douglass sat for scores of pictures to normalize the idea of black excellence and equality, and Warren’s thousands of selfies with supporters could do the same for a female president."" WARREN GETS STUMPED BY COLBERT WHEN PRESSED ON MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES TO FUND MEDICARE-FOR-ALL The piece goes on to cite professors who support the comparison presented by Natanson that both Warren and Douglass were ""smashing stereotypes."" “She’s presenting a public image of herself as somebody who is presidential,” Columbia University professor Alexander Alberro said. “What Douglass tried to do was to create a public persona in the face of the negative type of image of African Americans at the time … so I think the comparison is really good.” Louisiana State University professor Nichole Bauer suggested that even if Warren goes on to defeat in 2020, her ""million selfies are just a little bit more of a crack in that glass ceiling.” Still, the comparison raised many eyebrows on social media. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Journalist Jordan Chariton went even further, accusing The Washington Post of ""propping up"" Warren and ""defeating"" her progressive opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. ""Just when you think @washingtonpost can't get anymore absurd in their campaign to prop up @ewarren (and defeat @BernieSanders), they are now comparing Warren taking selfies with people to......Frederick Douglass,"" Chariton tweeted."
"""The president asked a foreign power to help him win an election. Again,"" the former secretary of state tweeted, referring to Trump's call during the 2016 race for Russia to look into Clinton's deleted emails. Clinton's tweet included a video of  Giuliani's comments on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time""  Thursday, when Chris Cuomo pressed the former New York mayor over conversations he'd had with a  Ukrainian official  about Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who had investigated the former vice president's son, Hunter. ""Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?"" Cuomo asked Giuliani.  ""No, actually I didn't. I asked the Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016 by the Ukrainians for the benefit of Hillary Clinton, for which there is already a court finding,"" Giuliani responded. ""You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden and his role with the prosecutor?"" Cuomo asked. ""The only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that (Yuriy) Lutsenko, who was appointed, dismissed the case,"" Giuliani said. ""So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?"" Cuomo pressed. ""Of course I did,"" Giuliani said. When asked about his contradicting answer, Giuliani said he ""didn't ask"" for Biden to be investigated specifically, but asked Ukraine ""to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme."" Asked Friday if he discussed the former vice president with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed"" but that someone should look into Biden. During the 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump called on Russia, China and other hackers to turn over Clinton's emails. ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump said in July 2016.  Then-White House press secretary  Sean Spicer later said Trump was ""joking""  when he publicly asked Russia to hack his Democratic rival."
"WASHINGTON — Bernie Sanders has long wanted to remake the health care system so no one will have to pay directly for medical care again. Now, he also wants to go back and cancel all the medical debts of people who have been billed under the current system. In a plan released Saturday, Mr. Sanders,  the Vermont senator and presidential candidate , proposes  wiping out  an estimated $81 billion in existing debt and changing rules around debt collection and bankruptcy. He also calls for replacing the giant credit reporting agencies with a “public credit registry” that would ignore medical debt when calculating credit scores. The proposals reflect Mr. Sanders’s concern that the medical system has placed financial hardships on too many Americans, by discouraging them from seeking needed medical care — but also by saddling them with expensive and unfair bills that can harm their financial security, ding their credit and, in some cases, lead to bankruptcy.  The plan  is Mr. Sanders’s latest effort to transform the health care system in America, a goal on which he has staked not just his second presidential run, but much of his political legacy. His proposal also separates him from other  presidential candidates : While several of them have come to embrace his “Medicare for all” plan to create a government-run health insurance system, he is the first top-tier contender to call for such drastic measures on medical debt.  “We’re addressing it on both ends,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re addressing it now by trying to help the people who have past due medical bills. And we’re addressing it by finally creating a health care system that guarantees coverage to people without any premiums, without any deductibles, without any out-of-pocket expenses.” [ Sign up for our politics newsletter  and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Medical debt affects Americans who lack health insurance, of course. But it is also  increasingly affecting people who have insurance  with holes, like high deductibles or  limited networks  of doctors whose care is paid for.  Around 16 percent of adults with credit reports have at least one medical debt,  according to  a study  published last year in the journal Health Affairs. The plan calls for the government to negotiate and cancel the debts, though it does not specify the precise mechanism. While eliminating every American’s medical debt would probably not come cheap, Mr. Sanders’s plan could wind up costing far less than the total amount of debt he is seeking to cancel. Craig Antico, a founder of the charity RIP Medical Debt, which buys and forgives medical debt,  estimated that the market price for $81 billion in debt could be as low as $500 million . Most past-due medical debt never gets paid, which is why bill collectors are often willing to sell the debts for pennies on the dollar. The plan would also create a public credit rating agency to “replace” for-profit companies like Equifax, and it would exclude medical debts from credit ratings. It would establish a new legal process, managed by the bankruptcy court system, to help adjudicate medical debts that are not yet in collections. Studies suggest that medical debts can be less damaging to people’s credit than other kinds of debt, in part because the credit reporting agencies treat people’s ability to pay medical bills as less predictive of creditworthiness than, say, their ability to pay credit card bills or car payments. And, despite the news media’s focus on particularly large medical bills, the typical bill in collections is less than $600, according to the Health Affairs article. But medical debts do affect credit somewhat, and they can cause psychological stress, beyond the financial consequences. A  survey  of people with medical debts  conducted by The New York Times  and the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2016 found that 44 percent of adults under 65 who had problems paying medical bills said those bills had a “major effect” on their lives. Fear of medical debts causes some people to avoid needed medical care. And medical bills can affect other parts of people’s finances that are harder to measure, showing up as an unpaid credit card bill or a missed loan payment. “I have a belief that if a plan like this could eliminate the debt that’s causing hardship, it could make a huge difference in people’s lives,” Mr. Antico said. The Sanders campaign circulated statistics suggesting that more than 500,000 Americans declare bankruptcy each year because of medical bills. That number, derived from  a survey of bankrupt individuals , overstates the impact of medical bills on bankruptcy. The study itself noted that health problems can cause bankruptcies in two ways, through direct medical bills and through lost income due to illness itself. The 500,000 figure includes both groups.  Other research has shown that  income losses due to illness are often the bigger financial hit than medical bills . Neither Mr. Sanders’s “Medicare for all” plan nor his medical debt program would address that secondary issue, though he has also called for guaranteeing workers paid medical leave.   The plan “is well targeted,” said Neale Mahoney, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, who studies medical debt. “It just may not be that much relief.” [ Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week? ] Mr. Sanders said that, in conversations with people around the country, he had come to see medical debt as the most consistent and visceral manifestation of a broken health care system.  At an event this month in Carson City, Nev., for instance, he heard  from a veteran  who said he had $139,000 in medical debt. When Mr. Sanders asked the man how he would pay off the debt, the man responded: “I can’t. I can’t. I’m going to kill myself.”  Those kinds of deeply moving moments, he said, drove him to seek a new way to ameliorate that particular pain as part of his overall vision for changing the health care system.  “I have always believed that health care is a human right, and it has always disturbed me immensely that so many of our people are uninsured or underinsured and can’t go to the doctor,” Mr. Sanders said. “But I have learned in this campaign something else, which I didn’t talk about previously, and that is the financial pain that this dysfunctional health care system is causing people.” The new plan is part of a burst of policy-related activity from the Sanders campaign, which also released  a housing plan last week  that included a proposal to establish a  national rent control standard . Margot Sanger-Katz reported from Washington, and Sydney Ember from New York."

"Asked by CNN at Saturday's Iowa Steak Fry as she was leaving the grill area what steps Congress needed to take, the Massachusetts senator said, ""Impeachment, we need to start impeachment proceedings."" Warren, who is running for President,  first called for impeachment proceedings in April  after she read  special counsel Robert Mueller's report  on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.  Since then, she has repeatedly called for the House to begin impeachment proceedings but took it a step further Friday by calling Congress ""complicit"" in ""failing to act.""  ""After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment,""  she wrote in a tweet Friday evening . ""By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump's latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president."" She also wrote in a thread  that the President ""continues to commit crimes"" because ""he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won't either.""  She told reporters after a climate change town hall Friday evening that Trump ""continues to show that he has no regard for the law."" She did not address Biden in her tweets or with reporters. ""The way to hold the President accountable is for Congress to begin an impeachment proceeding. Congress hasn't done that,"" she told reporters in Cedar Rapids. ""And what the President has now demonstrated is that he thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors. He can go back to the well on exactly what he did before. And that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election. It's time for Congress to step up and begin serious impeachment proceedings against this man."" Trump pressed Ukraine's President to investigate Biden's son  during a call earlier this summer, a person familiar with the situation told CNN on Friday.  That call, which took place on July 25, a day after Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the intelligence community inspector general, the source added. The Wall Street Journal was first to report that Trump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the July phone call to investigate Biden's son, citing multiple people familiar with the matter."
"The labor union's show of strength so far has amounted to nearly 50,000 autoworkers indefinitely on strike with the promise of being compensated only $250 per week. The strike comes at a great time for the scandal-ridden union. It offers the UAW the opportunity to restore its tarnished reputation with workers after several UAW officials were  implicated in a federal probe  last week concerning embezzled member dues. Expenses were reported for luxury items such as golf outings, expensive cigars and extended stays in private villas among other things,  according  to a federal criminal complaint. The union issued this  statement  in response to the probe: ""While these allegations are very concerning, we strongly believe that the government has misconstrued any number of facts and emphasize that these are merely allegations, not proof of wrongdoing."" It makes you question whose best interest the UAW has in mind. On Sunday they  rejected  a contract offer from GM that met several of the union's demands and could have avoided a strike altogether. Instead, both workers and the company will experience losses while the UAW tries to play hard ball. Surely, the UAW wants GM to experience some pain in order to demonstrate its value. But how long are they willing to wait it out when autoworkers' livelihoods are on the line, especially when a reasonable deal seems obtainable.  Under the proposed contract  submitted  on Sunday before the strike began, GM would have invested $7 billion in 8 facilities in four states, promising over 5,400 jobs. Additionally, workers would have gotten lump sum pay increases and an $8,000 signing bonus, among other benefits. It's not a total win for autoworkers, but it's a respectable compromise that warrants serious consideration. This strike goes beyond the basic needs and working conditions of GM employees. It taps into growing public support for unions.  According  to a recent Gallup poll, 64% of Americans approve of labor unions. Others are piling on, using the strike to advance a larger agenda for American labor like increased unionization and worker benefits. Union support has been expressed by many high-profile Democrats, such as Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Of the strike, Sanders  called  on GM to ""end the greed"" and Ocasio-Cortez  tweeted , ""In a time of record profits, workers should prosper, not suffer. That's why unions play a key role in an economy that works for everyone."" Politicians who truly stand with the American worker, should call for more thorough investigations into corruption claims like that of the UAW embezzlement scandal. They could also support the Department of Labor in their union transparency efforts, such as the recent  proposed T-1 Rule , which will bring transparency to union-controlled trusts and expose financial corruption in those funds. Both workers and GM are losing a lot of money as a result of the strike. However, the UAW is benefiting from its show of strength, as are politicians and pundits rushing to make use of the strike to advance their agendas.  For the sake of the autoworkers who want to continue making GM a success, the UAW needs to more carefully consider the best interest of workers."
"To the Editor: So  far, so-called  “women’s issues,”  which are really everyone’s issues, have been missing from the debates. I want to see the candidates discuss: women’s reproductive health and freedom; the wage gap; domestic violence; the #MeToo movement; body shaming; underrepresentation on boards, in corporate upper management, in academia and in STEM fields; child care availability; and widespread cultural misogyny. After all, we do make up more than half the population.  Diane Kravif Los Angeles To the Editor: International  relations  have been consistently ignored. President Trump has seriously disrupted longstanding treaty commitments, agreements and positive relationships with many of our allies, while fawning over dictators. The United States is perceived as unreliable and untrustworthy. How would the candidates improve our foreign relations? Jeanne Pierrette Dross Albany  To the Editor: Having  lost a son to heroin use, I want to ask the following of the candidates: Our “war on drugs,” declared by President Nixon  in 1971 , is a dismal failure. The historian Alfred McCoy  wrote recently in The Nation   that “ instead of reducing  the traffic, the drug war has actually helped stimulate that ninefold increase in global opium production and a parallel surge in U.S. heroin users, from just 68,000 in 1970 to 886,000 in 2017.”  Drug deaths  reached  192 a day  in 2017, with many of them between the ages of 12 and 25.  That  is a silent Parkland … every day. What is your solution to this catastrophe? Bill Williams New York To the Editor: One  egregious omission to date from the Democratic debates is the future of  Social Security,  which according to recent projections will face a  critical funding shortfall  by 2034. This threatens the well-being of millions of Americans. Efforts to discredit and undermine the program, whether through benefit cuts or privatization, will ultimately erode the nation’s entire social welfare system. Individuals earning under $50,000 a year receive 90 percent of Social Security benefits. Nearly half of all racial minority retirees rely on them for all or nearly all of their  income .  It’s time Democrats debated this vital issue. Michael Reisch Baltimore The writer is a professor of social justice at the University of Maryland School of Social Work. To the Editor: No  one is talking about or seems to care about the  deficit and national debt . We are running a  $1 trillion deficit  during good times, so what happens when things go south, which they inevitably will? I don’t want to saddle my children with a huge national debt. Matt Carbone Valhalla, N.Y. The writer is an accountant.  To the Editor: There has yet to be any meaningful debate discussion of  the judiciary . The president has appointed over  150 judges  (and counting), including two Supreme Court justices, one of whom remains controversial a year after his appointment. I would like to hear questions about what the candidates would be looking for in their judicial appointments and also what they plan to do when their plans are inevitably derailed by judges appointed by this president. It may also be time to open a discussion of changes to the judiciary, such as term limits for judges. Should someone who is president for only four (or even eight) years really be able to reshape the judiciary for 40 years?  The Republicans are highly successful at getting their voters to the polls with promises of judicial appointments. It is beyond time for the Democrats to stress the importance of judicial appointments to their voters. If the president is re-elected, he will undoubtedly get at least one more Supreme Court appointment, and the consequences for the country would be dire. Judy Gitlin Valley Cottage, N.Y. To the Editor: I  offer the candidates not an issue to discuss but a plea to include in their discussion what has been absent:  the hope and promise of America . The candidates, rightly enough but relentlessly and angrily, point to what we do wrong, to our endless faults, our systemic racism, sexual harassment, cruel capitalism, economic injustices and widespread discrimination. Recall Ronald Reagan’s  “Morning in America”  ad. However shallow it may have sounded, and however much mocked, it resonated deeply, and we recall it even today.  Perhaps candidates should take a hint. Perhaps point to a vision, however imperfectly realized so far, of a country where liberty and justice are part of its promise and its future, a country for which so many sacrificed. Perhaps draw inspiration if not from Reagan then from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose message always remained one of hope, of a dream.  Mel A. Topf Providence, R.I.  To the Editor: The  issue of  affordable housing  for low- and moderate-income persons has not been adequately addressed. Although Senator Bernie Sanders and Julián Castro, former Housing and Urban Development secretary, have made fleeting references, I have not heard a thorough discussion of this problem, including homelessness. I believe that decisive federal action is necessary because local and state government simply lack the resources to solve this nationwide problem. Bob Ryan San Francisco To the Editor: It  is becoming increasingly apparent that Congress has ceded too much power to the unrestrained discretion of the president on matters such as tariffs, spending (on, for example, the wall) and war by invoking an “emergency.” There must be discussion about what the candidates would support to properly  rebalance power  between the executive and legislative branches. Joel Lutzker Greenwich, Conn. To the Editor: I  have an opposite suggestion: Ban all questions about health care. We need to hear about other pressing issues. David Martocci Interlaken, N.J. To the Editor: The  Democratic debates have virtually ignored numerous  national security  issues, particularly the bloated defense budget; the overzealous tempo of military deployments; the overabundant overseas bases; the unnecessary modernization of our nuclear weapons; and the troublesome decline of arms control and disarmament. The United States has become the dominant arms merchant in the international arena and has downplayed the important instrument of diplomacy. A manifesto signed by  Bertrand Russell, Albert Einstein and others  warned years ago: “ We have to learn  to ask ourselves, not what steps can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a military contest that will be disastrous to all parties?”  The Democratic debates would be a good place to start this conversation.  Melvin A. Goodman Bethesda, Md. The writer is a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy and former C.I.A. intelligence analyst. To the Editor: Millions  of workers are earning less than their parents did. This is true of those affected by automation and international trade and those with less than a high school education. They have not only lost income but also feel left out. What will the candidates do to increase the supply of well-paying, respected  jobs ? Peter Dawson Boulder, Colo. To the Editor: Debate  topics? How perfect that the mandate is “ no more than 200 words .” I’d like to see a discussion of the very  travesty of “debates” : prime-time manufactured, largely substanceless verbal contests with strict time limits. No nuance, no depth, no real follow-up.  It’s all sportscasting, replete with countdown clocks and sleazy previews and promotions, offering the promise of zingers, punches landed, gaffes, put-downs, rehearsed scripts, weaponized sound bites. Afterward are headlines about who won, who lost, who’s out, who came back.  How much better would be in-depth, challenging interviews, with follow-ups, rather than this sorry, unbearable sideshow.  Susan Wolfson Princeton, N.J. To the Editor: Agriculture  is being recognized as both the culprit and the savior in our race to combat climate change. I’d like to know what the candidates plan to do about the crisis affecting land stewardship and food production. In the Midwest, where I live, small farmers struggle to make a living, are ignored by federal and state governments, and often end up abandoning their important profession. It’s time to recognize that the fate of these farms is the canary in the coal mine. Vikki Proctor Evanston, Ill. To the Editor: One  glaring omission is  reproductive rights . While most candidates have at least alluded to protecting those rights, there has been no specific question about what each would do to keep the Supreme Court from reversing Roe v. Wade, even though a case challenging it is likely to come before the court in the next few years. Even more important, what would the candidates do to protect access to contraception, now covered in the Affordable Care Act? As The Times  just reported , the abortion rate is at its lowest since 1973, when it became legal, partly because of coverage of long-term contraception methods by Obamacare. Now the Trump administration is trying to roll back contraceptive coverage. How will the next Democratic president ensure that women have control over their reproductive lives? Ellen Sweet New York The writer is former vice president of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health. To the Editor: I  wish the candidates would address the  dysfunction in the Senate . Particularly, why does the Senate majority leader have such outsized power to shape national policy by controlling what the Senate will even consider? It is not a matter of constitutional law. It is just Senate rules — essentially a tradition, tacitly agreed upon among senators. The Senate does not reflect principles of democracy, and it needs reform. I would like to hear the leading candidates, several of whom are senators, discuss ways to reform the Senate and place some limits on the power of the majority leader.  Michael T. Ferro Endwell, N.Y. To the Editor: I  would ask: What rules or restraints would you impose upon yourself and others in your administration on  tweeting ?  Dick Stoll Milwaukee"
"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders sits down with Bret Baier following the debate. For the third straight time, the  Democratic  presidential debate in Houston led with a discussion of health care. As Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., put it: ""Every one of my colleagues on this stage believes in universal health care."" Booker’s statement prompts this question: Why should government get involved in health care for Americans who do not require government assistance? Most Americans believe the  government  should provide a ""safety net"" for the poor. It does this with assistance such as food stamps. However, you do not hear anyone calling for an expansion of food stamps to cover all Americans regardless of whether they are rich or poor. So why is that the case with health care? HOW MUCH WOULD 'MEDICARE FOR ALL' COST? DEMOCRATS' HEALTH CARE PLAN EXPLAINED The federal government, through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – more commonly known as food stamps – provides  assistance  to low-income people. The government does not make the food or control the price of food. It does not dictate what foods people should buy. And the government provides absolutely no food assistance to the majority of American households. This is a ""safety net."" It is designed to make sure the poorest among us have food on their table. There seems to be broad agreement that food stamps are a good way to address the nutritional needs of our poor. In health care, we have something similar. It is called Medicaid. It provides funding for medical services for low-income and disabled people. We also have Medicare, which provides health insurance coverage for older Americans. So the government already has programs in place to take care of the health of our poor and elderly. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Until President Obama came along, there seemed to be rough consensus that this was the right way to ensure America took care of its poor and elderly. Most Americans were, presumably, in a position to take care of their own health care. Most accomplished this by working in job that provided health benefits, buying their own insurance, or relying on a parent or spouse's health insurance plan. Others chose not to buy insurance and to pay for care as they received it. Obama and his fellow Democrats insisted that every American have government health care or private insurance, and thus devised ObamaCare, which expanded Medicaid to cover more Americans. In order to cover everyone else, for the first time in our nation’s history the federal government made it illegal not to purchase a particular product: in this case, health insurance. Yes, even if you paid tens of thousands of dollars for your child to become a doctor who could take care of you for free, you still were legally obligated to buy health insurance. Now health care is again front and center for Democrats. They say ObamaCare is not enough. They insist America must provide free health care for every single American, old and young, rich and poor. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., criticized former Vice President Joe Biden’s plan in the last debate because it only covered 97 percent of Americans! For his part, Biden proudly announced that under his plan the government will tell drug companies what they can charge for drugs. With government now involved in everyone’s health care, we are seeing the adverse effects. Everyone is now on government health care or mandatory insurance, and insurance premiums cost the same regardless of a person’s heath, destroying much of the free market in health care. Where are the menus of services with prices at the doctor’s office? They are not there because people do not care what the cost is because they don’t pay it! The government and insurance companies are in the middle, determining what and how much to pay, but never sure about what services the doctor or hospital actually provided. Fraud, therefore, runs rampant. Patients have no incentive to shop for better pricing, and doctors have no incentive to provide it. Patients similarly have no financial incentive to avoid doctor visits by maintaining a proper diet and exercise. As a result, we have runaway increases in the costs of health care. The Democratic solution? For Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others on the stage, it is to put the final bullet in what is left of the free market in health care. Progressivism has taken over the Democratic Party. It no longer believes in free markets. History shows that if government would get out of the way and allow the free market to do its thing, there is no telling what solutions would emerge for health care. New technologies utilizing the Internet, cell phones, Skype, and artificial intelligence would be fully exploited. Competition would bring down prices, as we have seen in areas of medical care not covered by the government or insurance companies. Sanders complains that America is ""the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people."" America also is the richest country on Earth. Has he ever considered that the two may be related? It is precisely because America does not hand over control of large sectors of its economy to the government that we have had such economic success. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Why is a safety net insufficient for Democrats? Is it about control? Is it about destroying free-market capitalism wherever they can? Is it in pursuit of a liberal utopia where everyone is treated the same? We do not know. The question was never asked.

"Katie Pavlich and Antjuan Seawright weigh in on how 2020 hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren will pay for 'Medicare-for-all.' Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , took a veiled shot at  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,  in Iowa Saturday for not moving to impeach  President Trump , suggesting that Pelosi's inaction enabled Trump to continue seeking foreign assistance in elections. ""Donald Trump did everything he could to obstruct justice. I read all 448 pages and when I got to the end, I called for the impeachment of Donald Trump,"" Warren said at the Polk County Democratic Party's Steak Fry fundraiser, referring to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report. ""Congress failed to act and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system,” she added. Her comments followed reports that the president repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to look into corruption accusations surrounding former  Vice President Joe Biden  and his son Hunter. NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT While many Democrats called for impeachment after the report surfaced, Pelosi reportedly has continued to oppose the ramping-up of impeachment proceedings. Warren, a  2020 hopeful , was just one of several to condemn Pelosi's inaction on the issue. ""This is absolutely insane,"" Jon Favreau, who previously served in the Obama administration, tweeted. ""We have lifelong conservatives writing pieces about how Trump should be impeached and  @SpeakerPelosi  ’s advisers are still telling reporters they refuse to hold the President accountable."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Favreau was responding a tweet by CNBC's John Harwood, which claimed that one of Pelosi's advisers put the kibosh on impeachment.

"""Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertion,"" Biden said Friday. ""Not one single one, and so I have no comment except the President should start to be president."" Biden said no more about the issue as he and his staff loaded into a van to depart the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, after hosting a town hall on Friday afternoon.  His remarks came as a communication between Trump and a foreign leader prompted  a whistleblower complaint that is now at the center of a dispute  between the director of national intelligence and Congress. The whistleblower's complaint deals at least in part with Ukraine, The New York Times and Washington Post reported Thursday night, prompting speculation that it could be tied to reports that the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, had asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.  Trump pressed Ukraine's President to investigate Hunter Biden during a call earlier this summer, a person familiar with the situation said Friday. In 2014, while Biden was vice president under President Barack Obama, Hunter Biden joined the board of a natural gas company called Burisma owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. In 2016, while Burisma was being investigated, Western governments, including the Obama administration, called for the removal of Ukraine's top prosecutor due to concerns about corruption in his office. Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor wasn't let go. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.  On Thursday, Giuliani denied asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden but moments later said he had done just that. Giuliani's comments came in a heated exchange on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" as Chris Cuomo pressed the former New York mayor over conversations he'd had with a Ukrainian official about Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of the prosecutor -- who had investigated Burisma. Earlier Friday,  Trump continued to blast news of the whistleblower complaint  in the Oval Office, calling it ""a ridiculous story."" ""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" he said, adding, ""It's just another political hack job.""  Trump said he doesn't know the identity of the person who made the complaint. Later Friday, Biden released a statement about the whistleblower complaint, saying: ""If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump's willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. ... At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress."" UPDATE: This story has been updated with additional context about the lack of evidence to support the allegations against the Bidens. "

"New questions surround Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son and his ties to the Ukraine; insight from investigative reporter Peter Schweizer, author of 'Secret Empires,' and Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, author of 'Witch Hunt: The Story of the Greatest Mass Delusion in American Political History.' Author  Peter Schweizer  on Friday night addressed the questions surrounding Hunter Biden’s involvement with a  Ukrainian natural gas company  while his father, former Vice President  Joe Biden , oversaw America’s Ukraine policy. ""The underlying story here involves Hunter Biden going around the world really collecting large payments from foreign governments and foreign oligarchs in the case of Ukraine,"" Schweizer, the author of ""Secret Empires,"" said on Fox News'  ""The Ingraham Angle."" CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT Joe Biden, now the Democratic presidential frontrunner for 2020, faced scrutiny for months over accusations that he pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who at that time was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Biden's son. Rudy Giuliani, a personal attorney for President Trump, has suggested that Biden worked to protect the company from investigation while in office. Biden said Friday that the claim has no credibility. The issue involving the Bidens resurfaced Friday after  The Wall Street Journal  reported that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine. Schweizer implied Hunter Biden's credentials didn't match with the position he held, and that the situation looked suspicious. ""He is supposed to be advising them on natural gas regulatory issues. He has no background in Ukraine. He has no background in energy or natural gas. So the question is, What is he being paid for? He's not being paid for his expertise, he has none,"" Schweizer said. ""His father at this time is the point person on U.S. policy to Ukraine."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The author said Trump was ""right"" to ask for an investigation and accused Hunter of lying. ""Donald Trump is right to ask the question and to ask that there be an investigation to see what Hunter Biden was being paid for. Joe Biden has offered no answers,"" Schweizer said. ""Hunter Biden, when he's been asked about this, has lied repeatedly and they've been proven lies by ABC News and other outlets.""

Credit Max Whittaker for The New York Times Bernie Sanders has gone much further than  any of the other 2020 Democratic presidential candidates  in proposing not just more money for affordable housing, or more enforcement of fair-housing laws, but also fundamental changes  in how the housing market functions .  His most startling ideas — a national rent control standard, and new taxes on land speculation and house  “flipping”  — would bring America closer to the idea that housing should be treated as shelter and not a commodity. But in the  housing plan his campaign released Wednesday , Mr. Sanders doesn’t go all the way there. He allows for profit, but not certain kinds of profit, or profit by certain kinds of actors. In that middle ground, somewhere between the private market and social housing for all, things get complicated. The national rent control standard Mr. Sanders has proposed would cap the amount that landlords can raise rents, to shield tenants from escalating housing costs and, in a deeper sense, the excesses of capitalism in the housing market. Landlords could raise the rent by no more than 3 percent per year,  or  one and a half times the rate of inflation, whichever is higher.  His housing plan says nothing about the profits of people buying and selling homes in the normal course of homeownership. In fact, Mr. Sanders would invest an additional $8 billion into federal programs to help first-time home buyers, precisely because homeownership in America is often a means of building wealth. Between the two proposals lies a fraught balance: One would curb profits in the housing market, while the other acknowledges that many Americans depend on those profits. Mr. Sanders’s campaign seeks to reconcile the two by arguing that rich investors or landlords shouldn’t get to make so much, while ordinary American families should have a chance to make something.  “We want to return to the notion that homeownership can be an asset builder for working people and average American families, and it is not just a vehicle to commodify to make the rich richer,” said Josh Orton, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign and its national policy director. In practice, however, it’s not always obvious how to distinguish the working families from the rich investors, or how to devise policies that crack down on the one but not the other. Some middle-class families, for example, build wealth by owning rental properties. And landlord groups are skeptical that 3 percent rent increases would build them much wealth, especially when property taxes, insurance rates and utilities aren’t also capped.  Mr. Sanders’s proposal would also put a hefty tax on house flipping, hitting owners who sell a property for more than the original price within five years of purchase (for a place they don’t occupy). But that definition would cover people we don’t think of as flippers: a small-scale general contractor who remodels two homes a year; a family that buys a home for an aging parent who later dies; a landlord who herself faces financial distress and must get out of the business. Mr. Sanders has similarly proposed a tax on empty homes, aimed at speculators who sit on vacant properties until they become more lucrative to redevelop, or simply profitable to resell. That is a real problem in some communities, leaving neighbors to live with blight for years. But owning an empty home doesn’t necessarily make you a speculator. Someone who has put a property on the market and struggled to sell it for months might end up facing this tax.  The full proposal, emphasizing the feel-good parts of the market but not the others, is trying to have it both ways, said Jenny Schuetz, a housing economist at the Brookings Institution who has been  following housing proposals from the 2020 candidates .  “In some ideal universe, people would buy homes (or rental properties) that appreciated slightly faster than inflation, allowing them to build wealth, but without housing costs rising too fast to pressure renters, deter new homeowners, or create excess capital gains,” Ms. Schuetz wrote in an email. “In that context, both rent control and flipping taxes make sense. The problem is, with any semblance of a private real estate market, land and housing values don’t behave that way.” She is skeptical that it is even possible to design or regulate a market that gives modest returns to individual homeowners, but never gives big returns to landlords; that penalizes greedy flippers, but never harms small-time contractors; that taxes vacant homes but doesn’t punish working families. Mr. Sanders’s ideas invite a host of questions about how they would technically work (how do we police a million landlords?) and where their legal authority would come from (would the courts uphold a national rent control law?). But these deeper questions about the kind of housing market voters might want seem worth hashing out, regardless of those other details. Mr. Orton, the Sanders adviser, pushed back against the logic of  economists  that, for one, rent control discourages developers from building and landlords from renting housing that Americans badly need. “I would say to those economists, how is that working out?” he said of the current deference to the market. “That’s what we’ve been doing. When we’ve left this to private developers, everything from the crash of the housing market to how we’ve seen gentrification just explode in some of the most vulnerable communities, to how we’ve seen people priced out of what would normally be affordable housing — this current crisis is the result of that.”"
"""This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power to get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things if that's what happened, that appears to be what happened ... This is outrageous,"" the former vice president and 2020 Democratic candidate told reporters on Saturday before attending the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry in Des Moines, Iowa. Biden's comments come following news that  Trump pressed Ukrainian President Vologymyr Zelensky  in a July 25 phone call to investigate Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the situation. Trump has defended the call, dubbing criticism of it a ""Ukraine Witch Hunt.""  There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Speaking to local media Saturday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said he didn't think Trump had tried pressuring Zelensky during the July call, but he stopped short of saying the subject of Biden's son wasn't raised.  ""There was talk ... leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on a lot of questions, sometimes requiring serious answers,"" Prystaiko said. Biden, when asked by reporters Saturday how many times he had discussed his son Hunter's overseas business affairs, said, ""I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,"" telling the reporter who posed the question: ""You should be looking at Trump."" ""Trump is doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum and he is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" he said, growing increasingly irritated. ""Everybody looked at this and everybody who's looked at it said there's nothing there. Ask the right question."" Trump on Sunday pointed to what he says is an inconsistency in Biden's statement, telling reporters Biden ""made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son."" Hunter Biden, according to a story  published in The New Yorker in July , said he and his father had previously discussed the matter one time, saying: ""Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing,' and I said, 'I do.' "" On Saturday, Biden turned to the Democrat's 2020 presidential challenge to Trump, calling the President a ""serial abuser,"" repeating that he knows what he's up against but that Trump ""crossed the line."" ""A serial abuser, that's what this guy is,"" Biden said. ""He abuses power everywhere he can. If he sees any threat to his staying in power -- he'll do whatever he has to do. But this crosses the line. This crossed the line."" When asked if Trump should be impeached for the call, Biden replied that ""depending on what the House finds, he could be impeached,"" but he declined to go further in calling for impeachment.  Biden also called for Trump to release the transcript of his call with Zelensky to Congress. Biden isn't alone in demanding details from the call. Earlier this month, the chairmen of the House committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight announced an investigation into allegations that Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani had pressured the Ukrainian government to back Trump's reelection campaign. The lawmakers requested a transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and the Ukrainian president -- which reports later identified as the date Trump allegedly asked for an investigation into Biden's son. Later Saturday, California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, promised ""something very big, early next week if we don't get the documents that we've asked for."" ""We're going to take very aggressive action,"" Khanna told CNN's S.E. Cupp on Saturday, refusing to provide particulars. ""It could be anything from subpoenaing people who were possibly involved in the call to doing everything possible to get the documents that we believe that we're owed."" This story has been updated to note what Trump says is an inconsistency in Biden's comment concerning discussions with his son."
"McAleenan called white supremacist extremism is one of the most ""potent ideologies"" driving acts violence in the US.  ""In our modern age, the continued menace of racially based violent extremism, particularly white supremacist extremism, is an abhorrent affront to the nation, the struggle and unity of its diverse population,"" he said in a speech at the Brookings Institution. He pointed to the attacks in  Poway ,  El Paso ,  Pittsburgh  and  Charleston , saying they were motivated by various extremist ideologies, including ""very concerningly and increasingly, white supremacist violent extremism."" According to McAleenan, ISIS and al Qaeda remain the ""two most pressing radical Islamist terrorist threats"" to the US with potential to direct plots and also to inspire homegrown violent extremism in their name.  The strategic announcement  comes just days after a judge ruled  that the American Airlines mechanic accused of trying to sabotage a commercial airliner before takeoff will be held in custody until trial. The judge said during a bond hearing that Ahmed Alani, who allegedly tried to damage or disable an aircraft's air data module system, ""may be very sympathetic to terrorists.""  Alani has been charged with ""willfully damaging, destroying, disabling, or wrecking an aircraft, and attempting to do so,"" according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court earlier this month. No terror-related charges have been filed. President Donald Trump has been criticized for not condemning white supremacy strongly enough, with some accusing him of exacerbating the problem.  Earlier this month, former Vice President Joe Biden connected Trump's rhetoric with the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, saying in a speech that the President has ""fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation."" In August,  CNN reported that White House officials rebuffed efforts  by their colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a year to make combating domestic terror threats, such as those from white supremacists, a greater priority as specifically spelled out in the National Counterterrorism Strategy, sources told CNN. Last October, the  White House unveiled its national counterterrorism strategy , which offered a broad strokes blueprint for how the Trump administration will and already has approached the threat of terrorism, from targeting terrorists at their source to beefing up efforts domestically to tackle the threat of homegrown terrorism.  Recently-ousted national security adviser John Bolton described the new strategy at the time as a sharp departure from President Barack Obama's approach to confronting terrorism, emphasizing the Trump administration's recognition of the threat as one rooted in radical Islamist ideology. ""Radical Islamist terrorist groups still represent the preeminent threat to the United States,"" Bolton said. ""We recognize that there is a terrorist ideology that we're confronting. And I think it's long been the President's view that without recognizing that we're in an ideological struggle, that we can't properly address the terrorist threat."""
"The Wall Street Journal reports that in a July phone call, President Trump repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to work with Rudy Giuliani and investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son. President Trump  faced fresh calls for impeachment on Friday after a new report claimed Trump asked the president of Ukraine numerous times in a single phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. Biden said on Friday that the claim has no credibility. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary  Julian Castro , a  2020 candidate , responded to the report by calling Trump a ""criminal"" who need to be impeached ""immediately."" WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., renewed his impeachment calls on Friday, accusing Trump of ""moral vandalism."" ""This story is stunning and should be shaking Washington right now -- Donald Trump's moral vandalism disqualifies him from being president. As I've said before, it's time for impeachment proceedings,"" he tweeted. Fellow 2020 contender  Beto O'Rouke  had already called for impeachment in reaction to statements made by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's attorney, on Thursday night. ""When will Congress have the courage to act?"" he asked in an apparent dig at leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. DEMOCRATS AREN'T ACTUALLY IMPEACHING THE PRESIDENT-- YET, BUT THEY ARE DIGGING DEEP Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, claimed the House had ""no choice"" but to impeach after the Journal's report surfaced. ""Everything Nixon did during Watergate pales in comparison to Trump using the power of the Presidency to pressure a foreign leader who needs U.S. Aid to investigate a political opponent,"" Pfeiffer said. The whistleblower controversy seemed to raise even more concerns among the 2020 field, many of whom already called for the president's impeachment. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , called on Friday for the whistleblower to come forward, offering protection as he defied the administration. She also suggested that Trump was trying to interfere in the 2020 election like, according to her, he did in 2016. ""He has openly invited interference and now we have information that suggests that again, he is engaged in that kind of behavior,"" she said at a campaign stop. ""What he fails to understand is that he is the President of the United States and that office ... is the people's office -- not his office,"" she added. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., didn't directly address the report on Twitter but did dispute Trump's attorneys' claims that he couldn't be criminally prosecuted. ""Yes, he can,"" she tweeted on Friday after the Journal's report surfaced. Trump, for his part, has denied any wrongdoing. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The Radical Left Democrats and their Fake News Media partners, headed up again by Little Adam Schiff, and batting Zero for 21 against me, are at it again!"" he tweeted, referring to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. ""They think I may have had a 'dicey' conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a 'highly partisan' whistleblowers ... statement."" ""Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!"" he added."
"Zelensky, a former comedian, secured a  landslide election victory in April . With no previous experience as a politician, he has to confront Russia's occupation of Crimea, as well as the ongoing conflict in the eastern region of Donbas with Russia-backed separatists. This may be a unique moment in the modern history of Ukraine. Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Trump, who are driven by their own respective political agendas, have suddenly inserted themselves in the midst of what could become an international imbroglio with Ukraine. But Putin, Trump and Zelensky have converging interests, and all three could potentially come out as winners in a scenario that leads to the withdrawal of Russian troops from eastern Ukraine, lifted sanctions on Russia, and the reelection of Trump. Ukraine has played a  key role in Russia's success  long before President Vladimir Putin rose to power. Ukraine's  fertile black-earth farmland  has long been a key Russian breadbasket, while the Donbas region is a major locus of heavy industry and  mineral reserves . Its Black Sea ports, particularly in Crimea, are  crucial to the Russian navy .  Even after the fall of the Soviet Union and Ukraine's independence, its rulers were often inclined to maintain  amicable relations  with Russia. In 2014, when the Maidan revolution toppled the pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Russian forces blithely moved in and annexed Crimea, then sent anonymous paramilitary forces known as ""little green men"" i nto the heart of Donbas . The European Union, along with the US, levied a series of tough  economic sanctions   that continue to weigh heavily  on the Russian economy. More than five years after the annexation, Putin remains desperate for these sanctions to be lifted. Now, Ukraine appears to have become at least as critically important to Donald Trump, for a whole different set of reasons. It is here, Trump seems to believe, that he can pin charges of  corruption on the son of Vice President Joe Biden , a Democratic candidate he clearly fears. And suddenly, both he and Putin appear now to have a Ukrainian president in power who is at the very least open for dialogue. At first,  Zelensky  supported Ukraine's eventual membership in the  European Union and NATO —both moves utterly anathema to Putin. Then the new Ukrainian leader proposed  ending the war  with Russian-backed forces in the Donbas by negotiating with Putin, and struck a hostage exchange with the Russian president that was lauded by President Trump as a ""first giant step to peace."" But he has also been especially interested in  ending the rampant corruption  that marked the  rule of his predecessor ,  Petro Poroshenko . Which is what seemed to give an opening to Donald Trump. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is  interested in what he describes as  Biden's efforts to oust Ukraine's top prosecutor because of an investigation into the natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where the former vice president's son Hunter Biden, had a role on the board  The allegation against the Bidens has been debunked by respected fact-checking teams at news organizations including CNN. At least one former official in the prosecutor's office  said the investigation into Burisma had already been shelved  by the time Joe Biden was pressuring Ukraine to replace its top prosecutor, who was unpopular among many Western leaders due to concerns regarding corruption. It's also unclear if Hunter Biden was a focus of that investigation when it was occurring.  Despite this, it appears Trump and Giuliani believe Zelensky should look into the matter. In May, Giuliani  abruptly canceled his trip to Ukraine  a day after he announced his intentions to meet with Zelensky in Kiev. Instead, he traveled to Spain in August,  and met with Andriy Yermak , a lawyer who serves as the president's aide.  According to  Politico , the State Department said that the meeting had been facilitated by  Kurt Volker , who has served abroad under four American presidents and is currently  executive director  of the McCain Institute for International Leadership and US Special Representative for Ukraine. I have known Volker as an individual of the utmost probity, and he, like the most seasoned American diplomats, clearly understands the need for all sides to feel as though they are coming out as winners. Which may be where the interest of all three key players converge. Consider this scenario. Putin would no doubt very much like to see a second term for Trump. Already, the American president is pressing fellow members of the G7 to welcome Putin back into the club next year, and floating the  idea that he will host the summit at his Miami golf resort . If Trump wins the 2020 election, he'll be freed from any need to win the support of voters. Trump would also presumably be free to move toward lifting sanctions against Russia, no matter how strenuously Congress -- and the rest of the western alliance -- might protest.  Zelensky, for his part, could do a big favor for Putin by digging into whatever Giuliani might want to help his client's presidential re-election effort. Putin, in turn, might even reciprocate by easing up on military actions in Donbas (though it is unlikely ever to return Crimea to Ukraine). In the Oval Office on Friday, Trump suggested he was not acting in his own personal interest by  saying  ""I always look for the conversation that's going to help the United States the most."" In the same discussion, he also described the whistleblower, who filed an official complaint,  as having a ""partisan"" agenda . Clearly hedging his own bets, Zelensky has held at least two c onversations with the Russian leader , and is also keen to  forge ties with the US .  The US released a $250 million military aid package days after  three House committees announced  a wide-ranging probe that would, among other things, look into whether such packages were being held hostage for the president's own political benefit. It is not unreasonable to expect that any future transactions would be smoothed by congenial relations between Zelensky and Trump, or even Putin. The key question: will Ukraine's new president calculate that he can win big points with the Kremlin by giving a little help to Trump, Giuliani and their campaign from more than 5,000 miles away? And how might this play out the next time Zelensky faces re-election, after winning a landslide victory on an anti-corruption campaign? Some of this could be sorted out next week in New York since, as the  Kyiv Post reported,  Trump and Zelensky might actually meet during the United Nations General Assembly session. Putin will  not be on hand , as has been customary in recent years. Certainly, clearing the air sooner rather than later, however, would by far appear to be in the best interest of all three leaders. Zelensky, Putin and Trump will need to set forth just where their most profound priorities—and loyalties—lie."

"Presidential hopeful Joe Biden says he has never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. He calls on President Trump to release the transcript of his call with the Ukraine. Former Vice President Joe Biden  went on the offense Saturday over  President Trump’s July phone call  with the president of Ukraine, in which Trump reportedly urged the leader to investigate Biden’s son’s dealings in the country -- with Biden backing calls for a House investigation and for the White House to release the transcript of the call. “Trump’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum, and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,” he told reporters in Iowa. NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT The Wall Street Journal  reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has  faced scrutiny  for months over his role as VP in pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as vice president, worked to protect the company from investigation. On Saturday, Biden said that he had never spoken to Hunter about his business dealings in Ukraine, and backed calls for the House to investigate -- as well as suggesting it could begin a path to impeachment. “Depending on what the House finds, he could be impeached but I’m not making that judgment now,” he said. “The House should investigate it, this appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power.” He went on to call Trump a “serial abuser.” “He abuses power everywhere he can and if he sees any threat to staying in power, he’ll do whatever he has to do -- but this crosses the line,” he said. CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP PHONE CALL CENTERS ON UKRAINE, AS PRESIDENT DECRIES 'PARTISAN' COMPLAINT Biden’s remarks came just hours after Trump dismissed the controversy as a “Ukraine Witch Hunt” being stoked by the Democratic Party and the “fake news media,” and said that the real scandal was to do with Biden’s interactions in the country. “The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won’t get a very large amount of U.S. money, so they fabricate a.story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine,” he tweeted. “Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. The Fake News knows this but doesn’t want to report!” What initially touched off the  controversy is a secret  whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ""promise"" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. Trump dismissed the story as “ridiculous"" and a ""partisan hack job"" from the Oval Office on Friday and said his calls with foreign leaders are “always appropriate.” The whistleblower complaint led House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democrats to call for an investigation and for the administration hand over the complaint as well as a transcript of the call -- even as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire declined to share details with lawmakers. Maguire is expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. after being subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee. Schiff had accused Maguire of withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioned whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On Saturday Trump said that the media was turning the story into one about him, as they are trying to “protect” the Democratic frontrunner. “Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden,” he tweeted. “Will fail again!” Fox News' Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"That call, which took place on July 25, one day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about Russian interference in US elections, was also part of  a whistleblower complaint  submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, the source added, a revelation that is likely to raise more questions in the ongoing controversy.  The Wall Street Journal  was first to report that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the July phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son Hunter, citing multiple people familiar with the matter.  The Journal also reported that Trump told Zelensky ""that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know"" whether allegations were true or not, one of the people said, according to the Journal.  Trump did not discuss a pending aid package to the country in the July 25 call, indicating that there may not have been an explicit quid pro quo outlined by the President in the conversation, the source familiar with the issue told CNN.  A readout of the call put out by the Ukrainian government says, ""Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA."" Joe Biden responded to the new revelations in a strongly-worded statement Friday.  ""If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump's willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation—a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia—pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor,"" Biden said.  ""Such clear-cut corruption damages and diminishes our institutions of government by making them tools of a personal political vendetta. At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress,"" he added. Trump downplays whistleblower's claims  Before the Journal's report was published, Trump downplayed the significance of the whistleblower complaint at the center of the latest controversy consuming Washington. During remarks in the Oval Office Friday, Trump claimed the whistleblower is partisan and his conversations with foreign leaders are ""appropriate."" But in a back-and-forth with reporters, Trump did not deny discussing Biden with Zelensky in that July phone call -- a potential subject for the complaint. ""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" Trump said prior to the Journal's report being published while appearing alongside the Australian Prime Minister, who he was hosting for a state visit. Precise details of the accusation aren't known, much to the chagrin of Democratic lawmakers, who have demanded more information. ""To ask a foreign leader to interfere in a presidential election - right after a year long investigation into potential foreign interference in a presidential election - would be pretty extraordinary. Even for these times,"" Connecticut Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy tweeted Friday in reaction to the news.   Trump admitted Friday he did not know the whistleblower's identity, and said he wasn't even sure if it was his conversation with Ukraine's leader that was the topic of the complaint. But he nevertheless appeared defensive about his interactions with Zelensky, with whom he will meet next week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Trump still pushing Biden claim Asked whether he'd discussed Biden with Ukraine's Zelensky during a phone call in late July, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed,"" but insisted that someone should look into Biden. ""It was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor's taken off the case,"" Trump said, appearing to refer to January remarks when Biden discussed his interactions with Ukraine's leadership when serving as vice president. Appearing  in a rambling interview on CNN on Thursday evening , Giuliani admitted he had discussed Biden with Ukraine's leaders during a visit to the country. Giuliani has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden's call in 2016 to remove the country's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company connected to Biden's son, Hunter. Other Western governments also called for that prosecutor's dismissal, and no evidence has indicated Biden's move was inappropriate. Ukraine's prosecutor general told Bloomberg in May he had no proof of wrongdoing by Biden or his son. Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian President has come under scrutiny from House investigators and they have demanded more information about Trump and Giuliani's interactions regarding Ukraine and the Biden matter, including calls for a transcript of Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president. Democrats are also looking for more information about the whistleblower's complaint. ""There's a real sense of urgency here since the Inspector General was so clear this is not something that can wait,"" said House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff on Friday, a day after his panel was briefed behind closed doors by the inspector general."
"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Saturday dismissed news reports that he  urged the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son  as little more than a “witch hunt” and said his dealings were “perfectly fine” and routine. “Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He said that any effort to investigate him would fail, comparing it to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into his ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign. The news reports he was referring to have revealed the existence of a secret whistle-blower complaint that is believed to have been filed, at least partly, in response to Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The New York Times  reported  Friday that Mr. Trump, in a July call, pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Biden’s son, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Mr. Trump, intensifying a line of attack he and his allies have stoked for months, said the real problem was Mr. Biden, who according to most polls is the leading candidate in a crowded Democratic field and has framed himself as the most likely to defeat Mr. Trump in the general election. “The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,” Mr. Trump wrote, “so they fabricate a story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine.” No evidence  has surfaced to bolster Mr. Trump’s claim that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor general’s dismissal. Another tweet from Mr. Trump , which featured his campaign’s phone number, included a series of video clips featuring journalists, including some from The New York Times, discussing Mr. Biden and Ukraine on television news programs. Citing the reports by journalists seemed ironic given the president’s claim that the media had not reported on Mr. Biden. But the tweets signaled that Mr. Trump and his campaign organization would be doing as much as possible to sow doubt about Mr. Biden. Friday’s reports on the president drew strong reactions from top Democrats and, for some, brought a new urgency to calls for Mr. Trump’s impeachment. “There is no bottom. Impeach him,” Beto O’Rourke said on Friday evening. And Joe Walsh, a former congressman from Illinois who has launched a long-shot challenge to Mr. Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, urged others in his party who were alarmed by the president’s behavior to come forward. “He doesn’t believe in the rule of law,” Mr. Walsh wrote on Twitter on Saturday morning. “He abuses his power whenever he wants. He lies at will. He doesn’t know the meaning of checks & balances. And he sees nothing wrong with telling a foreign government to dig up dirt on his opponents. Come on Republicans. Be better than this.” Although Mr. Mueller wrote in his report that he found “insufficient evidence” to accuse the president or his advisers of a criminal conspiracy with the Russians, his investigators said his campaign welcomed Moscow’s intereference and expected to benefit from it. Democrats are using Mr. Mueller’s findings as part of the basis for their impeachment inquiry. Mr. Biden, for his part, has dismissed the president’s attacks. “If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country,” he said in a statement released after The Times and other new organizations, including The Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, reported Mr. Trump’s conversations with Mr. Zelensky. “This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes.” For years,  the Bidens have faced questions  about the association of Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, with one of Ukraine’s largest natural gas companies, and whether or not there was any connection to Mr. Biden’s efforts as vice president to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor whose office had authority over investigations of the oligarch whose company paid his son. Mr. Biden’s son earned as much as $50,000 per month in some months for his work for the company, Burisma Holdings. This year, the current Ukrainian prosecutor general reopened an investigation into Burisma just as Mr. Biden began  his 2020 presidential campaign ."
"David Webb, Donna Brazile and A.B. Stoddard on whether not Joe Biden will win the African-American vote. Former Vice President Joe Biden will need to rely on ""older"" African-American voters if he hopes to win the White House in 2020, according to A.B. Stoddard. “This age divide in the African-American electorate is the crux of Joe Biden’s viability,” Stoddard told  “The Daily Briefing”  with Dana Perino. “If he loses older African-Americans along with his non-college white support, he won’t be the nominee,” she said. The comments came after The New York Times ran a column titled,  “Young Black Voters to Their Biden-Supporting Parents: ‘Is This Your King?”  The piece looked at views of younger black voters, which in many case differ from theirs of their older counterparts. FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN AT NEW LOW IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE Stoddard said that the reason older African-Americans support the former vice president is that “they are afraid” and want to beat  President Trump . “They believe that the Obama presidency led to a flare-up of racism in this country, and President Donald Trump. They want to beat him,” she said. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS Stoddard went on to say that older black voters believe the new direction of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party -- its vow to decriminalize border crossings, take away private insurance and stand up for other “radical positions” -- is “out of step with the country.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden  has been considered the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination since before he even entered the race. However, while he currently still leads the field, his support has been diminishing, according to a new Fox News Poll. Biden has the support of 29 percent of Democratic primary voters, according to the poll. That figure is down from 31 percent in August and 35 percent in May. His current 11-point lead is down from a high of 19 points in June."
"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Former Vice President Joe Biden  is facing accusations of  sexism  this week after he pushed back on a female moderator's question about his record. The incident occurred at the ""LGBTQ Presidential Forum"" hosted by GLAAD and the Iowa Gazette on Friday. One of the Gazette's writers, Lyz Lenz, seemed to question Biden's progressive bona fides when she asked about his opposition to the  ""Don't Ask Don't Tell""  policy and a compliment he paid to Vice President Mike Pence.

       ""You have also praised  Vice President Mike Pence  as a decent guy,"" Lenz said, drawing boos from the crowd. ""You're a lovely person,"" Biden shot back with a smile on his face. Lenz defended herself, saying that she was just ""asking the questions that people want to know."" According to some, like Time Magazine editor Anand Giridharadas, Biden's response was related to the moderator's gender. ""Last week, Joe Biden gave us an occasion to talk about 'racism with a smile.' Now he’s doing 'sexism with a smile.' Watch him grow angry at  @lyzl 's solid question -- and then try to slap her down in the most patronizing way,"" Giridharadas tweeted on Saturday. Jamil Smith, a senior writer at Rolling Stone, similarly accused Biden of ""Paleolithic behavior."" ""I admire Lyz’s professionalism in this moment,"" he tweeted. ""Sad that it was even necessary. Biden keeps exhibiting this kind of Paleolithic behavior, and too many folks will excuse it because they’re used to seeing their male elders act like way. There is no such thing as benevolent sexism."" Others piled on with critical tweets on Saturday. After the exchange on Friday, Lenz hinted that Biden continued his sarcasm as she walked off the stage. ""As I was walking off the stage with  @JoeBiden  he said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart,'"" she  tweeted. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The former vice president has also faced scrutiny for allegedly  inappropriately touching  women and his longtime support of the  Hyde Amendment , a policy blocking taxpayer funding of most abortions.  Biden announced he had changed his stance  and opposed the Hyde Amendment earlier this year, shortly after his run for the presidency."
"The Democratic field got a little bit smaller this week,  shrinking to 19 candidates . Here’s our weekly catch-up on the  2020 election  and some moments you may have missed. ‘Clearly not my time’ Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who entered the Democratic presidential race on the hopes that his brand of urban progressive leadership could appeal on a national scale,  said on Friday that he was ending his candidacy . Breaking: Bill de Blasio announces he is ending his presidential campaign  pic.twitter.com/vL8GcX3xV5 — Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe)  September 20, 2019 
 Mr. de Blasio’s campaign never quite caught on, and his announcement came less than two weeks before the qualification deadline for the  October debate . His inclusion in the event was growing less likely by the day.  “I feel like I’ve contributed all I can to this primary campaign, and it’s clearly not my time,” he said in an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “I’m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City, and I’m going to keep speaking up for working people.” Read more about  Mr. de Blasio’s exit here .  And here’s  our magazine piece  about his journey from progressive hope to punching bag. A big day for Warren  Monday was big for Senator  Elizabeth Warren  of Massachusetts.  She  received the endorsement of the Working Families Party , a labor-aligned progressive group that endorsed Senator  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont  during the last presidential cycle .  She released a 6,000-word  anti-corruption plan , which would make the release of tax returns automatic for candidates for federal office, make it illegal for elected officials to become lobbyists and strengthen ethics requirements for federal judges.  And in a speech at a rally in Manhattan that drew thousands to Washington Square Park, she forcefully attacked corruption and invoked the power of women to bring about sweeping change.  Ms. Warren delivered the speech blocks from the site of the  Triangle shirtwaist factory fire  of 1911, which killed 146 garment workers, most of them immigrant women. It was one of the deadliest industrial disasters in the nation’s history. “The tragic story of the Triangle factory fire is a story about power,” Ms. Warren said. “A story of what happens when the rich and the powerful take control of government and use it to increase their own profits while they stick it to working people. But what happened in the aftermath of the fire is a different story about power — a story about our power, a story about what’s possible when we fight together as one.” Our colleague Alexander Burns noted that in dueling speeches Monday night, Ms. Warren and President Trump  laid out competing visions of populism . Sanders shakes up his operation With five months to go before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Sanders  overhauled his operations in the state , which he won by more than 22 percentage points in 2016.  Mr. Sanders, who hails from neighboring Vermont, almost certainly must win New Hampshire again next year to have a chance at the nomination. The campaign also parted ways with its political director in Iowa,  according to a report  that surfaced later in the week.  Read more  about that move here. ‘A sham process’: Democrats call for Kavanaugh’s impeachment Several candidates called for the impeachment of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh after The New York Times published  new information  about allegations of sexual misconduct against him. Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Senator Kamala Harris of California were among those who called for the justice’s impeachment. “He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice,” Ms. Harris wrote. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called the revelations “profoundly troubling” but stopped short of demanding impeachment. Instead, he called for an investigation into “whether the Trump administration and Senate Republicans pressured the F.B.I. to ignore evidence.” Read  our full report  on the calls for impeachment. Regulating marijuana like alcohol Former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas  released a plan  on Thursday to legalize marijuana, expunge all possession convictions and regulate the substance the way alcohol is regulated. Sales would be limited to adults, smoking would be banned in public areas, and advertising would be restricted.  He also wants to tax the marijuana industry and invest the revenue in the communities of color disproportionately affected by the war on drugs.  Every Democratic candidate supports decriminalizing marijuana, and most, including Mr. O’Rourke, support full legalization. But six candidates — Mr. Biden, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., and former Representative Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania — want to leave the question of legalization up to the states. In other policy news: Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey  unveiled a plan  to bolster workers’ rights. It would protect the right to organize for all workers, including those in the gig economy; end anti-union “right-to-work” laws; and change the way capital gains are taxed. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., released  a disaster preparedness plan  to help communities prepare for and recover from storms. It aims to improve coordination between federal agencies and storm victims, fortify infrastructure and strengthen the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Mr. Buttigieg also detailed his  “Medicare for All Who Want It” plan , which seeks to ensure universal access to coverage by allowing all Americans to opt in to a public-coverage alternative.  Mr. Sanders  introduced a $2.5 trillion housing proposal  that calls for more public and affordable housing,  as well as a national rent control law  that would cap annual rent increases at 3 percent or one and a half times the inflation rate, whichever was higher.  Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund executive, released a  “justice-centered climate plan ,” which he said would create nearly   46 million jobs over 10 years. He also promised to create a civilian climate corps as part of a broad  “national service plan ,” which would aim for a million annual participants by 2025.  And finally ... Overheard on the campaign trail? “I’m moving to Iowa,”  Ms. Harris joked in a comment   to Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii that included an expletive and was overheard by a reporter. The state of California did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Ms. Harris’s remark came as  her campaign announced a new push in the state . In a call with reporters Thursday morning, aides said they hoped to position Ms. Harris for a late-breaking Iowa surge. And they set a firm target: a top-three finish. Ms. Harris’s team sent out a fund-raising email based on her quip. And, of course,  there are already T-shirts . "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump pressed the Ukrainian president in a July call to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son, according to a person familiar with the conversation, an apparently blatant mixture of foreign policy with his 2020 re-election campaign. Mr. Trump also repeatedly told the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, to talk with his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had been urging the government in Kiev to investigate Mr. Biden and his family, according to two other people briefed on the call. Mr. Trump’s request is part of the secret whistle-blower complaint that is said to be about Mr. Trump and at least in part about  his dealings with Ukraine , according to two people familiar with the complaint. Mr. Biden is a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. The president has made no secret that he wanted Ukraine to investigate any improper overlap between Mr. Biden’s own diplomatic efforts there and his son’s role with a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. “Someone ought to look into Joe Biden,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday in response to a question about his call with Mr. Zelensky. The revelations added urgency to questions about Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, which is battling Russian-controlled separatists in the country’s east. When the president sought the Biden investigation, the Trump administration’s military aid to Ukraine had been frozen for weeks. The United States suspended that assistance in early July, according to a former American official. Mr. Trump did not discuss the aid in the July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky, whose government did not learn of the suspension until August, according to people familiar with the call. The Wall Street Journal  first reported  details of the call. For Democrats who want to examine the whistle-blower complaint — itself the subject of  an internal administration dispute  over whether to hand it over to Congress, as is generally required by law — the key question is whether Mr. Trump was demanding a quid pro quo, explicitly or implicitly. Democratic House committee chairmen  are already investigating  whether he manipulated American foreign policy for personal political advantage and have requested the transcript of the Zelensky call. The growing controversy had echoes of the dominant scandal of the first years of Mr. Trump’s administration: whether his campaign sought help from Russia to benefit him in 2016. Ultimately,  the special counsel found  that although “insufficient evidence” existed to determine that Mr. Trump or his advisers engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the Russians, his campaign welcomed Moscow’s election sabotage and expected to benefit from it. Any attempt by Mr. Trump to ask a foreign power to “dig up dirt” on a political rival while withholding aid is corrupt, said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, one of the panels examining Mr. Trump’s Ukraine dealings. “No explicit quid pro quo is necessary to betray your country,”  tweeted Mr. Schiff , who has also pushed for the whistle-blower complaint to be given to Congress. Mr. Trump opened a direct counterattack on Friday against the whistle-blower, whose identity is unknown, as are many details about the complaint. The president dismissed the allegations and labeled the whistle-blower, without evidence, a political partisan. “It’s a ridiculous story. It’s a partisan whistle-blower,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, though he acknowledged he did not know the person’s identity. “They shouldn’t even have information.” Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have pressed for an investigation of the Bidens for weeks, after reports this year in  The New York Times  and  elsewhere  examined whether a Ukrainian energy company sought to buy influence in Washington by hiring Mr. Biden’s younger son, Hunter Biden. The younger Biden had a lobbying business in Ukraine while his father was vice president. When he was vice president, Mr. Biden cast himself as both the Obama administration’s advocate of military assistance to Kiev as well as the chief antagonist of the notorious corruption in Ukraine’s government. In early 2016, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in American loan guarantees if Ukraine’s top prosecutor was not dismissed after accusations that he had ignored rampant corruption. Mr. Biden succeeded; the prosecutor general was voted out office. And Hunter Biden had an interest in the outcome: He sat on the board of an energy company that had been in the sights of the ousted prosecutor general. On Friday, the former vice president accused Mr. Trump in a statement of using the power of the United States to extract “a political favor.” Mr. Biden called for the president to release the transcript of his call with Mr. Zelensky and said that if the reports about it proved true, “there was no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.” He also said the allegations that he or his son committed wrongdoing in Ukraine were baseless. “Not one single outlet has given any credibility to his assertion,” Mr. Biden told reporters after a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Controversy over the Trump administration’s Ukraine policy has swirled for weeks but has been confined mostly to foreign policy experts. The revelations about the whistle-blower complaint plunged the issue into the center of the political debate. Congress has still not seen the whistle-blower’s allegation. Although the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, has sought to provide it, the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has blocked him in  a dispute over legal requirements . Mr. Maguire and his general counsel decided against providing the complaint to Congress after consulting with Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, according to a person familiar with the move. Mounting evidence that the White House was involved in the effort to withhold the complaint from lawmakers has stirred anger on Capitol Hill. Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Mr. Maguire of violating the law. “If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,” she added in a statement. Republicans were largely silent about Mr. Trump’s calls for a foreign investigation of his political rival. Their apparent desire to avoid criticizing the president during a political crisis stood in contrast to the criticism from party members after the administration froze aid to Ukraine. The administration, critics said, has struggled to explain the move, which has convinced some Democrats that it was part of an effort bring about a Biden investigation. “They have no shame,” said Michael Carpenter, a former aide to Mr. Biden and expert on Ukraine. He added: “They released the assistance in mid-September after the bipartisan uproar over the freeze — and under pressure from the House investigations. But strikingly, the administration never articulated why the assistance was frozen in the first place.” Mr. Giuliani has spearheaded a push for a Biden inquiry. He  met with Mr. Zelensky’s emissaries  this summer in hopes of encouraging his government to pursue investigations into the family as well as whether Ukrainian officials took steps during the 2016 election to damage Mr. Trump’s campaign. Mr. Giuliani has said he was acting on his own, though his comments on Thursday seemed to draw a closer connection to Mr. Trump. “A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job,”  Mr. Giuliani tweeted  shortly after  an appearance on CNN,  where he first denied, then admitted, asking the government in Kiev to investigate the Bidens. Although they agreed to meet with Mr. Giuliani, the Ukrainians have so far refused to open the investigations. But there is little doubt the pressure from Mr. Trump is causing stress on the new government, according to a former Ukrainian official. Since 2014, Ukraine has been under attack by Russia and its proxy, a fight that has become a grinding conflict that has made it difficult for Kiev to continue its overhaul efforts and work to become more integrated with Europe and the West. But now Ukraine also finds itself potentially at odds with the leader of its most critical partner, the United States, and at the center of a political battle in Washington. Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky  will meet next week  on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, a senior administration official confirmed on Friday after Mr. Zelensky’s office announced the meeting. But the administration has put off any commitment for a White House meeting, which Mr. Zelensky views as critical for the relationship."

"Fox Nation host  Tomi Lahren  blasted the latest controversial proposal from 2020  Democratic  presidential candidate Bernie  Sanders , I-Vt., to spend a whopping $2.5 trillion to guarantee housing for every American. “Guaranteed housing, add that to the list of socialist agenda items that sound good to some, but in reality, are just big government solutions that move our nation away from freedom and closer to  socialism ,” said Lahren on  Fox Nation’s  “Final Thoughts.” TRUMP SAYS CALIFORNIA CITIES 'DESTROY THEMSELVES' WITH HOMELESSNESS On Wednesday, Sanders unveiled his “Housing for All” plan. The progressive senator said there’s a shortage of 7.4 million affordable homes for the lowest-income renters. And he stressed that more than 18 million families across the country are paying more than half of their limited incomes on housing and utilities. A spokesman for President Trump's reelection  campaign  called it ""yet another pie-in-the-sky, big government socialist promise by the Bernie camp."" Lahren panned the plan as “another giant, expensive federal program” and blasted Sanders’ plan to pay for it all. “How does he plan to pay for it? The way all these Democrats plan to pay for their radical proposals, taxation.  Bernie claims a wealth tax on the top 1/10 of 1 percent of Americans will fund his initiative.” She continued, “Well, folks, he and others in his party already plan to dump the burden of Medicare-for-all, free college, medical debt cancellation, and the Green New Deal on the backs of the wealthy. Do they really think the top 1 percent can afford to fund the entire nation? Total income confiscation wouldn’t pay for all those programs!” Lahren argued that increasing taxes on the wealthy encourages them to move, leaving the middle class to foot the bill. “Here’s the thing about wealth, Bernie, it’s MOBILE. Meaning the wealthiest Americans are not going to sit idly by as their incomes are confiscated to fund your big government pie-in-the-sky plans,” Lahren said. She continued, “Then what? What happens when the richest Americans take their money elsewhere? Who pays for these quasi-socialist plans? Answer, we do. The middle class, the average American.” The concern that the wealthy may move to avoid paying taxes is not a hypothetical, according to Lahren. She said that is exactly what has happened in her state. “That’s why the middle class has been driven out of places like California, for cryin’ out loud. It’s only affordable for the exorbitantly wealthy and the homeless!” LAHREN ON AMERICAN UNITY AFTER 9/11: 'WE HAVE JUST LOST IT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY' Finally, Lahren said that Sanders’ proposal would not decrease homelessness. “I live in California, the state that is comprised of 47 percent of all unsheltered people in the nation. Yet what do we do here in California? We add more taxes, more regulations, more control on top of already cash-strapped residents and families. Here’s what else I know, throwing more government and more taxpayer dollars at the problem does not solve the problem. If it did we wouldn’t be in this predicament right here in California.” Lahren concluded, “When will these socialist wannabes figure it out?  Throwing taxpayer dollars, big government and entitlement at the problem does not solve the problem. It just moves our nation one dangerous step closer to socialism. Maybe that’s what people like Bernie want but it’s up to us to stand in his way.” To see Lahren's full remarks and for more episodes of Tomi Lahren's daily commentary offering a refreshing and unfiltered perspective on issues across the country, join  Fox Nation  and watch  ""First & Final Thoughts""   today.

Maher began the show's panel-discussion segment by citing the ""Kavanaugh effect"" and the implication that four vulnerable Democrats lost their U.S. Senate seats in 2018 because of their opposition to the then-Supreme Court nominee -- noting that Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who backed President Trump's appointment of Kavanaugh, was the only red-state Democrat to keep his job.

But the Times was forced to issue an  update  that included the significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the purported sexual assault. The newspaper also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode.

THE SHADOW OF CORRUPTION How corrupt do you think your government is? 
According to Transparency International, which has been ranking countries on its 1-100 scale for 25 years, the United States is not very corrupt at all. 
The  most recent rankings , built through a survey of experts and businesspeople, ranks the U.S. as 22nd cleanest in the 180 nations of the world. We run in a pack with other mostly Western liberal democracies like Australia, Britain and France just behind the squeaky clean Scandinavian nations and, of course, Canada. 
We are far removed from the rampant corruption under which most of the rest of the world is forced to live. Russia, China, India and Brazil are all bad news when it comes to basic principles of fairness. All of Africa except for Botswana and every Asian nation except Japan are considered substantially corrupt.   
So your government, on an empirical basis, is pretty much on the level. 
But that’s not the important question. What matters is how corrupt do you  think  your government is. And on that score, the news is bad. 
In our most recent Fox News  poll , we asked respondents “How many people in the government do you think are corrupt -- almost all, many, some, or almost none?” The results should be sobering for everyone concerned about the current trajectory of politics. 
About one in five said that almost all of the people in government are corrupt. An amazing 43 percent said that “many” are crooked. Just 31 percent got closer to reality saying that “some” in the government are corrupt. A sad 2 percent said “almost none.” 
As with all reputational goods, like a nation’s currency, the perception of value is far more important than the actual value itself. If a government is perceived as corrupt it’s almost as bad as the real thing, and will eventually result in real corruption anyway. 
If you think the game is rigged, you’re far more likely to be willing to cheat yourself. 
The 64 percent of Americans who believe their government is rotten with corruption don’t belong to any particular demographic or political group, either. Women are a little more distrustful than men and white people are more dubious than other ethnic groups, whites without college degrees most of all. 
But religious faith, political proclivities, education and income all had relatively little bearing on the overall perception that corruption is a major problem in our government. 
It’s no wonder, given what both political parties are selling these days. It would be one thing if the response was really about “draining the swamp” and some sustained effort for reforms that might bring public perception back into alignment with reality. But what tends to happen is that politicians exploit such perceptions to create lower expectations for good government and accountability once they are in power. 
If the whole system is rigged, why should our side have to play by the rules? After all  they’re  the real crooks  
That’s how the false perception of rampant corruption makes way for the real thing. THE RULEBOOK: THERE’S A DIFFERENCE 
“It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.” –  James Madison ,  Federalist No. 14 TIME OUT: SOUNDS LIKE AMERICA Gun&Garden:  “When  Ken Burns  decides to cover a topic, set aside some time to dig in. Best known for his epics, including his  Civil War  documentary, which aired on PBS over five nights in 1990 to an audience of 40 million people, the filmmaker is now readying for the premiere his latest deep-dive,  Country Music . The eight-part, sixteen-hour film takes a magnifying glass to the forces that shaped this distinctly American sound. ‘I’m looking for stories, and I’m looking for stories that are firing on all cylinders,’ Burns tells  Garden & Gun . … The film runs chronologically, tracing the many influences that shaped country music, from enslaved people bringing the banjo across the Atlantic from Africa all the way to the heyday of pop-country in the mid-1990s. The genre, Burns reveals, is less a set of rules and boundaries than it is a spectrum—one that trades on universal truths and bridges cultural, racial, and economic divides.” Flag on the play? -  Email us at  HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM  with your tips, comments or questions.

BIDEN RACKS UP KEY ENDORSEMENTS AP:  “ Joe Biden  sought to demonstrate a broad appeal to Democrats on Thursday with new endorsements from leading African American lawmakers and a former governor of a pivotal swing state. The backing from Reps.  G.K. Butterfield  of North Carolina,  Emanuel Cleaver  of Missouri and  Charlie Crist  of Florida reflects Biden’s play both for the party establishment and for minority voters who are critical in the early stages of the primary. Butterfield and Cleaver are former chairmen of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Crist was the governor of Florida before he entered Congress. The moves are the latest example of Biden’s durability as an early Democratic front-runner. So far, he’s successfully threaded different wings of the party despite skepticism from progressives and questions about whether, at 76, he’s too old for the presidency. … [T]he support of Butterfield and Cleaver in particular is a potential blow to Sen.  Kamala Harris  [and] Sen.  Cory Booker …” Younger black voters try to pry their parents from Biden -  NYT:  “If Mr. Biden, 76, is going to win the Democratic nomination, it is likely to be because of the support of older black voters… But if he is to be overtaken by one of his more progressive rivals, the most powerful tool against him may not be opposition research or negative advertisements. Instead, it may be an organic effort by younger black voters — concerned about Mr. Biden’s age and more moderate ideology — to sway their older family members. Mr. Biden seems aware of this dynamic. In interviews, he has both acknowledged the generational gap among his black supporters and downplayed its importance, arguing that the support of older, more moderate black voters would be enough to give him an electoral advantage. Still, Mr. Biden, by his own admission, would be unwise to underestimate the lobbying efforts of those who are young and politically engaged.” Harris takes aim at Warren -  WSJ:  “Ka­mala Har­ris, now a dis­tant fourth in the De­mo­c­ra­tic pres­i­den­tial race, took aim at poll-climber  Eliz­a­beth War­ren  for do­ing big-money events. In re­sponse to a ques­tion about War­ren, Har­ris said at a closed-door fundraiser it was hyp­o­crit­i­cal for her ri­val to claim she wasn’t tak­ing money from large donors when War­ren trans­ferred around $10 mil­lion from her Sen­ate funds be­fore de­nounc­ing big money do­na­tions. Har­ris moved $1.2 mil­lion into her pres­i­den­tial fund. Har­ris lamented that she now needs to be in places like New York to keep the cam­paign fi­nan­cially afloat but prefers to spend time in early vot­ing states. On a later press call, Har­ris’s cam­paign didn’t name War­ren di­rectly but noted re­peat­edly that Har­ris came into the cam­paign with less than other can­di­dates be­cause ‘we spent 2018 rais­ing for other can­di­dates.’” And same with Buttigieg -   AP:  “Democratic presidential candidate  Pete Buttigieg  is accusing his 2020 rival Elizabeth Warren of being ‘extremely evasive’ when it comes to explaining how she'd finance a universal health care plan. Speaking on CNN on Thursday, Buttigieg issued his most pointed attack yet on the Massachusetts senator, saying she ‘was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we've seen that repeatedly.’ The sharpened critique comes as the fall campaign kicks into high gear with Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses scheduled in February. Warren has assembled a well-organized campaign there and leads Buttigieg in Iowa, where the South Bend, Indiana, mayor's longshot presidential campaign is competing heavily and trying to break through.” Yang plays Perot for a new generation -   Atlantic:  “To understand why [ Andrew Yang  is hanging on in the polls], it’s worth looking at how he responded earlier this month when  Shane Gillis , a comedian for Saturday Night Live, referred to him using a racial slur. Yang urged that Gillis not be fired. … But more revealing was Yang’s explanation for why Gillis deserved forgiveness. Gillis, Yang tweeted, ‘does not strike me as malignant or evil. He strikes me as a still-forming comedian from central Pennsylvania.’ What does central Pennsylvania have to do with it? For Andrew Yang and his supporters, everything. It’s code for economic distress—which Yang believes fuels racism and most of the other problems that menace America. … Over the past quarter century, two presidential candidates have mobilized these economics-first, culture-war-indifferent voters into a potent force. The first was  Ross Perot . The second is Andrew Yang.” De Blasiout -   Fox News:  “New York Mayor  Bill de Blasio  announced Friday he is dropping out of the 2020 Democratic primary, ending his campaign after struggling to gain traction in the race. ‘I feel like I contributed all I can to this primary election and it’s clearly not my time,’ he said during an appearance on MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe.’ ‘So I’m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City and I’m going to keep speaking up for working people.’ De Blasio entered the presidential race in May, running as a proud progressive. But his campaign never caught fire: He qualified for the first two rounds of Democratic presidential debates but has failed to make the cut for the others.” Booker hides from past alliance with DeVos -   WaPo:  “Cory Booker was a little-known member of the Newark City Council 19 years ago when he received an extraordinary invitation from a Michigan group connected to  Betsy DeVos , now the U.S. Secretary of Education. DeVos and her husband,  Dick , were leading Republican proponents of a state ballot initiative that would allow taxpayer-financed vouchers to pay for private schools. … Booker accepted. … But as Booker runs for president, his relationship with DeVos, his previous support of vouchers and his continuing praise for charter schools present potential roadblocks. Vouchers and charters schools are anathema to many powerful teachers unions, who have outsize power in Democratic primaries, and some candidates in the party strongly oppose them on the grounds that they weaken traditional public schools.” UKRAINE AT CENTER OF FIGHT OVER ALLEGED TRUMP PROMISE Fox News:  “The developing controversy over a mysterious phone conversation  President Trump  had with a foreign leader apparently centers on Ukraine, as the president and his allies fight back and claim the uproar is just another ‘partisan’ plot against him. What touched off the controversy is a secret whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ‘promise’ Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. Trump's attorney,  Rudy Giuliani , seemed to acknowledge some effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate potential corruption related to the Biden family, though he gave conflicting answers on the matter in a CNN interview overnight. It remains unclear what the supposed ‘promise’ from Trump entailed. The president, however, maintained he said nothing improper, tearing into those pushing the allegations Friday.” Giuliani inconsistent -  WaPo:  “Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, contradicted himself when asked whether he personally asked Ukraine to investigate former vice president  Joe Biden , ranted about media bias and defended Trump amid new reports about an intelligence official’s whistleblower complaint, during a chaotic and fiery CNN interview Thursday night. Immediately after anchor  Chris Cuomo  introduced him and summarized the latest news out of the whistleblower story, which had only broken about an hour prior, Giuliani went into attack mode. … Giuliani spent the first half of the interview repeating the claim that Biden in 2016 pressured Ukraine to drop its top prosecutor, which at the time was also investigating a natural gas company where Biden’s son  Hunter  was on the board. …There’s been no evidence found that Biden was trying to help out his son.” TRUMP RALLIES WITH MODI IN OUTREACH TO KEY VOTER BLOC WaPo:  “President Trump heads to Harris County, Texas this weekend to a major rally ahead of next week's United Nations General Assembly — for Indian Prime Minister  Narendra Modi . The website for the ‘Howdy, Modi’ rally boasts that the ‘live audience will be the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader visiting the United States other than the Pope’: Some 50,000 people, many from Houston's large Indian diaspora, are expected to turn out. It's eye-popping that leaders of the world's two biggest democracies are appearing together at such an event — let alone that this particular American president will be holding court in the epicenter of Texas's blue wave and the most diverse city in America. You're not wrong if you think that doesn't sound like friendly territory for Trump. But that's a strong political reason for him to go: Democrats are making a big play for Texas in 2020 and Republicans are growing concerned. The rally for Modi, who is hugely popular in India, provides Trump with access to a potential pool of Indian American voters that could turn out to be critical in next year's presidential elections.” SENATE DEMS NEED BIG WINS IN THE SUN BELT Politico:  “To take back the White House, Democrats only need to win back three key Rust Belt states. But if they want to move a president’s agenda through the Senate, they have to flip the Sun Belt. From Arizona to North Carolina to a pair of seats in Georgia, Democrats have to clean up in that stretch of the country to have any chance of taking the chamber. President Donald Trump carried each of those states in 2016, and in an era of polarized politics when Senate races are increasingly nationalized, Democrats need at least strong performances by the party's presidential nominee in the Sun Belt states — if not victories — to have a shot at flipping their Senate seats. So while some Democrats are laser-focused on winning back the Rust Belt, Democrats across the Southern half of the country are urging their party to invest heavily in their states — not just as a way to flip the Senate, but as part of the path to 270 Electoral College votes.” Kemp frustrates GOP with cattle call for Senate appointment -   AJC:  “Within hours of Gov.  Brian Kemp ’s unusual decision to invite the public to apply to succeed U.S. Sen.  Johnny Isakson , his office was blitzed with resumes — some serious and some silly — from wannabe Washingtonians.Lawyers. Doctors. Local government officials. Serial jokesters. IT specialists. A well-known pundit. As of Wednesday evening, 158 people had applied — and many, many more are expected to join in. … Welcome to the next phase of the race for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Chances are, Kemp and his advisers already have whittled a list of top contenders for Isakson’s seat down to a handful — and that the online application process unveiled late Tuesday will be largely for show. But encouraging would-be U.S. senators to publicly declare their ambition might just expand the scope of his search even as it forces some tough decisions on potential contenders.” PLAY-BY-PLAY Fox Poll: Voters are frustrated with government, nervous about economy   -  Fox News Trump files lawsuit in bid to protect personal, corporate tax returns from release  -  Fox News McConnell flips stance, announces support for $250 million in election security funding  -  WaPo Sanders becomes first Dem candidate to hit one million donors  -  Politico AUDIBLE: IOWA NICE?

"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — College students are back on campus.  Bernie Sanders  is, too. Earlier this month at Iowa State University, he lectured to young voters as they played “Green New Deal Pong” (the  Solo cups  were filled with green-colored water) and “Bern Bag Toss.”  At the University of Nevada, Reno,  he croaked through a hoarse voice to address a crowd that stretched from the college lawn to the open-air floors of a  parking garage beside it. And at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Thursday evening, he implored students to get themselves to the primary polls come February — and vote for him. “You have friends out there, and I know you do, who think that the political system” is absurd, he said, using a colorful expletive. “Tell them that instead of just complaining, they must get involved into the political process.” It was a sentiment he has repeated often this month as he crisscrossed the country on what has amounted to a whirlwind back-to-school tour. In Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina, he has by turns used flattery (“Your generation is the most progressive younger generation in the history of this country”) and subtle warnings (“The future of this country and in fact the world rests with your generation”) to bolster his appeals. Everywhere, his goal was the same: muster a version of the army of young voters who propelled his campaign in 2016. His message was one that has resonated with Brianna Williams, 19, who arrived with a group of friends to hear him in Chapel Hill .  “I’ve seen a lot of his policies, and I’m just excited for what he has to offer as a candidate,” she said. But she was just as excited by Senator Elizabeth Warren. “I would love to see a woman running the country,” she said. “That would be really cool.” Last time around, Mr. Sanders’s rants against the elite and promises of free college tuition endeared him to legions of young fans. It also helped that Mr. Sanders —  74  at the time, with unruly white hair and an old-school Brooklyn accent — was both decidedly uncool and new to presidential politics, affording his campaign a paradoxical edge that inspired millions of young supporters to “feel the bern” and vote for him over Hillary Clinton.  As he fights anew for the Democratic nomination, it is not lost on him or his allies that his success hinges, in no small part, on his ability to capture that enthusiasm again —  for both the optics of his race and the actual votes.   But this time he is no longer an insurgent, nor is he the only anti-establishment candidate in the race — factors that helped boost his standing among young voters. With the race entering the crucial fall period, other candidates, including Ms. Warren and Andrew Yang, have begun siphoning off some of his support. [ Sign up for our politics newsletter  hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race. ] Even Mr. Sanders’s closest advisers acknowledge that he cannot take for granted a voting cohort they view as critical, even if it is traditionally unreliable in actually making it to the ballot box. “Last time it was much more organic,” Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, said. “And this time it’s far more intentional.” In interviews, many young voters still praised Mr. Sanders, sometimes breathlessly — citing his authenticity and conviction but also his calls for free college and universal health care and his proposal to cancel student debt. But many also expressed curiosity, if not exuberance, about other candidates  “I love everything he stands for,” said Asha Loutsch, 18, as she sat with a circle of friends who were waiting for his event at the University of Iowa. “I think he really cares about what he’s trying to say. Like, he’s always getting up in there, you know?” But she also said she was interested in Ms. Warren and wanted to hear her speak. Jiego Lim, an 18-year-old student at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was volunteering at Mr. Sanders’s event there, said he supported Mr. Sanders but was also intrigued by Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris. “I feel like we need a fresh new face in politics,” he said. “Bernie comes off aggressive to me sometimes.” Others were less equivocal.  “He’s America’s dad,” offered Gabriel Olier, 19, a student in Reno. “I love Bernie.” That affection for Mr. Sanders is reflected in some more tangible metrics. His campaign said it had so far raised over $1 million from people under the age of 25, a relatively small figure compared to his overall haul but one that nevertheless points to his continued strength with young voters. [ Here’s the latest data  on who’s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] And in most polls, Mr. Sanders still maintains a strong lead among young voters:  A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey  showed that a third of voters under 35 supported him. Yet at the same time, a quarter of these respondents said they supported Ms. Warren , suggesting Mr. Sanders no longer has the same hold on the group he had in 2016. Any candidate relying on the support of younger voters faces an undeniable challenge: Younger voters tend not to vote in high numbers compared with other groups. In the 2016 election, for instance, only  11 percent of voters  under 30 participated in the Iowa caucuses, representing just 15 percent of the total, according to an estimate from the  Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and  Engagement   at Tufts University. But the high turnout among young voters during the 2018 midterm elections has given some experts hope that the 2020 election will be different. That strong showing has provided organizers with a larger pool to identify and target potential presidential voters. Issues, including climate change, criminal justice, health care and gun control, are also motivating young voters to act. “The truth is that if younger people in this country voted at the same level as people 65 and over, we could transform this country,” Mr. Sanders said this month at the University of Iowa. “Please do it!” John Della Volpe , the director of polling at Harvard’s  Institute of Politics , said that Mr. Sanders was still “doing really well” but that the field was more complex and his pool of support was smaller. “At this stage, he’s essentially sharing support of young people in most polls with Elizabeth Warren,” Mr. Della Volpe said. “The idea of going after structural reforms is really, I think, what is resonating so clearly with young people.” Indeed, of all the other candidates, it is Ms. Warren who appears to be generating the most powerful wave of energy among young voters in Democratic presidential politics — particularly among those who once supported Mr. Sanders. Olivia Stecklein, 19, a student at the University of Iowa, said she had been a fan of Mr. Sanders since 2015 but was now choosing between him and Ms. Warren. “I feel like they’re pretty similar, but I just kind of like how Elizabeth Warren has a set-out plan for everything,” she said. “She just seems very prepared.” Eliza Link, 18, a University of Iowa student, said she was also deciding between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. “I think they’re both the cool aunt and uncle of the political race right now,” she said. With his characteristic verve that can exhaust even young reporters, Mr. Sanders has been in an all-out sprint to earn the vote of the youths, months before any of them can even cast their vote.  His team set up a Bernie Summer School program to train campus leaders in the art of campaigning. He urged his campaign to get him back on college campuses in the first weeks of the new school year. He constantly asks his team to share data on young voters. To win over the group, however, Mr. Sanders will have to convince people like Tim Watts, 19. Before Mr. Sanders’s event in Reno, Mr. Watts wore a “MATH” hat, the universal accessory of Yang supporters. But despite his overt support for Mr. Yang — who in some ways is benefiting from the outsider status among young voters that Mr. Sanders enjoyed in 2016 — Mr. Watts said he had not yet closed the door on Mr. Sanders. “I’m part of the Yang gang, I guess,” he said. “I will probably feel the bern later.” Rachel Shorey contributed reporting from Washington."
"But in a back-and-forth with reporters, he did not deny discussing former Vice President Joe Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call -- a potential subject for the complaint.  And he admitted he did not know the whistleblower's identity, despite his accusation of partisanship. It was a robust self-defense against accusations that remain, for now, veiled in mystery. An intelligence watchdog has said the claims are ""urgent"" and ""serious,"" but the acting top intelligence official has declined to provide them to Congress. Trump dismissed them as another attempt to bring down his presidency. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump called the story ""ridiculous"" and described the whistleblower as ""just another political hack job.""  ""It's a partisan whistleblower. They shouldn't even have information. I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate,"" Trump said alongside his Australian counterpart, who he was hosting for a state visit. Asked whether he'd discussed Biden with Ukraine's Zelensky during a phone call in late July, Trump said it ""doesn't matter what I discussed,"" but insisted that someone should look into Biden. ""It was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor's taken off the case,"" Trump said, appearing to refer to January remarks when Biden discussed his interactions with Ukraine's leadership when serving as vice president. ""The fake news,"" Trump claimed,""doesn't look into things like that."" Trump's remarks came a day after the New York Times and Washington Post reported that an intelligence whistleblower had submitted a complaint related to Trump's interactions on Ukraine. Precise details of the accusation aren't known, much to the chagrin of Democratic lawmakers, who have demanded more information. Trump admitted Friday he did not know the whistleblower's identity, and said he wasn't even sure if it was his conversation with Ukraine's leader that was the topic of the complaint. But he nevertheless appeared defensive about his interactions with Zelensky, whom he will meet next week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Appearing in a rambling interview on CNN on Thursday evening, the President's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani admitted he himself had discussed Biden with Ukraine's leaders during a visit to the country. That conversation has come under scrutiny from House investigators, who have demanded more information about Trump and Giuliani's interactions regarding Ukraine and the Biden matter. That includes a transcript of Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president. Democrats are also looking for more information about the whistleblower's complaint. ""There's a real sense of urgency here since the Inspector General was so clear this is not something that can wait,"" said House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff on Friday, a day after his panel was briefed behind closed doors by the inspector general."
"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com President Trump  remains scheduled to meet with his  Ukraine  counterpart at the  United Nations  General Assembly in New York next week despite a media frenzy unleashed by Friday's report that a whistleblower complained about a “promise” the U.S. president allegedly made to the foreign leader in a July phone call.  The U.N.'s  official schedule  says Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and 16 other world leaders will attend a General Assembly meeting Tuesday. NBC News White House correspondent Kelly O’Donnell tweeted Friday that the White House confirmed Trump will meet with Zelensky on Wednesday.  It wasn't immediately clear if the second gathering would be a one-on-one meeting. NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT Zelensky will also take meetings with leaders of the Ukrainian community in the U.S., leaders of Jewish organizations based in the U.S. and representatives of the American business community, O’Donnell reported. He will also attend the Sustainable Development Summit.  A senior White House official told Axios that Trump will meet with Zelensky to congratulate him on his victory in the eastern European nation’s recent presidential election and his “energy and success"" in battling corruption. The official said Trump will also voice ""his concerns about predatory Chinese economic activity in Ukraine."" Trump’s itinerary also says he’ll meet with the leaders of Pakistan, Poland, New Zealand, Singapore, Egypt, South Korea, the U.K., India, Iraq and El Salvador, Axios reported.  Trump will also host a summit Monday on religious freedom. His speech will present the U.S. as an alternative to authoritarianism and underline his ""commitment to upholding democracy and protecting religious freedom,"" administration officials said Friday during a briefing call, according to  Axios . Trump will not attend a U.N. meeting that same day that’s slated to focus on climate change.  A secret whistleblower filed a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, on Aug. 12, detailing a ""promise"" Trump reportedly made to an unnamed foreign leader. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire so far has withheld the complaint from Congress. The Washington Post and the New York Times both reported Thursday that  the complaint involved Ukraine. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to work with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe into Hunter Biden. The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Trump called the whistleblower a partisan and dismissed the allegation as “another political hack job,” while Democrats in Congress accused the president of trying to intimidate whistleblowers and demanded the administration hand over the complaint and a transcript of the call. 2020 hopefuls used the controversy as a chance to renew calls for impeachment. Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has faced scrutiny for months over his past role allegedly pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to his son Hunter Biden. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation. Fox News’ Adam Shaw and Alex Pappas contributed to this report."
"Top conservative blogger Matt Drudge says the Democratic presidential nomination is Elizabeth Warren's to lose; reaction on 'The Five.' A Wall Street executive made a gloomy prediction on Thursday about a potential  Elizabeth Warren  presidency, suggesting that the stock market ""won't open"" if she was sworn into office. Omega Advisors CEO Leon Cooperman appeared on CNBC to express his concerns and shared his predictions on what would happen if the Massachusetts senator was elected. ""There’s unquestionably a shift to the left in this country. They won’t open the stock market if Elizabeth Warren is the next president,"" Cooperman claimed. He later explained his rationale; “When I said they wouldn’t open the market if Elizabeth Warren won, my way of just saying the market would be very vulnerable.” WARREN GETS STUMPED BY COLBERT WHEN PRESSED ON MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES TO FUND MEDICARE-FOR-ALL When asked what will happen to the stock market if Warren clinches the Democratic nomination, Cooperman predicted that the market will be ""lower"" if she or her progressive colleague, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, becomes a ""credible opponent"" to President Trump, citing a potential ""25 percent"" dip in the market. ""Her policies are counterproductive, they're negative for capitalism, and the capitalism is what brought America to the position that we're in today,"" Cooperman added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Democratic 2020 hopeful offered a response to Cooperman on Twitter. ""Our economy works great for people who can use their money and power to become even richer and more powerful,"" Warren wrote. ""But I've got a plan to ensure it works for everyone else too. If that scares hedge fund billionaires like this guy, fine by me."""
"Klopfer died on September 3 and his family  was going through his belongings at his home  in Will County, about 45 miles from Chicago, when they found the medically preserved remains, authorities said. They were inside small, sealed plastic bags that contained a chemical used to preserve biological material, Will County Sheriff Mike Kelley told reporters at a news conference Thursday. They were in boxes that were mixed in with other storage boxes  ""I can tell you, the 31 years I've been doing this job, I have never seen anything like this, ever. It is a strange, one of those once-in-a-lifetime things,"" he said.  Klopfer operated three abortion clinics in South Bend, Indiana, before his license was suspended in 2015. County officials estimated how long the remains had been preserved but did not provide details on how they determined they were from nearly two decades ago. ""The condition they are in, it is clear that they are older,"" said James Glasgow, Will County state's attorney.  Klopfer did not follow Indiana law for disposal of the fetal remains and the filing of the proper paperwork, Glasgow said. The remains will be transferred to the custody of the Indiana attorney general.  An attorney representing the doctor's family called the Will County coroner's office on September 12 to inform them the family had discovered what appeared to be the remains of fetuses and asked for assistance in removing them, the Will County Sheriff's Office said. Detectives arrived at the address and the coroner's office took the remains. The family is cooperating with the investigation.  There is no evidence any medical procedures were conducted at the doctor's property, according to the sheriff's office.  Anti-abortion groups have gathered at the site of his former clinics to demand the identification and burial of the remains,  CNN affiliate WNDU reported.  One woman  told WNDU  that she was raped as a minor and had an abortion at one of Klopfer's clinics. ""For me, closure would be just know if my baby was on his property so that I can just have a proper burial,"" Serena Dyksen said.  South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, called for an investigation. ""Like everyone, I find the news out of Illinois extremely disturbing, and I think it's important that it be fully investigated,"" Buttigieg  said Wednesday . ""I also hope it doesn't get caught up in politics at a time when women need access to health care. There's no question that what happened is disturbing. It's unacceptable. And it needs to be looked into fully."""

"Here's what else you need to know to  Get Up to Speed and Out the Door . (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily.  Sign up here .) 1. Whistleblower scandal OK, this story is really complicated, so let's just start at the beginning. A whistleblower inside the intelligence community filed a complaint about communications between President Trump and a foreign leader. The whistleblower was alarmed by a ""promise"" Trump allegedly made to the foreign leader. The Democratically led House Intelligence Committee wants to see the complaint, but Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence, has blocked that. (He's set to testify before the committee next week.) The White House and Justice Department told the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  not to share the complaint  because they don't believe it's governed by laws covering intelligence whistleblowers, three sources told CNN. Then, yesterday the  Washington Post  and  New York Times  reported that the communications at the center of all this involved Ukraine. Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by phone in July. Some Trump supporters have  pushed for the Ukrainian government to open investigations  that the President could use to raise suspicions about his political rivals, including Joe Biden. Some observers wonder if there's a connection between the push for an investigation and Trump's call with Zelensky. But there's no public evidence that the whistleblower's complaint pertains to the Trump-Zelensky call. The potential ramifications of this story are starting to become more clear, CNN political analyst Stephen Collinson says, and the  risks facing the President, the intelligence community and Democrats  in Congress are climbing by the day.  Here are 5 key questions  about the whistleblower case. 2. Justin Trudeau Another day, another apology from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. After a  third incident emerged  of him  wearing brownface or blackface , he was forced to meet with reporters for the second day in a row to say he's sorry for wearing racist makeup. He also flat out said he doesn't remember how many times he's worn blackface. Trudeau, known for his uber-progressive views, insists he's still an ally in the fight for social justice. But this scandal  and other recent political hiccups  could mix to seriously threaten his chances at re-election next month. 3. Israel It's been three days since votes were cast in Israel's elections, and we  still don't know who will be leading the country . Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White party, declared victory because his party is projected to win a few more seats in Israel's legislature than Likud, the political party headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But Gantz won't have enough seats to govern. He'd probably have to form a coalition with Netanyahu to do that, and that's probably not going to happen. So, that brings up another possibility: Israel may have to have a third election to settle the political gridlock. 4. Weather The remnants of Tropical Storm Imelda are  pushing into northern Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana  today, dumping heavy rain along the way. The storm left quite the mess in southeast Texas, where some areas got more than 30 inches of rain. Flooding was so bad in Houston that  hundreds of cars were abandoned  after rising water made some roads impassable. Meanwhile, out in the Atlantic,  Hurricane Jerry has developed . It's a Category 1 storm right now and is expected to pass just north of the Leeward Islands today before moving north of Puerto Rico and the Bahamas over the weekend. 5. Climate strike If your co-worker or classmate isn't around today, it may not be because they're getting an early jump on the weekend. They could be on strike. Global climate strikes are taking place today all over the world, with people walking out of workplaces and classrooms  to demand action to address the climate crisis . It's expected to be the biggest day of climate demonstrations in history. More than  100,000 people gathered in Melbourne , Australia. Some  workers from Amazon  and Microsoft are walking off the job. Some  companies are actually supporting  their employees' participation in the strike. New York City gave 1.1 million students the OK to skip school for it.  Click here to keep up  with the latest.

"NYC Councilman Joe Borelli, Democratic strategist Jessica Tarlov and FOX Nation host Kat Timpf weigh in on Joe Biden and President Trump's back and forth over Biden's dealings with Ukraine. A top  Ukrainian  official on Saturday defended  President Trump's  July phone call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during which Trump reportedly urged authorities in Kiev to investigate dealings in the Eastern European county by the son of former Vice President  Joe Biden . “I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,” Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko  told the Hromadske media outlet . ""There was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers."" Zelenskiy's office has not commented on the allegations. Trump and Zelenskiy are expected to meet in person at the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump had repeatedly asked Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden, who had ties to a natural gas firm that was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor as part of a corruption probe. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has suggested that Joe Biden, the current frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, worked while he was vice president to protect his son's company from being investigated. ""President Trump is interested, his advisor, Giuliani, newspapers, Democrats, Republicans are interested in whether pressure had been put on Ukraine,"" Prystaiko said during the same interview. ""I want to say that we are an independent state, we have our own secrets."" BIDEN FACES SCRUTINY FOR DEMANDING OUSTER OF UKRAINE OFFICIAL PROBING FIRM THAT EMPLOYED HIS SON Biden on Saturday denied he has ever spoken to Hunter about his business in Ukraine and called President Trump's actions an ""overwhelming abuse of power."" “Trump’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum, and he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,” Biden  told reporters in Iowa  on Saturday. NEW DETAILS ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT President Trump earlier on Saturday tweeted about the ""Ukraine Witch Hunt,"" which he says is a last-ditch effort by the ""Fake News Media"" to protect Biden. ""Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone 'bust' on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden,"" Trump said. ""Will fail again!"" The Fake News Media didn't want to report that ""Joe Biden [demanded] that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won’t get a very large amount of U.S. money,"" the president had said. ""[So] they fabricate a [...] story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine. Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster,"" Trump said. Giuliani also chimed in on Saturday morning, tweeting: ""Biden’s defense is, not I didn’t do it, but 'no media outlet gives any credibility to the story.' Of course they don’t. Swamp Media been covering up Biden Family blatant trading on Joe’s offices for years. Joe is part of the protected class. Why would they start now?"" Trump's call with Zelenskiy is reportedly what sparked a whistleblower complaint that a ranking House Democrat says is being purposely withheld from Congress possibly to protect the White House.

"New revelations, and now a previously-unseen interview, raising questions over former Vice President Joe  Biden's  account of his handling of Anita  Hill's  1991 sexual harassment allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence  Thomas . Biden chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation hearing of Thomas and the committee heard testimony from Thomas and Hill.  Biden has repeatedly  claimed  that he believed Hill from the very beginning and that he did everything in his power to keep Thomas from being confirmed. 'SPECIAL INTERESTS' WANTS TO TARNISH KAVANAUGH, AS THEY DID THOMAS: CLARENCE THOMAS ADVISER However, Biden's account is challenged in the Fox Nation documentary  'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching '  and now Fox Nation is releasing previously-unseen interviews elaborating on these claims. In  'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching ',  former Senator Orrin Hatch R-Utah, who sat on the 1991 Judiciary committee with Biden, told Fox Nation that Biden told him during the hearings that he 'didn’t believe [Hill].'"" Longtime Thomas adviser and radio host, Armstrong Williams told Fox Nation that ""Biden assured [Thomas], repeatedly on the phone and in person, 'Clarence, you will be confirmed.'"" Now, in new interview material, Williams said ""Joe Biden wanted to vote for Thomas – remember.  Joe Biden is getting grief right now because [of the way] they say he treated Anita Hill...by and large, the Southern Senators and Biden liked Thomas."" Thomas' nomination was eventually confirmed by a narrow majority of 52 to 48.  Biden voted against sending Thomas to the Supreme Court. “Biden was always confidentially talking to Thomas saying ‘I’m with you. I’m with you.’  That’s something that people don’t know.  Biden was very much encouraging him, behind the scenes. Telling him to hang in there...Behind the scenes, no one could have been more gracious than Biden,"" Williams continued. WOULD IT GO VIRAL TODAY? EXPLOSIVE TESTIMONY IN THOMAS/HILL SAGA: NEW DOC Biden's handling of the hearings has long been a point of contention for his critics, who fault Biden for not allowing more witnesses, supportive of Hill, to testify. In March, Biden  lamented  his apparent inability to provide a different forum for Hill to air her allegations. ""To this day I regret I couldn't come up with a way to give her the kind of hearing she deserved,"" Biden said at a New York City event honoring young people who helped combat sexual assault on college campuses. ""I wish I could have done something."" According to Williams, Biden pro-actively prevented witnesses from making allegations that Biden deemed unfounded. ""Well, there were people that wanted to testify, who had no credibility, that the other side was pushing for -- Biden never allowed them on the docket."" FLASHBACK: KAVANAUGH'S WIFE RESPONDS TO SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HER HUSBAND “I have a lot of respect for Biden. I've always found Biden to be fair, compassionate and really could read the tea leaves of where things are going, because he did let [Thomas and me] know 'This is not going well.  But I am not going to allow what is garbage and unproven accusations...to make it into this hearing'.  I mean – there were his colleagues, who were angry with him about it, but Biden was a stand-up kind of guy. I know conservatives are not going to like it, but as far as I'm concerned Biden was always decent,"" said Williams. Williams also acknowledged that his account may not be politically-advantageous to Biden. “I had no issue with Biden during that process.  Biden did all he could – this may not help him on-camera – Biden did all he could to be fair to Judge Thomas at the time.  He could not have been more gracious and more communicative with the Justice at the time, and he apologized profusely.  He felt so bad [about] what was happening to him and these allegations.” 'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching'  is available exclusively on  Fox Nation.

"Fox Nation hosts Diamond &amp; Silk come to President Trump's defense on 'Fox &amp; Friends.' Fox Nation's   Diamond & Silk  weighed in on former NBA player  Charles Barkley  slamming  Democrats'  for their lack of action in the black community and accusing them of taking the black vote for granted. ""Let me just tell you this here, when it comes to Democrats listening, they promise on everything and they deliver on nothing,"" said Diamond on  ""Fox & Friends."" TRUMP TOUTS HISTORICALLY LOW LEVEL OF AFRICAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT Diamond also blasted some Democrats for pushing for reparations for African-Americans, which has recently become a talking point amongst 2020 Democrats. ""Look at how they're promising reparations, black people don't need reparations, they need liberation from the Democrat party,"" Diamond said. The duo agreed largely with Barkley, who went after Democrats for allegedly only paying attention to black voters around election time. CHARLES BARKLEY JOKES ABOUT JUSSIE SMOLLETT, LIAM NEESON CONTROVERSIES DURING TNT'S NBA HALFTIME SHOW ""They’ve been taking black people’s votes – and they only talk to black people every four years. All of these politicians only talk to black people every four years because they want their vote,"" Barkley  said  in an interview aired Wednesday. He added that he thought Republicans didn't talk to black voters and that Democrats did ""nothing in the four years in between."" ""Fox & Friends"" host Brian Kilmeade agreed with Barkley, and called on Republicans to further their efforts in the black community, but Diamond and Silk pointed to President Trump's actions in response. ""When it comes to the Republican party, we have a Republican president. He's not all talk, he takes action,"" Diamond said, referencing the  historically low black unemployment rate  and Trump's commitment to the  First Step Act. ""So...Republicans don't have to pander, because they deliver...our Republican president...is delivering,"" she continued. Silk said she hoped black people would have a ""come to Jesus moment"" and that they would ""realize that the Democrat party mean black people no good."" Reiterating Diamond's support for Trump, Silk said the president is helping the black community by ""leading by example."" ""The president is doing what he needs to do when it comes down to black people by showing people this is what you need for the black community."" ""You need jobs so you can take care of your family,"" Silk continued, ""instead of talking about it, he's 'being about it,'  and that's why black people are waking up to it.""

"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass.,  announced Saturday that he will mount a primary challenge to  Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass ., next year. The 38-year-old Kennedy -- the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy – formally announced his candidacy at a community center in Boston after weeks of rumors that he was mulling entering the race. AOC ENDORSES ED MARKEY, GREEN NEW DEAL CO-SPONSOR AHEAD OF POSSIBLE SENATE PRIMARY ""Donald Trump has forced a long overdue reckoning in America, and how we respond will say everything about who we are,"" Kennedy told supporters. ""We have to take on the broken system that gave rise to him in the first place — the outdated structures and old rules, the everyday oppressions and injustices that hold our people back.""

       Should Kennedy win, he would be the fourth Kennedy to serve in the Senate, joining his grandfather and his great-uncles John F. Kennedy, the 35th president, and Edward Kennedy. Edward Kennedy was the last member of the prestigious political family to run for Senate, winning election in 1962. The challenge to Markey, 73, is likely to leave local Democrats, including 2020 presidential hopeful and fellow Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., with a difficult choice of who to back. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,  has already endorsed Markey, with whom she has worked closely on the  Green New Deal  resolution introduced in Congress earlier this year. ""Ed Markey is a proud and strong progressive champion for working families -- not just in Massachusetts but across the country,"" she said last week.

       Markey, who joined thousands of young climate change activists who rallied in Boston on Friday as part of a global, youth-led day of environmental action, has the backing of many environmental activists. One of those groups — Environment Massachusetts — has vowed to raise $5 million to help Markey win re-election. Kennedy positioned himself as a more pragmatic Democrat when he was first elected to Congress in 2012, but has since adopted a series of left-wing stances. He has backed impeachment proceedings against President Trump, ""Medicare-for-all"" and the Green New Deal. In 2018, Kennedy gave the Democratic response to Trump's State of the Union address. Despite the blue-on-blue challenge, Kennedy has not yet moved to criticize Markey. ""Senator Markey is a good man,"" he said. ""This is going to be a tough race."" But Markey responded on Saturday by challenging Kennedy, along with other primary opponents, to a debate on how to respond to the question of climate change -- an issue he has been advocating on for decades. He proposed it be held in November. ""I was very disappointed at the Democratic National Committee's refusal to hold a debate on climate change for our presidential candidates,"" Markey said in a video message. ""So today I'm challenging Congressman Joe Kennedy, Shannon Liss-Riordan and Steve Pemberton to a climate change debate, and to do it very soon."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “For the next generation, we can’t wait,” he said. Liss-Riordan, a workers' rights lawyer, and Pemberton, a former senior executive at Walgreens, are also challenging Markey. The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"The genius of Barack Obama lay in the fact that Americans looked at him and could believe in almost anything. The left of the Democratic Party saw the revolutionary incarnation of hope, the promise of sweeping social change, and, in a black president, the overturning of America’s original sin. The center saw a measured  product of Harvard Law School,  a prudent reformer, a man of mixed identity and the middle ground.  Moderates were closer to the mark. Obama, a cool man, proved cautious to a fault. Still, the way he  cloaked  his coolness and masked his aloofness in the language of the heart was brilliant. This time around, there is no such political genius out there among the Democratic contenders.  The field appears to have narrowed to the occasionally befuddled and befuddling Joe Biden as the standard-bearer of moderation, and the nimble, plan-a-minute star of the campaign to date, Elizabeth Warren, with her progressive program of social and fiscal reform. Snapping at their heels, from a growing distance, is Bernie Sanders, with voice raised. His habitual dyspepsia has been sharpened by the way Warren steals his revolutionary thunder. No socialist, she; on the contrary,  Warren calls herself a “capitalist to my bones,”  but ready, unlike Biden, to tax the superrich who have skewed America’s promise. That’s her economic patriotism — a smart way to fight Donald Trump’s economic nationalism.  Some game-changer may yet come along. Biden could blow himself up with a shocking moment of incoherence or insult that goes beyond his known liabilities. He has already come close to that. He will be  more  exposed in the months ahead than he was as vice president at the no-drama White House. If the moderate Democratic ground opens up, the temptation for Michael Bloomberg to fill it may prove overwhelming, or, just possibly, another candidate — Kamala Harris, Cory Booker — will gain that elusive traction.  If Warren widens her lead over Sanders, will he withdraw in a way that might wrap it up for her? Railroaded out in 2016, when the Bernie-buzz was fresh, he will not, I suspect, be inclined to favors. Mr. Magnanimous he is not. Warren will have to fight it out. On the evidence, that will galvanize her. Biden is trying to bridge reassurance to the wealthy with outreach to energized progressives. That balancing act has maintained his lead in polls. If two Obama terms were not enough for you, he’s offering something resembling a third — Obamacare Plus;   a possible increase in capital-gains tax to address inequality.  Will this fine-tuning be enough in an agitated America, whiplashed by President Trump? I doubt it.  The under-30s, maybe under-40s, are underwhelmed by Biden , even angry that this honorable man has not chosen dignified retirement. He’s the emblem of the permanent political class, the one that  created  the conditions for Trump, in an era that Trump’s wild policy lurches and heresies and, yes, lies have now transformed. America’s restoration, after this trauma, will not be achieved by going back. What created Trump cannot oust Trump.   It will demand a new politics, and a new integrity, such as the one Warren has set out and embodied with greater vigor, persuasiveness and coherence than anyone else. Biden, on whom  Trump may have been seeking dirt in a July phone call  with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, can put an end to the president’s sullying of the Oval Office. He can’t, however, embody renewal. Is Warren too far left to win?   Maybe. Does she worry some purple-district Democrats who did well in 2018? Yes. But she can adjust. As for “electability,” an overused word, well, Trump won, and may again, so all bets are off. I said Biden has come close to a blowup moment. The campaign is grueling. You don’t have to be almost 77 to slip up. But he has demonstrated tone-deafness on race in a way that is disturbing. His reference to a  “record player” in the last Democratic debate  in the context of a question about reparations for slavery tied Biden to a bygone era, but that was far from the worst of it. Talking about black families — that is what the question was about — he actually said: “We bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It’s not that they don’t want to help. They don’t, they don’t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television — excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the, the — — make sure the kids hear words.” They don’t know what to do! Make sure the kids hear words ! This is insulting toward African-Americans. It’s of a piece with Biden’s comment (quickly adjusted) in August that “we have this notion that somehow if you’re poor, you cannot do it. Poor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids.” There’s a way, and a need, to talk about fundamental systemic racial injustice, but this is emphatically not it. Black does not equal poor and inept. The genius has left a void. Right now it’s not his vice president who may just fill it enough, but Warren.

"Presidents these days always seem to get worse, don’t they?  To many on the left, Donald Trump is an order of magnitude more disastrous a commander in chief than was George W. Bush, whose reputation now stands thoroughly  rehabilitated  in the popular culture. Bush is no longer the incurious man who launched an unnecessary  war  that killed  hundreds of thousands  in Iraq; today, he’s the goofy old fella who  paints portraits of the troops ,  pals around with Michelle Obama  and seems to be in on the joke of our times.  “Sorta makes me look pretty good, doesn’t it?” Bush  has been reported  to smirk about the Trump era.  For the record, I think the jury is still out on whether Trump is worse than Bush. But for most of 2019, I’ve been trying to picture a future that elevates Trump in the same way it did Bush: How much worse could all t his  get? And worse in what direction — what politics, policies, rhetoric and media mastery will the next extremely terrible president marshal to ruin America anew?  In short: What sort of character do we have to imagine occupying the White House in 2029 to make lefties like myself feel even a slight pang of nostalgia for the good old days of Donald J. Trump?  The thought experiment is instructive because it compels us to ponder some of the fundamental forces shaping American culture and politics at the moment. It is also horrifying, because what quickly becomes evident is that we  might  now be only in the middle of everything spinning out of control.  Come, take a stroll with me through my recurrent nightmare: It’s the sweltering summer of 2029, and the man in charge is Tucker Carlson — that is, President Tucker Carlson, the one-time Fox News talker turned righteous, white nationalist economic populist, now in his triumphant second term, after having defeated the incumbent Joseph “Recession Joe” Biden back in 2024. Like Trump, President Carlson  spends  his first term refashioning America along racial lines. But unlike Trump, whose one term is now regarded by much of the right as a best-forgotten political disaster,  Carlson  advances an ethnonationalist populism that succeeds in  a  wild, frightening fashion. His secret: competence, a commitment to true political realignment, and a brutal online political machine that represents the full flowering of the tactics and ideology first displayed during  2014’s Gamergate  movement. Where Trump was a chaotic, undisciplined narcissist, the Carlson who wins in 2024 is a canny political strategist who makes good on Trump’s forgotten promise to embrace anti-corporate economic policies. On paper, parts of Carlson’s agenda seem ripped from the former liberal firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren (now in exile in Toronto): His  chief enemies  are Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, the megacorporations owned and staffed by wealthy liberals.  It’s a winning electoral formula: A large minority of Americans are willing to forgive Carlson’s authoritarian, nativist impulses if they see it as part of a war against the out-of-touch, culture-destroying corporations that are automating our jobs; killing every other industry; and exercising complete control over what we watch, read, listen to, buy and believe. And in America, thanks to the Electoral College, winning over a large minority is good enough to  regularly win the presidency .  Obviously I am making all of this up. But my premonition is based on months of research — this is what you might call an  educated  nightmare. My education: Carlson’s own nightly Fox News show, which I’ve been watching obsessively since January. I began tuning in because Carlson — who,  with nearly three million viewers a night , is the second most popular host on cable, after Sean Hannity — has become one of the most fascinatingly terrifying men in conservative media.  There are  two  things that terrify and fascinate me about Carlson. First,  unlike  most  Republican  lawmakers today, Carlson is sketching an economic vision of a post-Trump America that departs in key ways from Trumpism, especially in its muscular anti-corporate, populist zeal.  In January,  in a commentary that went viral on the right , Carlson excoriated American political leaders for their commitment to empty capitalism: “For our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer,”  he said . “They teach us it’s more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids.”  He regularly criticizes the tech giants , whom he argues are censoring his and his followers’ views. But he also hates corporations more generally for what he calls their attempts to influence culture and politics (including  by boycotting his show ): His critics,  he said in May , “believe democracy is when a tiny group of rich people imposes its values on everyone else by force.""  In June,  Carlson praised Elizabeth Warren’s plan for “economic patriotism” : “Many of Warren’s policy prescriptions make obvious sense,” he said, wondering why Republicans, including Trump, didn’t join her vision. “What if the Republican leadership here in Washington had bothered to learn the lessons of the 2016 election?” The second thing that scares me about Carlson is his racism, which is both more extreme and more cannily packaged for a digital audience than is Trump’s.  While Trump is a creature of cable television, Carlson’s segments look like extended YouTube clips, and they’re designed to play to an audience that is  extremely online.  His critics and  white supremacists themselves  point out that, more than anyone else on television, Carlson functions as a kind of  laundromat for white identity movements : Several times a week, he’ll lift ideas, story lines and troll-based narratives directly from the fetid swamp of online hatred. Then he’ll clean these theories up and wrap them in a bow for his mainstream audience, usually to advance an overarching idea that he mentions constantly: that, thanks to  an “invasion” of immigrants , white people in America and Europe face economic and cultural calamity, and that the political, corporate and media establishments are abetting their destruction.  “No one covers white identity more consistently than Tucker,” said Madeline Peltz, who  watches Carlson’s show every night  as a researcher for Media Matters for America, a liberal advocacy group that tracks conservative outlets. “I cannot remember a single episode in the last two years that didn’t include these  ideas. ” I’d known all this before I started watching, but actually watching blew my mind: Carlson’s propaganda was so constant, and the sleight of hand with which he inserted barely sanitized racist theories into his broadcast so swift, that I began to see the outlines of my nightmare — that Trump was only a prelude, and that even if he loses next year, someone far more sophisticated than our current president could come along to push digitally mediated politics in an even darker direction.  Carlson — who talks often with Trump, and was reportedly instrumental in advising Trump against  attacking Iran in June  —  recently disclaimed any interest in running for president . He has been a nimble shape-shifter over the course of his career (a decade ago,  he was a libertarian ), so it’s possible that his latest critiques of capitalism are  just an act .  But he may also have noticed that  there are lots of conservative voters in America who don’t care for the Republican Party’s giveaways to corporations . Hence the outlines of a political vision: Carlson is aiming to mix a lefty-sounding economic agenda with a white nationalist-inspired cultural agenda — and to muddy the marriage by arguing that his and his followers’ ideas are being  stifled by the tech giants that he’s fighting .  This is Carlson’s entire schtick. He uses the cover of capitalist hardship to advance theories of white oppression, often  while summoning further harassment of his critics . He’s taking it to television, five nights a week. And where it ends up could be hellish. Office Hours With Farhad Manjoo Farhad wants to  chat with readers on the phone .

"Fox News Flash top headlines for Sept. 21 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com The University of  Iowa  has reopened an investigation into allegations by members of the school's marching band that they were verbally abused and physically assaulted during last weekend's game against rival  Iowa State  University. Members of the Hawkeye Marching Band allege that they were subjected to racial slurs and other verbal abuse, and sexual harassment before, during and after the game. Two band members told the  Cedar Rapids Gazette  that a third band member, a woman was hospitalized with fractured ribs.

       Administrators at the two schools announced earlier in the week that they had looked into the allegations, but they didn't say whether anyone would face punishment. Iowa's athletic director, Gary Barta, and his Iowa State counterpart, Jamie Pollard, released a joint statement saying members of both schools' bands had been subjected to ""rude, vulgar, and in some cases violent"" conduct at football games in recent years, and urging fans to stop the behavior. FOOTBALL FAN WHO REQUESTED BEER MONEY ON TV REVEALS HE'S RAISED $820G FOR CHILDREN'S CHARITY In response, 21-year-old Corey Knopp, who plays tenor sax for the Iowa Marching Band, posted his account of the abuse following the game, which Iowa won 18-17. ""People were physically assaulted,"" Knopp said. ""We expect to get booed and cussed at. But never for violence to take place...Put yourself in our shoes. Kids. Marching in formation back to our busses after a long day. Getting shoved and having beer cans shaken and sprayed at our feet. Getting slapped because of the words on our uniform (IOWA). Getting pushed so hard that someone’s (not going to name this person) ribs are broken. That is completely unacceptable."" BERNIE SANDERS' IOWA POLITICAL DIRECTOR HAS LEFT CAMPAIGN, REPORTS SAY Knopp also detailed to the Gazette how an Iowa State fan shoved him as they were marching back to the team buses. ""He decided to cut through the band and shoved me out of his way. I yelled, ‘Do not put your hands on me sir,’ and he yelled back, ‘F--k you.’” Nathan Topping, a 19-year-old trumpet player, told the Gazette a full beer bottle was thrown at him, causing what he described as a ""nasty bruise."" ""It was the fans,"" said Paige Pearson, 20, who plays trumpet in the Iowa band. ""The Iowa State band has been nothing but kind. They've reached out to us and said sorry this happened. It was not even the students, but adult fans."" University of Iowa spokeswoman Jeneane Beck said Friday that the social media posts made it clear that the university hadn’t adequately conveyed to its students what it had done to address the band members’ concerns, the Gazette reported. “Student safety is our number one priority and we are committed to ensuring a safe experience on game day for our students,” Beck said. “Additionally we are continuing our investigation to ensure all of our students have the ability to share their experiences with the appropriate authorities.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Iowa officials said Friday in a message to band members that Barta and Pollard “have been actively engaged in the process and have publicly pledged to ensure better protections for students moving forward.” The Associated Press contributed to this report. "
"Despite major holes in The New York Times story, members of 'The Squad' are calling for Brett Kavanaugh's impeachment and other top Democrats are attacking the FBI's investigation into the allegations; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' The latest smear on Supreme Court Justice  Brett Kavanaugh  is a disaster for Democrats, and everyone seems to know it except the party's presidential candidates. No sooner had The New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, then most of the candidates demanded Kavanaugh's  impeachment . ""These newest revelations are disturbing,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter, adding ""Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."" RUSH LIMBAUGH: TREATMENT OF TRUMP BY DEMOCRATS, MEDIA HAS AMERICANS 'QUIETLY SEETHING' Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Kavanaugh's ""place on the court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached."" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Obama housing secretary Julián Castro and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke joined in with impeachment calls of their own. Even former Vice President Joe Biden demanded Congress open an investigation and ""follow the evidence to wherever it leads."" That was considered the restrained response in the Democratic field. Never mind that the supposed victim has told friends she has no recollection of the alleged incident; facts have never stood in the Democrats' way when it comes to Kavanaugh before. If the Democratic presidential contenders want to see  Kavanaugh  impeached, I say go for it. Open the investigation Biden has demanded. Start impeachment hearings. And broadcast it for all of America to see. Let's remind voters of the disgraceful confirmation process Kavanaugh faced. Let's relive how Democrats accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, exposing himself to a college classmate and participating in gang rapes at high school parties -- all without a shred of corroborating evidence. Let's rehash Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, but this time with the knowledge that the principal witness Ford named to her alleged assault, Leland Keyser, is now on record saying she does not believe Ford. Let's remind Americans how Senate Democrats denied Kavanaugh the presumption of innocence and insisted that the burden was on him to prove he was not a sexual predator. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER That sure worked out well for Democrats last time around. In 2018, the Kavanaugh debacle may have cost Democrats control of the Senate. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D.-Mo., lost their seats thanks to voters disgusted by their party's campaign of character assassination against Kavanaugh, while Democrats blew a chance to pick up GOP seats in Tennessee and Texas. As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at the time, the Kavanaugh hearings were ""like an adrenaline shot"" for the Republican base. Now, Democrats want to bring out the hypodermic needle for the 2020 elections. Sounds good to me. On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders know this a path to disaster. In a stunning rebuke of the party's presidential contenders, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told those calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment to ""get real."" ""We've got to get beyond this 'impeachment is the answer to every problem,'"" Durbin said. ""It's become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you're unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. ... If that's how we are identified ... we run the risk that people will feel we're ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was even more succinct. Asked if the House was going to investigate the new allegation, she said ""no."" Durbin and Pelosi understand that the threats to impeach Kavanaugh are a godsend for Trump. And they come in the wake of Senate Democrats issuing an unprecedented threat to the other Supreme Court justices. In a brief, they warned that if the high court does not rule as Democrats wish in a gun case, they could ""restructure"" the court when they take power in the 2020 elections -- packing it with liberal justices, flipping a 5-to-4 conservative majority to a liberal majority. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats do not seem to realize that when they make threats like these, they are not hurting Kavanaugh or Trump, they are hurting themselves. In 2016, 26 percent of Trump voters said Supreme Court nominees were the most important issue to them, while only 18 percent of Hillary Clinton's voters mirrored the sentiment. As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose. In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Kavanaugh or liberal court-packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should. So, let the impeachment proceedings begin. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MARC THIESSEN"
"The Deep State tried to use an illegitimate tool to throw up a smokescreen to distract the American people from President Trump's success, says former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. The Democratic media  narrative  of impeachment portrays President Trump and his administration as serial law-breakers who, true to form, obstruct all congressional investigations of wrongdoing. This then becomes the analytical framework for every new controversy. There are at least two fundamental problems with this. First, our constitutional system is based on friction between competing  branches  vested with separate but closely related powers. The framers understood that the two political branches would periodically try to usurp each other’s authorities. Congress often does this by enactments that seek to subject executive power to congressional (or judicial) supervision. Presidential pushback on such laws is not criminal obstruction; it is the Constitution in action. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Second, we’ve become so law-obsessed that we miss the forest for the trees. Often, the least important aspect of a controversy — viz., whether a law has been violated — becomes the dominant  consideration . Short shrift is given to the more consequential aspects, such as whether we are being competently governed or whether power is being abused. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP These problems are now playing out in the Trump controversy du jour (or should I say de l’heure?): the intelligence community whistleblower. As this column is written on Friday afternoon, the story is still evolving, with the president tweeting as ever, and The New York Times producing a report by no fewer than eight of its top journalists, joining the seven (and counting) who are working it for the Washington Post, which broke the story.

"There was a lot of drama. Senator Cory Booker, by way of greeting, lifted one of the moderators of Friday night’s  L.G.B.T.Q. Presidential Forum  right off the floor in a great bear hug. Later, an audience member interrupted Senator Amy Klobuchar with what sounded like an appeal to “protect sex workers.” And then there was Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who was asked what it would feel like to serve as president of a country for which he could not, under current regulations, donate his blood. But the most breathtaking moment, by my reckoning, belonged to Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said that she wasn’t just going to tell us what she’d do in her first 100 days. She would show us. And then she read aloud the names of the  18 transgender women of color  who have been murdered this year, in a voice that quavered with emotion. “It is time,” she concluded, “for a president of the United States of America to say their names.” Those names are Dana Martin, Jazzaline Ware, Ashanti Carmon, Claire Legato,  Muhlaysia Booker , Michelle Tamika Washington, Paris Cameron,  Chynal Lindsey , Chanel Scurlock, Zoe Spears, Brooklyn Lindsey, Denali Berries Stuckey, Kiki Fantroy, Pebbles LaDime “Dime” Doe, Tracy Single, Bailey Reeves, Bee Love Slater, and  Ja’leyah-Jamar . It was a historic night — the first time candidates for president have been brought together to discuss queer issues, in an event sponsored by  The Gazette , the  Advocate ,  One Iowa , and  GLAAD  (the L.G.B.T.Q. nonprofit which I served as national co-chair for four years). Cory Booker was the star of the first hour. After he bear-hugged  Zach Stafford , the editor of the Advocate, he gave a speech that was, for all its brevity, a barn burner. “You cannot lead the people,” he said, “if you do not love the people.” Meanwhile, as an older American — and one from Pennsylvania at that — I have a longtime affection for former Vice President Joe Biden, a fondness that has occasionally put me at odds with a younger generation of queer activists. I had hoped that Biden’s appearance at the forum would finally put to rest the uncertainty around his candidacy. That didn’t happen. Instead, — I’m so sorry to have to say this — he appeared, once again, to be  phoning it in . He said a few passionate but circuitous words as he stepped onto the stage, then looked over at the host, Lyz Lenz, an Iowa-based writer. “Do I go sit down?” he asked. She nodded. “Honestly, I thought you’d go a little longer.” Later, when she asked about Biden’s description of Mike Pence as “a decent guy,” he just looked at her and said, “You’re a lovely person.” Backstage, Lenz said, Biden had called her “sweetheart.” It may well be that this was, once again, just Joe being Joe. But — to put it mildly — he’s wearing me down. He has to do better. Pete Buttigieg had a good night; so did Julián Castro. Senator Kamala Harris did well enough, but I had hoped she’d show some of the grace and magic on display in the first debate. That didn’t happen, either. There were three losers of the forum, all Republicans: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, and the president himself. Many of the candidates took special note to lament the actions of the trio: DeVos, for  refusing to investigate complaints  by trans students in schools; Carson for his  horrific description  of trans women this week as “big hairy men;” and Donald Trump for pretty much everything: for the damage his administration has done to queer America, and for his passion, as abetted by Russian trolls, for pitting us against one another. Another loser last night was Senator Bernie Sanders, who did not show. There’s  a second forum  coming up in October, sponsored by U.C.L.A. and the Human Rights Campaign. Sanders isn’t going to that one, either. His campaign cites scheduling conflicts. Some of the other winners weren’t candidates. Angelica Ross, the chief moderator, was poised and fierce; you could make the case that she was more electrifying than any of people actually in the race. The sponsors of the event had a lot to celebrate as well, just for the fact of pulling this whole thing off. GLAAD’s chief executive,  Sarah Kate Ellis , provided a poised, articulate keynote as the evening began. As I listened to her, it occurred to me — and not for the first time — that I wouldn’t mind it one bit if she ran for president herself. Which is more than I can say about some people. But it was Warren and Booker who shone brightest. Warren, when asked about some Americans objecting to the morality of queer lives, responded with the parable in Matthew 25 about the sheep and the goats. “Whatever you have done for the least of my brothers and sisters,” she read, quoting Christ, “you did for me.” I would hope that this passage from Scripture gives Mike Pence something to think about. Booker, in making an appeal for a revival of civic grace, was nothing short of inspirational. Is this the moment he breaks out of the middle of the pack, and rises into the top tier? We’ll know soon enough. “What does love look like in public?” he asked. “It looks like justice.” The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters  to the editor.

"Former Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign chief strategist Mark Penn reacts to the latest numbers. Former Vice President  Joe Biden’s  many gaffes don’t mean he’s mentally unfit to be president, but if they raise enough questions with voters they might prevent him from getting the Democratic presidential nomination, or from getting elected if he becomes the nominee. Biden, his two leading competitors in the Democratic presidential primaries and  President Trump  are all in their 70s. The oldest is Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 78, followed by Biden at 76, Trump at 73, and Sen. Elizabeth of Warren of Massachusetts at 70. Are all four too old for what is probably one of the most intellectually challenging jobs in the world, with enormous power over our lives and the future of the planet? FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN AT NEW LOW IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE Biden, Sanders, Warren and Trump all keep demanding and high-pressure schedules, traveling frequently, often getting little sleep, and speaking on an almost daily basis in front of TV cameras to answer questions from reporters and to address audiences large and small. That takes stamina and a quick mind. But because they speak in public so often and most of what they say is recorded, each of them sometimes generates news stories when saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. Biden, however, seems to exceed the average for the number of these gaffes. And because the former vice president’s frequent gaffes have now become an issue raising questions about his fitness to serve as president, they are getting outsized attention in the media and from his opponents. Still, at this early stage in the 2020 presidential race Biden remains the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. A  Fox News poll  that came out this week shows Biden has the support of 29 percent of likely Democratic primary voters, compared with 18 percent for Sanders and 16 percent for Warren. However, Biden’s solid lead was down by two points since August and six points since May. Biden has almost universal name recognition among voters from his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president and 36 years in the Senate before that. A centrist who doesn’t embrace the more far-left policies of Sanders and Warren, Biden has strong appeal for many voters because of his more moderate positions and because they believe he can make Trump a one-term president. But what about all the Biden gaffes? His critics are raising questions about his mental fitness and whether he could be suffering from the early stages of dementia that could grow markedly worse at the end of a potential two terms in the White House. So far the Democratic presidential candidate going after Trump most directly on the mental fitness issue is former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, who aggressively attacked Biden in the last presidential debate, accusing Biden of forgetting a comment he had made just minutes earlier. But it turns out that Castro was the one who forgot what Biden said. Does the fact that Castro got mixed up mean he is suffering from dementia? Look, dementia isn’t diagnosed by watching someone on a podium at a televised debate, where candidates are required to instantly respond to questions and sum up complex issues in a minute or less. And once in office, presidents have advisers and briefings and time to learn and think about issues. No one is ever going to say to a president: Sir (or someday Madam), tell me in 60 seconds how to end terrorism, or end poverty, or improve our educational system, or balance the federal budget. And when we look at Biden’s gaffes and question if he is possibly “losing it” or if he’s fit for office, we shouldn’t forget that President Trump certainly has made quite a few gaffes of his own. More importantly, according to The Washington Post’s  Fact Checker database , as of Aug. 5 Trump “had made 12,019 false or misleading claims.” “President Trump’s proclivity for spouting exaggerated numbers, unwarranted boasts and outright falsehoods has continued at a remarkable pace,” a Post article reported. Of course, the president and his supporters strongly dispute the Post tally, and the president regularly denounces the newspaper as biased against him and as purveying “fake news.” But if voters are concerned about instances where Biden gets a bit confused at times and inadvertently says the wrong thing, they should be even more concerned about Trump’s “false and misleading claims.” We all accidentally say the wrong thing sometimes and forget things or remember past events incorrectly. Those are innocent mistakes. And we all age differently. Some people are past their peak mental performance in their 60s and some even have dementia at that age. Others are just fine mentally in their 80s and even beyond. Space doesn’t permit a listing of all Biden’s gaffes, simply because there are so many. But importantly, he’s been making these gaffes for decades, going back to when he was a young man and in middle age. That hasn’t prevented him from devoting a lifetime to public service and accomplishing a great deal for the American people. But let’s look at just a few of Biden’s gaffes. Recently Biden has urged parents to keep “record players” on to improve the vocabulary of their children. He said he was in Vermont when he was really in New Hampshire. Biden said in August that he was still vice president at the time of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb.14, 2018 – when he had been out of office for more than a year.  An official with Biden’s campaign later said Biden had meant to refer to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, which occurred in December 2012. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER And one of Biden’s gaffes, which was a favorite for many and quite funny, came during CNN’s July 31 presidential debate, when he asked voters to “go to Joe 30330.” He said later he meant to say “text.” “I was so focused on making the case for Joe, I said ‘Joe’ and I gave the number,” he said. According to the Alzheimer’s Association: “There is no one test to determine if someone has dementia.  Doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia based on a careful medical history, a physical examination, laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day function and behavior associated with each type.” I’m not a doctor and I certainly can’t diagnose Biden’s mental abilities. But you would think if he really was slipping mentally his own doctors, his wife, other family members and the people who work with him every day would notice something was seriously wrong. And you would think Biden himself would notice and conclude for his own health and for the good of the country he deeply loves that he should withdraw from the presidential race – or resign from the presidency, should he become president and be stricken with dementia. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The bottom line is that opponents attack each other in campaigns. This has begun happening in the 2020 presidential race and is going to get a lot worse. As the Democratic front-runner, Biden is a magnet for attacks – as always happens with front-runners. My best advice to Biden is to focus on trying to reduce the number of gaffes he makes, working with his top advisers. He has an outstanding record in government and shouldn’t be pushed out of the race for slips of the tongue, as long as they don’t indicate he has more serious problems that make him unfit to be our next president.
